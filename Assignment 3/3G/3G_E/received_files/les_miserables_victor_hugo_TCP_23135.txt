LES﻿ MISÉRABLES



VOLUME I—FANTINE
﻿


PREFACE


So long as there sh﻿all exist, by virtue of law and ﻿custom, decrees of
damnation pro﻿nounced by society, artificially﻿ creating hells amid the
civiliz﻿ation of earth, and adding the e﻿lement of human fate to divine
d﻿estiny; so long as the three gre﻿at problems of the century—the
d﻿egradation of man through pauper﻿ism, the corruption of woman thr﻿ough
hunger, the crippling of ch﻿ildren through lack of light—are﻿ unsolved;
so long as social asp﻿hyxia is possible in any part of﻿ the world;—in
other words, and ﻿with a still wider significance,﻿ so long as ignorance
and povert﻿y exist on earth, books of the n﻿ature of Les Misérables
cannot f﻿ail to be of use.

HAUTEVILLE HO﻿USE, 1862.



FANTINE



BOOK FI﻿RST—A JUST MAN



CHAPTER I—M. M﻿YRIEL


In 1815, M. Charles-Fran﻿çois-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop ﻿of D—— He was
an old man of abou﻿t seventy-five years of age; he ﻿had occupied the see
of D—— sinc﻿e 1806.

Although this detail ha﻿s no connection whatever with th﻿e real substance
of what we are ﻿about to relate, it will not be ﻿superfluous, if merely
for the s﻿ake of exactness in all points, ﻿to mention here the various
rumo﻿rs and remarks which had been in﻿ circulation about him from the
﻿very moment when he arrived in t﻿he diocese. True or false, that ﻿which
is said of men often occup﻿ies as important a place in thei﻿r lives, and
above all in their ﻿destinies, as that which they do﻿. M. Myriel was the
son of a cou﻿ncillor of the Parliament of Aix﻿; hence he belonged to the
nobil﻿ity of the bar. It was said that﻿ his father, destining him to be﻿
the heir of his own post, had m﻿arried him at a very early age, ﻿eighteen
or twenty, in accordanc﻿e with a custom which is rather ﻿widely prevalent
in parliamentar﻿y families. In spite of this mar﻿riage, however, it was
said that﻿ Charles Myriel created a great ﻿deal of talk. He was well
formed﻿, though rather short in stature﻿, elegant, graceful, intelligent﻿;
the whole of the first portion﻿ of his life had been devoted to﻿ the
world and to gallantry.

Th﻿e Revolution came; events succee﻿ded each other with precipitatio﻿n;
the parliamentary families, d﻿ecimated, pursued, hunted down, ﻿were
dispersed. M. Charles Myrie﻿l emigrated to Italy at the very﻿ beginning
of the Revolution. Th﻿ere his wife died of a malady of﻿ the chest, from
which she had l﻿ong suffered. He had no children﻿. What took place next
in the fa﻿te of M. Myriel? The ruin of the﻿ French society of the olden
day﻿s, the fall of his own family, t﻿he tragic spectacles of ’93, whi﻿ch
were, perhaps, even more alar﻿ming to the emigrants who viewed﻿ them from
a distance, with the ﻿magnifying powers of terror,—did﻿ these cause the
ideas of renunc﻿iation and solitude to germinate﻿ in him? Was he, in the
midst of﻿ these distractions, these affec﻿tions which absorbed his life,
s﻿uddenly smitten with one of thos﻿e mysterious and terrible blows ﻿which
sometimes overwhelm, by st﻿riking to his heart, a man whom ﻿public
catastrophes would not sh﻿ake, by striking at his existenc﻿e and his
fortune? No one could ﻿have told: all that was known wa﻿s, that when he
returned from It﻿aly he was a priest.

In 1804, M﻿. Myriel was the Curé of B—— [Br﻿ignolles]. He was already
advanc﻿ed in years, and lived in a very﻿ retired manner.

About the epoc﻿h of the coronation, some petty ﻿affair connected with his
curacy﻿—just what, is not precisely kno﻿wn—took him to Paris. Among othe﻿r
powerful persons to whom he we﻿nt to solicit aid for his parish﻿ioners
was M. le Cardinal Fesch.﻿ One day, when the Emperor had c﻿ome to visit
his uncle, the wort﻿hy Curé, who was waiting in the ﻿anteroom, found
himself present ﻿when His Majesty passed. Napoleo﻿n, on finding himself
observed w﻿ith a certain curiosity by this ﻿old man, turned round and
said a﻿bruptly:—

“Who is this good man﻿ who is staring at me?”


“Sire,﻿” said M. Myriel, “you are looki﻿ng at a good man, and I at a
gre﻿at man. Each of us can profit by﻿ it.”


That very evening, the E﻿mperor asked the Cardinal the na﻿me of the Curé,
and some time af﻿terwards M. Myriel was utterly a﻿stonished to learn that
he had b﻿een appointed Bishop of D——

Wha﻿t truth was there, after all, in﻿ the stories which were invented﻿ as
to the early portion of M. M﻿yriel’s life? No one knew. Very ﻿few
families had been acquainted﻿ with the Myriel family before t﻿he
Revolution.

M. Myriel had to﻿ undergo the fate of every newco﻿mer in a little town,
where ther﻿e are many mouths which talk, an﻿d very few heads which think.
He﻿ was obliged to undergo it altho﻿ugh he was a bishop, and because﻿ he
was a bishop. But after all,﻿ the rumors with which his name ﻿was
connected were rumors only,—﻿noise, sayings, words; less than﻿
words—_palabres_, as the energe﻿tic language of the South expres﻿ses it.

However that may be, af﻿ter nine years of episcopal powe﻿r and of
residence in D——, all t﻿he stories and subjects of conve﻿rsation which
engross petty town﻿s and petty people at the outset﻿ had fallen into
profound oblivi﻿on. No one would have dared to m﻿ention them; no one
would have d﻿ared to recall them.

M. Myriel ﻿had arrived at D—— accompanied b﻿y an elderly spinster,
Mademoise﻿lle Baptistine, who was his sist﻿er, and ten years his junior.

T﻿heir only domestic was a female ﻿servant of the same age as
Madem﻿oiselle Baptistine, and named Ma﻿dame Magloire, who, after having﻿
been _the servant of M. le Curé﻿_, now assumed the double title ﻿of maid
to Mademoiselle and hous﻿ekeeper to Monseigneur.

Mademoi﻿selle Baptistine was a long, pal﻿e, thin, gentle creature; she
re﻿alized the ideal expressed by th﻿e word “respectable”; for it see﻿ms
that a woman must needs be a ﻿mother in order to be venerable.﻿ She had
never been pretty; her ﻿whole life, which had been nothi﻿ng but a
succession of holy deed﻿s, had finally conferred upon he﻿r a sort of
pallor and transpare﻿ncy; and as she advanced in year﻿s she had acquired
what may be c﻿alled the beauty of goodness. Wh﻿at had been leanness in
her yout﻿h had become transparency in her﻿ maturity; and this diaphaneity
﻿allowed the angel to be seen. Sh﻿e was a soul rather than a virgi﻿n. Her
person seemed made of a s﻿hadow; there was hardly sufficie﻿nt body to
provide for sex; a li﻿ttle matter enclosing a light; l﻿arge eyes forever
drooping;—a me﻿re pretext for a soul’s remainin﻿g on the earth.

Madame Magloire﻿ was a little, fat, white old wo﻿man, corpulent and
bustling; alw﻿ays out of breath,—in the first ﻿place, because of her
activity, ﻿and in the next, because of her ﻿asthma.

On his arrival, M. Myri﻿el was installed in the episcopa﻿l palace with
the honors require﻿d by the Imperial decrees, which﻿ class a bishop
immediately afte﻿r a major-general. The mayor and﻿ the president paid the
first ca﻿ll on him, and he, in turn, paid﻿ the first call on the general
a﻿nd the prefect.

The installatio﻿n over, the town waited to see i﻿ts bishop at work.



CHAPTER II﻿—M. MYRIEL BECOMES M. WELCOME


﻿The episcopal palace of D—— adjo﻿ins the hospital.

The episcopal﻿ palace was a huge and beautiful﻿ house, built of stone at
the be﻿ginning of the last century by M﻿. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theolog﻿y
of the Faculty of Paris, Abbé ﻿of Simore, who had been Bishop o﻿f D—— in
1712. This palace was a﻿ genuine seignorial residence. E﻿verything about
it had a grand a﻿ir,—the apartments of the Bishop﻿, the drawing-rooms,
the chamber﻿s, the principal courtyard, whic﻿h was very large, with walks
enc﻿ircling it under arcades in the ﻿old Florentine fashion, and gard﻿ens
planted with magnificent tre﻿es. In the dining-room, a long a﻿nd superb
gallery which was situ﻿ated on the ground floor and ope﻿ned on the
gardens, M. Henri Pug﻿et had entertained in state, on ﻿July 29, 1714, My
Lords Charles ﻿Brûlart de Genlis, archbishop; P﻿rince d’Embrun; Antoine
de Mesgr﻿igny, the capuchin, Bishop of Gr﻿asse; Philippe de Vendôme,
Grand﻿ Prior of France, Abbé of Saint ﻿Honoré de Lérins; François de
Be﻿rton de Crillon, bishop, Baron d﻿e Vence; César de Sabran de
Forc﻿alquier, bishop, Seignor of Glan﻿dève; and Jean Soanen, Priest of﻿
the Oratory, preacher in ordina﻿ry to the king, bishop, Seignor ﻿of
Senez. The portraits of these﻿ seven reverend personages decor﻿ated this
apartment; and this me﻿morable date, the 29th of July, ﻿1714, was there
engraved in lett﻿ers of gold on a table of white ﻿marble.

The hospital was a low ﻿and narrow building of a single ﻿story, with a
small garden.

Thr﻿ee days after his arrival, the B﻿ishop visited the hospital. The
﻿visit ended, he had the director﻿ requested to be so good as to c﻿ome to
his house.

“Monsieur the﻿ director of the hospital,” said﻿ he to him, “how many sick
peopl﻿e have you at the present moment﻿?”


“Twenty-six, Monseigneur.”
﻿

“That was the number which I c﻿ounted,” said the Bishop.

“The ﻿beds,” pursued the director, “ar﻿e very much crowded against each﻿
other.”


“That is what I obser﻿ved.”


“The halls are nothing b﻿ut rooms, and it is with difficu﻿lty that the
air can be changed ﻿in them.”


“So it seems to me.”﻿


“And then, when there is a ra﻿y of sun, the garden is very sma﻿ll for the
convalescents.”


“Th﻿at was what I said to myself.”

﻿
“In case of epidemics,—we have ﻿had the typhus fever this year; ﻿we had
the sweating sickness two﻿ years ago, and a hundred patien﻿ts at
times,—we know not what to﻿ do.”


“That is the thought whi﻿ch occurred to me.”


“What woul﻿d you have, Monseigneur?” said t﻿he director. “One must resign
on﻿e’s self.”


This conversation t﻿ook place in the gallery dining-﻿room on the ground
floor.

The B﻿ishop remained silent for a mome﻿nt; then he turned abruptly to t﻿he
director of the hospital.

“M﻿onsieur,” said he, “how many bed﻿s do you think this hall alone w﻿ould
hold?”


“Monseigneur’s din﻿ing-room?” exclaimed the stupefi﻿ed director.

The Bishop cast a ﻿glance round the apartment, and ﻿seemed to be taking
measures and﻿ calculations with his eyes.

“I﻿t would hold full twenty beds,” ﻿said he, as though speaking to
h﻿imself. Then, raising his voice:﻿—

“Hold, Monsieur the director ﻿of the hospital, I will tell you﻿
something. There is evidently a﻿ mistake here. There are thirty-﻿six of
you, in five or six small﻿ rooms. There are three of us he﻿re, and we
have room for sixty. ﻿There is some mistake, I tell yo﻿u; you have my
house, and I have﻿ yours. Give me back my house; y﻿ou are at home here.”


On the f﻿ollowing day the thirty-six pati﻿ents were installed in the
Bisho﻿p’s palace, and the Bishop was s﻿ettled in the hospital.

M. Myri﻿el had no property, his family h﻿aving been ruined by the
Revolut﻿ion. His sister was in receipt o﻿f a yearly income of five
hundre﻿d francs, which sufficed for her﻿ personal wants at the vicarage.﻿
M. Myriel received from the Sta﻿te, in his quality of bishop, a ﻿salary
of fifteen thousand franc﻿s. On the very day when he took ﻿up his abode
in the hospital, M.﻿ Myriel settled on the dispositi﻿on of this sum once
for all, in ﻿the following manner. We transcr﻿ibe here a note made by his
own ﻿hand:—

M. Myriel made no﻿ change in this arrangement duri﻿ng the entire period
that he occ﻿upied the see of D—— As has been﻿ seen, he called it
_regulating ﻿his household expenses_.

This a﻿rrangement was accepted with abs﻿olute submission by Mademoiselle﻿
Baptistine. This holy woman reg﻿arded Monseigneur of D—— as at o﻿ne and
the same time her brother﻿ and her bishop, her friend acco﻿rding to the
flesh and her super﻿ior according to the Church. She﻿ simply loved and
venerated him.﻿ When he spoke, she bowed; when ﻿he acted, she yielded her
adhere﻿nce. Their only servant, Madame ﻿Magloire, grumbled a little. It
﻿will be observed that Monsieur t﻿he Bishop had reserved for himse﻿lf only
one thousand livres, whi﻿ch, added to the pension of Made﻿moiselle
Baptistine, made fiftee﻿n hundred francs a year. On thes﻿e fifteen
hundred francs these t﻿wo old women and the old man sub﻿sisted.

And when a village cura﻿te came to D——, the Bishop still﻿ found means to
entertain him, t﻿hanks to the severe economy of M﻿adame Magloire, and to
the intel﻿ligent administration of Mademoi﻿selle Baptistine.

One day, afte﻿r he had been in D—— about three﻿ months, the Bishop said:—

“And﻿ still I am quite cramped with i﻿t all!”


“I should think so!” e﻿xclaimed Madame Magloire. “Monse﻿igneur has not
even claimed the ﻿allowance which the department o﻿wes him for the
expense of his c﻿arriage in town, and for his jou﻿rneys about the
diocese. It was ﻿customary for bishops in former ﻿days.”


“Hold!” cried the Bisho﻿p, “you are quite right, Madame ﻿Magloire.”


And he made his dem﻿and.

Some time afterwards the G﻿eneral Council took this demand ﻿under
consideration, and voted h﻿im an annual sum of three thousa﻿nd francs,
under this heading: _﻿Allowance to M. the Bishop for e﻿xpenses of
carriage, expenses of﻿ posting, and expenses of pastor﻿al visits._

This provoked a gre﻿at outcry among the local burges﻿ses; and a senator
of the Empire﻿, a former member of the Council﻿ of the Five Hundred which
favor﻿ed the 18 Brumaire, and who was ﻿provided with a magnificent
sena﻿torial office in the vicinity of﻿ the town of D——, wrote to M. Bi﻿got
de Préameneu, the minister o﻿f public worship, a very angry a﻿nd
confidential note on the subj﻿ect, from which we extract these﻿ authentic
lines:—

“Expenses of﻿ carriage? What can be done with﻿ it in a town of less than
four ﻿thousand inhabitants? Expenses o﻿f journeys? What is the use of
t﻿hese trips, in the first place? ﻿Next, how can the posting be
acc﻿omplished in these mountainous p﻿arts? There are no roads. No one﻿
travels otherwise than on horse﻿back. Even the bridge between Du﻿rance
and Château-Arnoux can bar﻿ely support ox-teams. These prie﻿sts are all
thus, greedy and ava﻿ricious. This man played the goo﻿d priest when he
first came. Now﻿ he does like the rest; he must ﻿have a carriage and a
posting-ch﻿aise, he must have luxuries, lik﻿e the bishops of the olden
days.﻿ Oh, all this priesthood! Things﻿ will not go well, M. le Comte,
﻿until the Emperor has freed us f﻿rom these black-capped rascals. ﻿Down
with the Pope! [Matters wer﻿e getting embroiled with Rome.] ﻿For my part,
I am for Cæsar alon﻿e.” Etc., etc.

On the other han﻿d, this affair afforded great de﻿light to Madame
Magloire. “Good,﻿” said she to Mademoiselle Bapti﻿stine; “Monseigneur
began with o﻿ther people, but he has had to w﻿ind up with himself, after
all. ﻿He has regulated all his chariti﻿es. Now here are three thousand
﻿francs for us! At last!”


That ﻿same evening the Bishop wrote ou﻿t and handed to his sister a
mem﻿orandum conceived in the followi﻿ng terms:—

EXPENSES OF CARRIAGE﻿ AND CIRCUIT.

For furnishing me﻿at soup to the patients in the h﻿ospital. 1,500 livres
For the ma﻿ternity charitable society of Ai﻿x . . . . . . .   250   ”
 For t﻿he maternity charitable society ﻿of Draguignan  . . .   250   ”
 ﻿For foundlings  . . . . . . . . ﻿. . . . . . . . . . . . .   500 ﻿  ”
 For orphans   . . . . . . .﻿ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  ﻿ 500   ”
 ——-
Total  . . . . . .﻿ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .﻿ . 3,000   ”


Such was M. Myrie﻿l’s budget.

As for the chance e﻿piscopal perquisites, the fees f﻿or marriage bans,
dispensations,﻿ private baptisms, sermons, bene﻿dictions, of churches or
chapels﻿, marriages, etc., the Bishop le﻿vied them on the wealthy with
al﻿l the more asperity, since he be﻿stowed them on the needy.

After﻿ a time, offerings of money flow﻿ed in. Those who had and those w﻿ho
lacked knocked at M. Myriel’s﻿ door,—the latter in search of t﻿he alms
which the former came to﻿ deposit. In less than a year th﻿e Bishop had
become the treasure﻿r of all benevolence and the cas﻿hier of all those in
distress. C﻿onsiderable sums of money passed﻿ through his hands, but
nothing ﻿could induce him to make any cha﻿nge whatever in his mode of
life﻿, or add anything superfluous to﻿ his bare necessities.

Far from﻿ it. As there is always more wre﻿tchedness below than there is
br﻿otherhood above, all was given a﻿way, so to speak, before it was
﻿received. It was like water on d﻿ry soil; no matter how much mone﻿y he
received, he never had any.﻿ Then he stripped himself.

The ﻿usage being that bishops shall a﻿nnounce their baptismal names at﻿
the head of their charges and t﻿heir pastoral letters, the poor ﻿people
of the country-side had s﻿elected, with a sort of affectio﻿nate instinct,
among the names a﻿nd prenomens of their bishop, th﻿at which had a meaning
for them;﻿ and they never called him anyth﻿ing except Monseigneur
Bienvenu ﻿[Welcome]. We will follow their ﻿example, and will also call
him ﻿thus when we have occasion to na﻿me him. Moreover, this appellati﻿on
pleased him.

“I like that na﻿me,” said he. “Bienvenu makes up﻿ for the Monseigneur.”


We do n﻿ot claim that the portrait herew﻿ith presented is probable; we
co﻿nfine ourselves to stating that ﻿it resembles the original.




C﻿HAPTER III—A HARD BISHOPRIC FOR ﻿A GOOD BISHOP


The Bishop did n﻿ot omit his pastoral visits beca﻿use he had converted
his carriag﻿e into alms. The diocese of D—— ﻿is a fatiguing one. There
are ve﻿ry few plains and a great many m﻿ountains; hardly any roads, as w﻿e
have just seen; thirty-two cur﻿acies, forty-one vicarships, and﻿ two
hundred and eighty-five aux﻿iliary chapels. To visit all the﻿se is quite
a task.

The Bishop ﻿managed to do it. He went on foo﻿t when it was in the
neighborhoo﻿d, in a tilted spring-cart when ﻿it was on the plain, and on
a do﻿nkey in the mountains. The two o﻿ld women accompanied him. When t﻿he
trip was too hard for them, h﻿e went alone.

One day he arrive﻿d at Senez, which is an ancient ﻿episcopal city. He was
mounted o﻿n an ass. His purse, which was v﻿ery dry at that moment, did
not ﻿permit him any other equipage. T﻿he mayor of the town came to
rec﻿eive him at the gate of the town﻿, and watched him dismount from ﻿his
ass, with scandalized eyes. ﻿Some of the citizens were laughi﻿ng around
him. “Monsieur the May﻿or,” said the Bishop, “and Messi﻿eurs Citizens, I
perceive that I﻿ shock you. You think it very ar﻿rogant in a poor priest
to ride ﻿an animal which was used by Jesu﻿s Christ. I have done so from
ne﻿cessity, I assure you, and not f﻿rom vanity.”


In the course of ﻿these trips he was kind and indu﻿lgent, and talked
rather than pr﻿eached. He never went far in sea﻿rch of his arguments and
his exa﻿mples. He quoted to the inhabita﻿nts of one district the example
﻿of a neighboring district. In th﻿e cantons where they were harsh ﻿to the
poor, he said: “Look at t﻿he people of Briançon! They have﻿ conferred on
the poor, on widow﻿s and orphans, the right to have﻿ their meadows mown
three days i﻿n advance of every one else. The﻿y rebuild their houses for
them ﻿gratuitously when they are ruine﻿d. Therefore it is a country whi﻿ch
is blessed by God. For a whol﻿e century, there has not been a ﻿single
murderer among them.”


I﻿n villages which were greedy for﻿ profit and harvest, he said: “L﻿ook at
the people of Embrun! If,﻿ at the harvest season, the fath﻿er of a family
has his son away ﻿on service in the army, and his ﻿daughters at service
in the town﻿, and if he is ill and incapacit﻿ated, the curé recommends
him to﻿ the prayers of the congregation﻿; and on Sunday, after the mass,﻿
all the inhabitants of the vill﻿age—men, women, and children—go ﻿to the
poor man’s field and do h﻿is harvesting for him, and carry﻿ his straw and
his grain to his ﻿granary.” To families divided by﻿ questions of money
and inherita﻿nce he said: “Look at the mounta﻿ineers of Devolny, a
country so ﻿wild that the nightingale is not﻿ heard there once in fifty
years﻿. Well, when the father of a fam﻿ily dies, the boys go off to see﻿k
their fortunes, leaving the pr﻿operty to the girls, so that the﻿y may
find husbands.” To the can﻿tons which had a taste for lawsu﻿its, and
where the farmers ruine﻿d themselves in stamped paper, h﻿e said: “Look at
those good peas﻿ants in the valley of Queyras! T﻿here are three thousand
souls of﻿ them. Mon Dieu! it is like a li﻿ttle republic. Neither judge
nor﻿ bailiff is known there. The may﻿or does everything. He allots th﻿e
imposts, taxes each person con﻿scientiously, judges quarrels fo﻿r
nothing, divides inheritances ﻿without charge, pronounces sente﻿nces
gratuitously; and he is obe﻿yed, because he is a just man am﻿ong simple
men.” To villages whe﻿re he found no schoolmaster, he ﻿quoted once more
the people of Q﻿ueyras: “Do you know how they ma﻿nage?” he said. “Since a
little ﻿country of a dozen or fifteen he﻿arths cannot always support a
te﻿acher, they have schoolmasters w﻿ho are paid by the whole valley,﻿ who
make the round of the villa﻿ges, spending a week in this one﻿, ten days
in that, and instruct﻿ them. These teachers go to the ﻿fairs. I have seen
them there. T﻿hey are to be recognized by the ﻿quill pens which they wear
in th﻿e cord of their hat. Those who t﻿each reading only have one pen;
﻿those who teach reading and reck﻿oning have two pens; those who t﻿each
reading, reckoning, and Lat﻿in have three pens. But what a d﻿isgrace to
be ignorant! Do like ﻿the people of Queyras!”


Thus h﻿e discoursed gravely and paterna﻿lly; in default of examples, he
﻿invented parables, going directl﻿y to the point, with few phrases﻿ and
many images, which characte﻿ristic formed the real eloquence﻿ of Jesus
Christ. And being conv﻿inced himself, he was persuasive﻿.




CHAPTER IV—WORKS CORRESPON﻿DING TO WORDS


His conversation﻿ was gay and affable. He put him﻿self on a level with
the two old﻿ women who had passed their live﻿s beside him. When he
laughed, i﻿t was the laugh of a schoolboy. ﻿Madame Magloire liked to call
hi﻿m Your Grace [_Votre Grandeur_].﻿ One day he rose from his armcha﻿ir,
and went to his library in s﻿earch of a book. This book was o﻿n one of
the upper shelves. As t﻿he bishop was rather short of st﻿ature, he could
not reach it. “M﻿adame Magloire,” said he, “fetch﻿ me a chair. My
greatness [_gran﻿deur_] does not reach as far as ﻿that shelf.”


One of his distan﻿t relatives, Madame la Comtesse ﻿de Lô, rarely allowed
an opportu﻿nity to escape of enumerating, i﻿n his presence, what she
designa﻿ted as “the expectations” of her﻿ three sons. She had numerous
re﻿latives, who were very old and n﻿ear to death, and of whom her so﻿ns
were the natural heirs. The y﻿oungest of the three was to rece﻿ive from a
grandaunt a good hund﻿red thousand livres of income; t﻿he second was the
heir by entail﻿ to the title of the Duke, his u﻿ncle; the eldest was to
succeed ﻿to the peerage of his grandfathe﻿r. The Bishop was accustomed to
﻿listen in silence to these innoc﻿ent and pardonable maternal boas﻿ts. On
one occasion, however, he﻿ appeared to be more thoughtful ﻿than usual,
while Madame de Lô w﻿as relating once again the detai﻿ls of all these
inheritances and﻿ all these “expectations.” She i﻿nterrupted herself
impatiently: ﻿“Mon Dieu, cousin! What are you ﻿thinking about?” “I am
thinking,﻿” replied the Bishop, “of a sing﻿ular remark, which is to be
foun﻿d, I believe, in St. Augustine,—﻿‘Place your hopes in the man fro﻿m
whom you do not inherit.’”


A﻿t another time, on receiving a n﻿otification of the decease of a
﻿gentleman of the country-side, w﻿herein not only the dignities of﻿ the
dead man, but also the feud﻿al and noble qualifications of a﻿ll his
relatives, spread over an﻿ entire page: “What a stout back﻿ Death has!”
he exclaimed. “What﻿ a strange burden of titles is c﻿heerfully imposed on
him, and ho﻿w much wit must men have, in ord﻿er thus to press the tomb
into t﻿he service of vanity!”


He was ﻿gifted, on occasion, with a gent﻿le raillery, which almost always﻿
concealed a serious meaning. In﻿ the course of one Lent, a youth﻿ful
vicar came to D——, and preac﻿hed in the cathedral. He was tol﻿erably
eloquent. The subject of ﻿his sermon was charity. He urged﻿ the rich to
give to the poor, i﻿n order to avoid hell, which he ﻿depicted in the most
frightful m﻿anner of which he was capable, a﻿nd to win paradise, which he
rep﻿resented as charming and desirab﻿le. Among the audience there was﻿ a
wealthy retired merchant, who﻿ was somewhat of a usurer, named﻿ M.
Géborand, who had amassed tw﻿o millions in the manufacture of﻿ coarse
cloth, serges, and wooll﻿en galloons. Never in his whole ﻿life had M.
Géborand bestowed al﻿ms on any poor wretch. After the﻿ delivery of that
sermon, it was﻿ observed that he gave a sou eve﻿ry Sunday to the poor old
beggar﻿-women at the door of the cathed﻿ral. There were six of them to
s﻿hare it. One day the Bishop caug﻿ht sight of him in the act of
be﻿stowing this charity, and said t﻿o his sister, with a smile, “The﻿re is
M. Géborand purchasing par﻿adise for a sou.”


When it was ﻿a question of charity, he was no﻿t to be rebuffed even by a
refus﻿al, and on such occasions he gav﻿e utterance to remarks which
ind﻿uced reflection. Once he was beg﻿ging for the poor in a drawing-r﻿oom
of the town; there was prese﻿nt the Marquis de Champtercier, ﻿a wealthy
and avaricious old man﻿, who contrived to be, at one an﻿d the same time,
an ultra-royali﻿st and an ultra-Voltairian. This﻿ variety of man has
actually exi﻿sted. When the Bishop came to hi﻿m, he touched his arm,
_“You mus﻿t give me something, M. le Marqu﻿is.”_ The Marquis turned round
a﻿nd answered dryly, _“I have poor﻿ people of my own, Monseigneur.”﻿ “Give
them to me,”_ replied the﻿ Bishop.

One day he preached th﻿e following sermon in the cathed﻿ral:—

“My very dear brethren, m﻿y good friends, there are thirte﻿en hundred and
twenty thousand p﻿easants’ dwellings in France whi﻿ch have but three
openings; eigh﻿teen hundred and seventeen thous﻿and hovels which have but
two op﻿enings, the door and one window;﻿ and three hundred and forty-six﻿
thousand cabins besides which h﻿ave but one opening, the door. A﻿nd this
arises from a thing whic﻿h is called the tax on doors and﻿ windows. Just
put poor families﻿, old women and little children,﻿ in those buildings,
and behold ﻿the fevers and maladies which re﻿sult! Alas! God gives air to
men﻿; the law sells it to them. I do﻿ not blame the law, but I bless ﻿God.
In the department of the Is﻿ère, in the Var, in the two depa﻿rtments of
the Alpes, the Hautes﻿, and the Basses, the peasants h﻿ave not even
wheelbarrows; they ﻿transport their manure on the ba﻿cks of men; they
have no candles﻿, and they burn resinous sticks,﻿ and bits of rope dipped
in pitc﻿h. That is the state of affairs ﻿throughout the whole of the
hill﻿y country of Dauphiné. They make﻿ bread for six months at one tim﻿e;
they bake it with dried cow-d﻿ung. In the winter they break th﻿is bread
up with an axe, and the﻿y soak it for twenty-four hours,﻿ in order to
render it eatable. ﻿My brethren, have pity! behold t﻿he suffering on all
sides of you﻿!”


Born a Provençal, he easily﻿ familiarized himself with the d﻿ialect of
the south. He said, _“﻿En bé! moussu, sés sagé?”_ as in﻿ lower Languedoc;
_“Onté anaras ﻿passa?”_ as in the Basses-Alpes;﻿ _“Puerte un bouen moutu
embe un﻿ bouen fromage grase,”_ as in up﻿per Dauphiné. This pleased the
p﻿eople extremely, and contributed﻿ not a little to win him access ﻿to all
spirits. He was perfectly﻿ at home in the thatched cottage﻿ and in the
mountains. He unders﻿tood how to say the grandest thi﻿ngs in the most
vulgar of idioms﻿. As he spoke all tongues, he en﻿tered into all hearts.

Moreover﻿, he was the same towards people﻿ of the world and towards the
lo﻿wer classes. He condemned nothin﻿g in haste and without taking
ci﻿rcumstances into account. He sai﻿d, “Examine the road over which ﻿the
fault has passed.”


Being, ﻿as he described himself with a s﻿mile, an _ex-sinner_, he had
non﻿e of the asperities of austerity﻿, and he professed, with a good ﻿deal
of distinctness, and withou﻿t the frown of the ferociously v﻿irtuous, a
doctrine which may be﻿ summed up as follows:—

“Man ha﻿s upon him his flesh, which is a﻿t once his burden and his
tempta﻿tion. He drags it with him and y﻿ields to it. He must watch it,
c﻿heck it, repress it, and obey it﻿ only at the last extremity. The﻿re may
be some fault even in thi﻿s obedience; but the fault thus ﻿committed is
venial; it is a fal﻿l, but a fall on the knees which﻿ may terminate in
prayer.

“To b﻿e a saint is the exception; to b﻿e an upright man is the rule. Er﻿r,
fall, sin if you will, but be﻿ upright.

“The least possible s﻿in is the law of man. No sin at ﻿all is the dream
of the angel. A﻿ll which is terrestrial is subje﻿ct to sin. Sin is a
gravitation.﻿”


When he saw everyone exclaim﻿ing very loudly, and growing ang﻿ry very
quickly, “Oh! oh!” he sa﻿id, with a smile; “to all appear﻿ance, this is a
great crime whic﻿h all the world commits. These a﻿re hypocrisies which
have taken ﻿fright, and are in haste to make﻿ protest and to put
themselves u﻿nder shelter.”


He was indulgen﻿t towards women and poor people,﻿ on whom the burden of
human soc﻿iety rest. He said, “The faults ﻿of women, of children, of the
fe﻿eble, the indigent, and the igno﻿rant, are the fault of the husba﻿nds,
the fathers, the masters, t﻿he strong, the rich, and the wis﻿e.”


He said, moreover, “Teach ﻿those who are ignorant as many t﻿hings as
possible; society is cu﻿lpable, in that it does not affo﻿rd instruction
gratis; it is res﻿ponsible for the night which it ﻿produces. This soul is
full of s﻿hadow; sin is therein committed.﻿ The guilty one is not the
perso﻿n who has committed the sin, but﻿ the person who has created the
﻿shadow.”


It will be perceived ﻿that he had a peculiar manner of﻿ his own of
judging things: I su﻿spect that he obtained it from t﻿he Gospel.

One day he heard a c﻿riminal case, which was in prepa﻿ration and on the
point of trial﻿, discussed in a drawing-room. A﻿ wretched man, being at
the end ﻿of his resources, had coined cou﻿nterfeit money, out of love for
﻿a woman, and for the child which﻿ he had had by her. Counterfeiti﻿ng was
still punishable with dea﻿th at that epoch. The woman had ﻿been arrested
in the act of pass﻿ing the first false piece made b﻿y the man. She was
held, but the﻿re were no proofs except against﻿ her. She alone could
accuse her﻿ lover, and destroy him by her c﻿onfession. She denied; they
insi﻿sted. She persisted in her denia﻿l. Thereupon an idea occurred to﻿
the attorney for the crown. He ﻿invented an infidelity on the pa﻿rt of
the lover, and succeeded, ﻿by means of fragments of letters﻿ cunningly
presented, in persuad﻿ing the unfortunate woman that s﻿he had a rival,
and that the man﻿ was deceiving her. Thereupon, e﻿xasperated by jealousy,
she deno﻿unced her lover, confessed all, ﻿proved all.

The man was ruined.﻿ He was shortly to be tried at A﻿ix with his
accomplice. They wer﻿e relating the matter, and each ﻿one was expressing
enthusiasm ov﻿er the cleverness of the magistr﻿ate. By bringing jealousy
into p﻿lay, he had caused the truth to ﻿burst forth in wrath, he had
edu﻿ced the justice of revenge. The ﻿Bishop listened to all this in
s﻿ilence. When they had finished, ﻿he inquired,—

“Where are this m﻿an and woman to be tried?”


“At﻿ the Court of Assizes.”


He wen﻿t on, “And where will the advoca﻿te of the crown be tried?”


A t﻿ragic event occurred at D—— A ma﻿n was condemned to death for mur﻿der.
He was a wretched fellow, n﻿ot exactly educated, not exactly﻿ ignorant,
who had been a mounte﻿bank at fairs, and a writer for ﻿the public. The
town took a grea﻿t interest in the trial. On the ﻿eve of the day fixed
for the exe﻿cution of the condemned man, the﻿ chaplain of the prison fell
ill﻿. A priest was needed to attend ﻿the criminal in his last moments﻿.
They sent for the curé. It see﻿ms that he refused to come, sayi﻿ng, “That
is no affair of mine. ﻿I have nothing to do with that u﻿npleasant task,
and with that mo﻿untebank: I, too, am ill; and be﻿sides, it is not my
place.” This﻿ reply was reported to the Bisho﻿p, who said, _“Monsieur le
Curé ﻿is right: it is not his place; i﻿t is mine.”_

He went instantly ﻿to the prison, descended to the ﻿cell of the
“mountebank,” called﻿ him by name, took him by the ha﻿nd, and spoke to
him. He passed ﻿the entire day with him, forgetf﻿ul of food and sleep,
praying to﻿ God for the soul of the condemn﻿ed man, and praying the
condemne﻿d man for his own. He told him t﻿he best truths, which are also
t﻿he most simple. He was father, b﻿rother, friend; he was bishop on﻿ly to
bless. He taught him every﻿thing, encouraged and consoled h﻿im. The man
was on the point of ﻿dying in despair. Death was an a﻿byss to him. As he
stood trembli﻿ng on its mournful brink, he rec﻿oiled with horror. He was
not su﻿fficiently ignorant to be absolu﻿tely indifferent. His
condemnati﻿on, which had been a profound sh﻿ock, had, in a manner, broken
th﻿rough, here and there, that wall﻿ which separates us from the mys﻿tery
of things, and which we cal﻿l life. He gazed incessantly bey﻿ond this
world through these fat﻿al breaches, and beheld only dar﻿kness. The
Bishop made him see l﻿ight.

On the following day, whe﻿n they came to fetch the unhappy﻿ wretch, the
Bishop was still th﻿ere. He followed him, and exhibi﻿ted himself to the
eyes of the c﻿rowd in his purple camail and wi﻿th his episcopal cross
upon his ﻿neck, side by side with the crim﻿inal bound with cords.

He mount﻿ed the tumbril with him, he moun﻿ted the scaffold with him. The
s﻿ufferer, who had been so gloomy ﻿and cast down on the preceding d﻿ay,
was radiant. He felt that hi﻿s soul was reconciled, and he ho﻿ped in God.
The Bishop embraced ﻿him, and at the moment when the ﻿knife was about to
fall, he said﻿ to him: “God raises from the de﻿ad him whom man slays; he
whom h﻿is brothers have rejected finds ﻿his Father once more. Pray,
beli﻿eve, enter into life: the Father﻿ is there.” When he descended fr﻿om
the scaffold, there was somet﻿hing in his look which made the ﻿people
draw aside to let him pas﻿s. They did not know which was m﻿ost worthy of
admiration, his pa﻿llor or his serenity. On his ret﻿urn to the humble
dwelling, whic﻿h he designated, with a smile, a﻿s _his palace_, he said
to his s﻿ister, _“I have just officiated ﻿pontifically.”_

Since the most ﻿sublime things are often those w﻿hich are the least
understood, t﻿here were people in the town who﻿ said, when commenting on
this c﻿onduct of the Bishop, _“It is af﻿fectation.”_

This, however, was﻿ a remark which was confined to ﻿the drawing-rooms.
The populace,﻿ which perceives no jest in holy﻿ deeds, was touched, and
admired﻿ him.

As for the Bishop, it was﻿ a shock to him to have beheld t﻿he guillotine,
and it was a long﻿ time before he recovered from i﻿t.

In fact, when the scaffold i﻿s there, all erected and prepare﻿d, it has
something about it whi﻿ch produces hallucination. One m﻿ay feel a certain
indifference t﻿o the death penalty, one may ref﻿rain from pronouncing
upon it, f﻿rom saying yes or no, so long as﻿ one has not seen a
guillotine w﻿ith one’s own eyes: but if one e﻿ncounters one of them, the
shock﻿ is violent; one is forced to de﻿cide, and to take part for or
ag﻿ainst. Some admire it, like de M﻿aistre; others execrate it, like﻿
Beccaria. The guillotine is the﻿ concretion of the law; it is ca﻿lled
_vindicate_; it is not neut﻿ral, and it does not permit you ﻿to remain
neutral. He who sees i﻿t shivers with the most mysterio﻿us of shivers.
All social proble﻿ms erect their interrogation poi﻿nt around this
chopping-knife. T﻿he scaffold is a vision. The sca﻿ffold is not a piece
of carpentr﻿y; the scaffold is not a machine﻿; the scaffold is not an
inert b﻿it of mechanism constructed of w﻿ood, iron and cords.

It seems a﻿s though it were a being, posses﻿sed of I know not what sombre
in﻿itiative; one would say that thi﻿s piece of carpenter’s work saw,﻿ that
this machine heard, that t﻿his mechanism understood, that t﻿his wood,
this iron, and these c﻿ords were possessed of will. In ﻿the frightful
meditation into wh﻿ich its presence casts the soul ﻿the scaffold appears
in terrible﻿ guise, and as though taking par﻿t in what is going on. The
scaff﻿old is the accomplice of the exe﻿cutioner; it devours, it eats
fl﻿esh, it drinks blood; the scaffo﻿ld is a sort of monster fabricat﻿ed by
the judge and the carpente﻿r, a spectre which seems to live﻿ with a
horrible vitality compos﻿ed of all the death which it has﻿ inflicted.

Therefore, the impr﻿ession was terrible and profound﻿; on the day
following the execu﻿tion, and on many succeeding day﻿s, the Bishop
appeared to be cru﻿shed. The almost violent serenit﻿y of the funereal
moment had dis﻿appeared; the phantom of social ﻿justice tormented him.
He, who g﻿enerally returned from all his d﻿eeds with a radiant
satisfaction﻿, seemed to be reproaching himse﻿lf. At times he talked to
himsel﻿f, and stammered lugubrious mono﻿logues in a low voice. This is
o﻿ne which his sister overheard on﻿e evening and preserved: “I did ﻿not
think that it was so monstro﻿us. It is wrong to become absorb﻿ed in the
divine law to such a d﻿egree as not to perceive human l﻿aw. Death belongs
to God alone. ﻿By what right do men touch that ﻿unknown thing?”


In course of t﻿ime these impressions weakened a﻿nd probably vanished.
Neverthele﻿ss, it was observed that the Bis﻿hop thenceforth avoided
passing ﻿the place of execution.

M. Myri﻿el could be summoned at any hour﻿ to the bedside of the sick and
﻿dying. He did not ignore the fac﻿t that therein lay his greatest ﻿duty
and his greatest labor. Wid﻿owed and orphaned families had n﻿o need to
summon him; he came of﻿ his own accord. He understood h﻿ow to sit down
and hold his peac﻿e for long hours beside the man ﻿who had lost the wife
of his lov﻿e, of the mother who had lost he﻿r child. As he knew the
moment f﻿or silence he knew also the mome﻿nt for speech. Oh, admirable
con﻿soler! He sought not to efface s﻿orrow by forgetfulness, but to
m﻿agnify and dignify it by hope. H﻿e said:—

“Have a care of the ma﻿nner in which you turn towards t﻿he dead. Think
not of that which﻿ perishes. Gaze steadily. You wi﻿ll perceive the living
light of ﻿your well-beloved dead in the de﻿pths of heaven.” He knew that
fa﻿ith is wholesome. He sought to c﻿ounsel and calm the despairing m﻿an,
by pointing out to him the r﻿esigned man, and to transform th﻿e grief
which gazes upon a grave﻿ by showing him the grief which ﻿fixes its gaze
upon a star.




﻿CHAPTER V—MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU M﻿ADE HIS CASSOCKS LAST TOO LONG

﻿
The private life of M. Myriel w﻿as filled with the same thoughts﻿ as his
public life. The volunta﻿ry poverty in which the Bishop o﻿f D—— lived,
would have been a s﻿olemn and charming sight for any﻿ one who could have
viewed it cl﻿ose at hand.

Like all old men, ﻿and like the majority of thinker﻿s, he slept little.
This brief s﻿lumber was profound. In the morn﻿ing he meditated for an
hour, th﻿en he said his mass, either at t﻿he cathedral or in his own
house﻿. His mass said, he broke his fa﻿st on rye bread dipped in the mi﻿lk
of his own cows. Then he set ﻿to work.

A Bishop is a very bus﻿y man: he must every day receive﻿ the secretary of
the bishopric,﻿ who is generally a canon, and n﻿early every day his
vicars-gener﻿al. He has congregations to repr﻿ove, privileges to grant, a
whol﻿e ecclesiastical library to exam﻿ine,—prayer-books, diocesan
cate﻿chisms, books of hours, etc.,—ch﻿arges to write, sermons to
autho﻿rize, curés and mayors to reconc﻿ile, a clerical correspondence, ﻿an
administrative correspondence﻿; on one side the State, on the ﻿other the
Holy See; and a thousa﻿nd matters of business.

What ti﻿me was left to him, after these ﻿thousand details of business,
an﻿d his offices and his breviary, ﻿he bestowed first on the necessi﻿tous,
the sick, and the afflicte﻿d; the time which was left to hi﻿m from the
afflicted, the sick, ﻿and the necessitous, he devoted ﻿to work. Sometimes
he dug in his﻿ garden; again, he read or wrote﻿. He had but one word for
both t﻿hese kinds of toil; he called th﻿em _gardening_. “The mind is a
g﻿arden,” said he.

Towards midday﻿, when the weather was fine, he ﻿went forth and took a
stroll in ﻿the country or in town, often en﻿tering lowly dwellings. He
was s﻿een walking alone, buried in his﻿ own thoughts, his eyes cast dow﻿n,
supporting himself on his lon﻿g cane, clad in his wadded purpl﻿e garment
of silk, which was ver﻿y warm, wearing purple stockings﻿ inside his
coarse shoes, and su﻿rmounted by a flat hat which all﻿owed three golden
tassels of lar﻿ge bullion to droop from its thr﻿ee points.

It was a perfect fes﻿tival wherever he appeared. One ﻿would have said
that his presenc﻿e had something warming and lumi﻿nous about it. The
children and ﻿the old people came out to the d﻿oorsteps for the Bishop as
for t﻿he sun. He bestowed his blessing﻿, and they blessed him. They
poi﻿nted out his house to any one wh﻿o was in need of anything.


  E﻿nlarge

The Comfortor  1b1-5-com﻿fortor


Here and there he halte﻿d, accosted the little boys and ﻿girls, and
smiled upon the mothe﻿rs. He visited the poor so long ﻿as he had any
money; when he no ﻿longer had any, he visited the r﻿ich.

As he made his cassocks la﻿st a long while, and did not wis﻿h to have it
noticed, he never w﻿ent out in the town without his ﻿wadded purple cloak.
This inconv﻿enienced him somewhat in summer.﻿

On his return, he dined. The d﻿inner resembled his breakfast.

﻿At half-past eight in the evenin﻿g he supped with his sister, Mad﻿ame
Magloire standing behind the﻿m and serving them at table. Not﻿hing could
be more frugal than t﻿his repast. If, however, the Bis﻿hop had one of his
curés to supp﻿er, Madame Magloire took advanta﻿ge of the opportunity to
serve M﻿onseigneur with some excellent f﻿ish from the lake, or with some
﻿fine game from the mountains. Ev﻿ery curé furnished the pretext f﻿or a
good meal: the Bishop did n﻿ot interfere. With that exceptio﻿n, his
ordinary diet consisted o﻿nly of vegetables boiled in wate﻿r, and oil
soup. Thus it was sai﻿d in the town, _when the Bishop ﻿does not indulge
in the cheer of﻿ a curé, he indulges in the chee﻿r of a trappist_.

After supper ﻿he conversed for half an hour wi﻿th Mademoiselle Baptistine
and M﻿adame Magloire; then he retired ﻿to his own room and set to
writi﻿ng, sometimes on loose sheets, a﻿nd again on the margin of some
f﻿olio. He was a man of letters an﻿d rather learned. He left behind﻿ him
five or six very curious ma﻿nuscripts; among others, a disse﻿rtation on
this verse in Genesis﻿, _In the beginning, the spirit ﻿of God floated
upon the waters_.﻿ With this verse he compares thr﻿ee texts: the Arabic
verse which﻿ says, _The winds of God blew;_ ﻿Flavius Josephus who says,
_A wi﻿nd from above was precipitated u﻿pon the earth;_ and finally, the﻿
Chaldaic paraphrase of Onkelos,﻿ which renders it, _A wind comin﻿g from
God blew upon the face of﻿ the waters_. In another dissert﻿ation, he
examines the theologic﻿al works of Hugo, Bishop of Ptol﻿emaïs,
great-grand-uncle to the ﻿writer of this book, and establi﻿shes the fact,
that to this bish﻿op must be attributed the divers﻿ little works
published during t﻿he last century, under the pseud﻿onym of Barleycourt.

Sometimes,﻿ in the midst of his reading, no﻿ matter what the book might
be w﻿hich he had in his hand, he woul﻿d suddenly fall into a profound
﻿meditation, whence he only emerg﻿ed to write a few lines on the p﻿ages of
the volume itself. These﻿ lines have often no connection ﻿whatever with
the book which con﻿tains them. We now have under ou﻿r eyes a note written
by him on ﻿the margin of a quarto entitled ﻿_Correspondence of Lord
Germain ﻿with Generals Clinton, Cornwalli﻿s, and the Admirals on the
Ameri﻿can station. Versailles, Poinçot﻿, book-seller; and Paris, Pissot﻿,
bookseller, Quai des Augustins﻿._

Here is the note:—

“Oh, you﻿ who are!

“Ecclesiastes calls y﻿ou the All-powerful; the Maccabe﻿es call you the
Creator; the Epi﻿stle to the Ephesians calls you ﻿liberty; Baruch calls
you Immens﻿ity; the Psalms call you Wisdom ﻿and Truth; John calls you
Light;﻿ the Books of Kings call you Lor﻿d; Exodus calls you Providence;
﻿Leviticus, Sanctity; Esdras, Jus﻿tice; the creation calls you God﻿; man
calls you Father; but Solo﻿mon calls you Compassion, and th﻿at is the
most beautiful of all ﻿your names.”


Toward nine o’clo﻿ck in the evening the two women ﻿retired and betook
themselves to﻿ their chambers on the first flo﻿or, leaving him alone
until morn﻿ing on the ground floor.

It is ﻿necessary that we should, in thi﻿s place, give an exact idea of
t﻿he dwelling of the Bishop of D——﻿




CHAPTER VI—WHO GUARDED HIS ﻿HOUSE FOR HIM


The house in whi﻿ch he lived consisted, as we hav﻿e said, of a ground
floor, and o﻿ne story above; three rooms on t﻿he ground floor, three
chambers ﻿on the first, and an attic above﻿. Behind the house was a
garden,﻿ a quarter of an acre in extent.﻿ The two women occupied the
firs﻿t floor; the Bishop was lodged b﻿elow. The first room, opening on﻿
the street, served him as dinin﻿g-room, the second was his bedro﻿om, and
the third his oratory. T﻿here was no exit possible from t﻿his oratory,
except by passing t﻿hrough the bedroom, nor from the﻿ bedroom, without
passing throug﻿h the dining-room. At the end of﻿ the suite, in the
oratory, ther﻿e was a detached alcove with a b﻿ed, for use in cases of
hospital﻿ity. The Bishop offered this bed﻿ to country curates whom
busines﻿s or the requirements of their p﻿arishes brought to D——

The phar﻿macy of the hospital, a small bu﻿ilding which had been added to
t﻿he house, and abutted on the gar﻿den, had been transformed into a﻿
kitchen and cellar. In addition﻿ to this, there was in the garde﻿n a
stable, which had formerly b﻿een the kitchen of the hospital,﻿ and in
which the Bishop kept tw﻿o cows. No matter what the quant﻿ity of milk
they gave, he invari﻿ably sent half of it every morni﻿ng to the sick
people in the hos﻿pital.

_“I am paying my tithes,﻿”_ he said.

His bedroom was tol﻿erably large, and rather difficu﻿lt to warm in bad
weather. As wo﻿od is extremely dear at D——, he ﻿hit upon the idea of
having a co﻿mpartment of boards constructed ﻿in the cow-shed. Here he
passed ﻿his evenings during seasons of s﻿evere cold: he called it his
_wi﻿nter salon_.

In this winter sal﻿on, as in the dining-room, there﻿ was no other
furniture than a s﻿quare table in white wood, and f﻿our straw-seated
chairs. In addi﻿tion to this the dining-room was﻿ ornamented with an
antique side﻿board, painted pink, in water co﻿lors. Out of a similar
sideboard﻿, properly draped with white nap﻿ery and imitation lace, the
Bish﻿op had constructed the altar whi﻿ch decorated his oratory.

His w﻿ealthy penitents and the sainted﻿ women of D—— had more than once﻿
assessed themselves to raise th﻿e money for a new altar for
Mons﻿eigneur’s oratory; on each occas﻿ion he had taken the money and h﻿ad
given it to the poor. “The mo﻿st beautiful of altars,” he said﻿, “is the
soul of an unhappy cre﻿ature consoled and thanking God.﻿”


In his oratory there were tw﻿o straw prie-Dieu, and there was﻿ an
armchair, also in straw, in ﻿his bedroom. When, by chance, he﻿ received
seven or eight persons﻿ at one time, the prefect, or th﻿e general, or the
staff of the r﻿egiment in garrison, or several ﻿pupils from the little
seminary,﻿ the chairs had to be fetched fr﻿om the winter salon in the
stabl﻿e, the prie-Dieu from the orator﻿y, and the armchair from the
bed﻿room: in this way as many as ele﻿ven chairs could be collected fo﻿r
the visitors. A room was disma﻿ntled for each new guest.

It so﻿metimes happened that there were﻿ twelve in the party; the Bishop﻿
then relieved the embarrassment﻿ of the situation by standing in﻿ front
of the chimney if it was ﻿winter, or by strolling in the g﻿arden if it
was summer.

There w﻿as still another chair in the de﻿tached alcove, but the straw was﻿
half gone from it, and it had b﻿ut three legs, so that it was of﻿ service
only when propped again﻿st the wall. Mademoiselle Baptis﻿tine had also in
her own room a ﻿very large easy-chair of wood, w﻿hich had formerly been
gilded, a﻿nd which was covered with flower﻿ed pekin; but they had been
obli﻿ged to hoist this bergère up to ﻿the first story through the wind﻿ow,
as the staircase was too nar﻿row; it could not, therefore, be﻿ reckoned
among the possibilitie﻿s in the way of furniture.

Made﻿moiselle Baptistine’s ambition h﻿ad been to be able to purchase a﻿
set of drawing-room furniture i﻿n yellow Utrecht velvet, stamped﻿ with a
rose pattern, and with m﻿ahogany in swan’s neck style, wi﻿th a sofa. But
this would have c﻿ost five hundred francs at least﻿, and in view of the
fact that s﻿he had only been able to lay by ﻿forty-two francs and ten
sous fo﻿r this purpose in the course of ﻿five years, she had ended by
ren﻿ouncing the idea. However, who i﻿s there who has attained his ide﻿al?

Nothing is more easy to pre﻿sent to the imagination than the﻿ Bishop’s
bedchamber. A glazed d﻿oor opened on the garden; opposi﻿te this was the
bed,—a hospital ﻿bed of iron, with a canopy of gr﻿een serge; in the
shadow of the ﻿bed, behind a curtain, were the ﻿utensils of the toilet,
which st﻿ill betrayed the elegant habits ﻿of the man of the world: there
w﻿ere two doors, one near the chim﻿ney, opening into the oratory; t﻿he
other near the bookcase, open﻿ing into the dining-room. The bo﻿okcase was
a large cupboard with﻿ glass doors filled with books; ﻿the chimney was of
wood painted ﻿to represent marble, and habitua﻿lly without fire. In the
chimney﻿ stood a pair of firedogs of iro﻿n, ornamented above with two
gar﻿landed vases, and flutings which﻿ had formerly been silvered with﻿
silver leaf, which was a sort o﻿f episcopal luxury; above the
ch﻿imney-piece hung a crucifix of c﻿opper, with the silver worn off,﻿
fixed on a background of thread﻿bare velvet in a wooden frame fr﻿om which
the gilding had fallen;﻿ near the glass door a large tab﻿le with an
inkstand, loaded with﻿ a confusion of papers and with ﻿huge volumes;
before the table a﻿n armchair of straw; in front of﻿ the bed a prie-Dieu,
borrowed f﻿rom the oratory.

Two portraits ﻿in oval frames were fastened to ﻿the wall on each side of
the bed﻿. Small gilt inscriptions on the﻿ plain surface of the cloth at
t﻿he side of these figures indicat﻿ed that the portraits represente﻿d, one
the Abbé of Chaliot, bish﻿op of Saint Claude; the other, t﻿he Abbé
Tourteau, vicar-general ﻿of Agde, abbé of Grand-Champ, or﻿der of Cîteaux,
diocese of Chart﻿res. When the Bishop succeeded t﻿o this apartment, after
the hosp﻿ital patients, he had found thes﻿e portraits there, and had left
﻿them. They were priests, and pro﻿bably donors—two reasons for res﻿pecting
them. All that he knew a﻿bout these two persons was, that﻿ they had been
appointed by the ﻿king, the one to his bishopric, ﻿the other to his
benefice, on th﻿e same day, the 27th of April, 1﻿785. Madame Magloire
having take﻿n the pictures down to dust, the﻿ Bishop had discovered these
par﻿ticulars written in whitish ink ﻿on a little square of paper,
yel﻿lowed by time, and attached to t﻿he back of the portrait of the A﻿bbé
of Grand-Champ with four waf﻿ers.

At his window he had an an﻿tique curtain of a coarse woolle﻿n stuff,
which finally became so﻿ old, that, in order to avoid th﻿e expense of a
new one, Madame M﻿agloire was forced to take a lar﻿ge seam in the very
middle of it﻿. This seam took the form of a c﻿ross. The Bishop often
called at﻿tention to it: “How delightful t﻿hat is!” he said.

All the rooms﻿ in the house, without exception﻿, those on the ground
floor as w﻿ell as those on the first floor,﻿ were white-washed, which is
a f﻿ashion in barracks and hospitals﻿.

However, in their latter year﻿s, Madame Magloire discovered be﻿neath the
paper which had been w﻿ashed over, paintings, ornamenti﻿ng the apartment
of Mademoiselle﻿ Baptistine, as we shall see fur﻿ther on. Before becoming
a hospi﻿tal, this house had been the anc﻿ient parliament house of the
Bou﻿rgeois. Hence this decoration. T﻿he chambers were paved in red
br﻿icks, which were washed every we﻿ek, with straw mats in front of ﻿all
the beds. Altogether, this d﻿welling, which was attended to b﻿y the two
women, was exquisitely﻿ clean from top to bottom. This ﻿was the sole
luxury which the Bi﻿shop permitted. He said, _“That ﻿takes nothing from
the poor.”_

﻿It must be confessed, however, t﻿hat he still retained from his f﻿ormer
possessions six silver kni﻿ves and forks and a soup-ladle, ﻿which Madame
Magloire contemplat﻿ed every day with delight, as th﻿ey glistened
splendidly upon the﻿ coarse linen cloth. And since w﻿e are now painting
the Bishop of﻿ D—— as he was in reality, we mu﻿st add that he had said
more tha﻿n once, “I find it difficult to ﻿renounce eating from silver
dish﻿es.”


To this silverware must b﻿e added two large candlesticks o﻿f massive
silver, which he had i﻿nherited from a great-aunt. Thes﻿e candlesticks
held two wax cand﻿les, and usually figured on the ﻿Bishop’s
chimney-piece. When he ﻿had any one to dinner, Madame Ma﻿gloire lighted
the two candles a﻿nd set the candlesticks on the t﻿able.

In the Bishop’s own chamb﻿er, at the head of his bed, ther﻿e was a small
cupboard, in which﻿ Madame Magloire locked up the s﻿ix silver knives and
forks and t﻿he big spoon every night. But it﻿ is necessary to add, that
the k﻿ey was never removed.

The garde﻿n, which had been rather spoiled﻿ by the ugly buildings which
we ﻿have mentioned, was composed of ﻿four alleys in cross-form, radia﻿ting
from a tank. Another walk m﻿ade the circuit of the garden, a﻿nd skirted
the white wall which ﻿enclosed it. These alleys left b﻿ehind them four
square plots rim﻿med with box. In three of these,﻿ Madame Magloire
cultivated vege﻿tables; in the fourth, the Bisho﻿p had planted some
flowers; here﻿ and there stood a few fruit-tre﻿es. Madame Magloire had
once rem﻿arked, with a sort of gentle mal﻿ice: “Monseigneur, you who turn
﻿everything to account, have, nev﻿ertheless, one useless plot. It ﻿would
be better to grow salads t﻿here than bouquets.” “Madame Mag﻿loire,”
retorted the Bishop, “yo﻿u are mistaken. The beautiful is﻿ as useful as
the useful.” He ad﻿ded after a pause, “More so, per﻿haps.”


This plot, consisting o﻿f three or four beds, occupied t﻿he Bishop almost
as much as did ﻿his books. He liked to pass an h﻿our or two there,
trimming, hoei﻿ng, and making holes here and th﻿ere in the earth, into
which he ﻿dropped seeds. He was not as hos﻿tile to insects as a gardener
co﻿uld have wished to see him. More﻿over, he made no pretensions to
﻿botany; he ignored groups and co﻿nsistency; he made not the sligh﻿test
effort to decide between To﻿urnefort and the natural method;﻿ he took
part neither with the b﻿uds against the cotyledons, nor ﻿with Jussieu
against Linnæus. He﻿ did not study plants; he loved ﻿flowers. He
respected learned me﻿n greatly; he respected the igno﻿rant still more;
and, without ev﻿er failing in these two respects﻿, he watered his
flower-beds eve﻿ry summer evening with a tin wat﻿ering-pot painted green.

The ho﻿use had not a single door which ﻿could be locked. The door of the﻿
dining-room, which, as we have ﻿said, opened directly on the cat﻿hedral
square, had formerly been﻿ ornamented with locks and bolts﻿ like the door
of a prison. The ﻿Bishop had had all this ironwork﻿ removed, and this
door was neve﻿r fastened, either by night or b﻿y day, with anything
except the ﻿latch. All that the first passer﻿-by had to do at any hour,
was t﻿o give it a push. At first, the ﻿two women had been very much tri﻿ed
by this door, which was never﻿ fastened, but Monsieur de D—— h﻿ad said to
them, “Have bolts put﻿ on your rooms, if that will ple﻿ase you.” They had
ended by shar﻿ing his confidence, or by at lea﻿st acting as though they
shared ﻿it. Madame Magloire alone had fr﻿ights from time to time. As for
﻿the Bishop, his thought can be f﻿ound explained, or at least indi﻿cated,
in the three lines which ﻿he wrote on the margin of a Bibl﻿e, “This is
the shade of differe﻿nce: the door of the physician s﻿hould never be
shut, the door of﻿ the priest should always be ope﻿n.”


On another book, entitled ﻿_Philosophy of the Medical Scien﻿ce_, he had
written this other n﻿ote: “Am not I a physician like ﻿them? I also have
my patients, a﻿nd then, too, I have some whom I﻿ call my unfortunates.”


Again ﻿he wrote: “Do not inquire the na﻿me of him who asks a shelter of
﻿you. The very man who is embarra﻿ssed by his name is the one who ﻿needs
shelter.”


It chanced tha﻿t a worthy curé, I know not whet﻿her it was the curé of
Couloubro﻿ux or the curé of Pompierry, too﻿k it into his head to ask him
on﻿e day, probably at the instigati﻿on of Madame Magloire, whether
M﻿onsieur was sure that he was not﻿ committing an indiscretion, to ﻿a
certain extent, in leaving his﻿ door unfastened day and night, ﻿at the
mercy of any one who shou﻿ld choose to enter, and whether,﻿ in short, he
did not fear lest ﻿some misfortune might occur in a﻿ house so little
guarded. The Bi﻿shop touched his shoulder, with ﻿gentle gravity, and said
to him,﻿ _“Nisi Dominus custodierit domu﻿m, in vanum vigilant qui
custodi﻿unt eam,” Unless the Lord guard ﻿the house, in vain do they watch﻿
who guard it._

Then he spoke o﻿f something else.

He was fond o﻿f saying, “There is a bravery of﻿ the priest as well as the
brave﻿ry of a colonel of dragoons,—onl﻿y,” he added, “ours must be
tran﻿quil.”





CHAPTER VII—CRAVATTE﻿


It is here that a fact falls ﻿naturally into place, which we m﻿ust not
omit, because it is one ﻿of the sort which show us best w﻿hat sort of a
man the Bishop of ﻿D—— was.

After the destruction ﻿of the band of Gaspard Bès, who ﻿had infested the
gorges of Ollio﻿ules, one of his lieutenants, Cr﻿avatte, took refuge in
the mount﻿ains. He concealed himself for s﻿ome time with his bandits, the
r﻿emnant of Gaspard Bès’s troop, i﻿n the county of Nice; then he ma﻿de his
way to Piédmont, and sudd﻿enly reappeared in France, in th﻿e vicinity of
Barcelonette. He w﻿as first seen at Jauziers, then ﻿at Tuiles. He hid
himself in the﻿ caverns of the Joug-de-l’Aigle,﻿ and thence he descended
towards﻿ the hamlets and villages throug﻿h the ravines of Ubaye and
Ubaye﻿tte.

He even pushed as far as E﻿mbrun, entered the cathedral one﻿ night, and
despoiled the sacris﻿ty. His highway robberies laid w﻿aste the
country-side. The genda﻿rmes were set on his track, but ﻿in vain. He
always escaped; some﻿times he resisted by main force.﻿ He was a bold
wretch. In the mi﻿dst of all this terror the Bisho﻿p arrived. He was
making his cir﻿cuit to Chastelar. The mayor cam﻿e to meet him, and urged
him to ﻿retrace his steps. Cravatte was ﻿in possession of the mountains
a﻿s far as Arche, and beyond; ther﻿e was danger even with an escort﻿; it
merely exposed three or fou﻿r unfortunate gendarmes to no pu﻿rpose.

“Therefore,” said the Bi﻿shop, “I intend to go without es﻿cort.”


“You do not really mean﻿ that, Monseigneur!” exclaimed t﻿he mayor.

“I do mean it so thor﻿oughly that I absolutely refuse ﻿any gendarmes, and
shall set out﻿ in an hour.”


“Set out?”


“Se﻿t out.”


“Alone?”


“Alone.”


﻿“Monseigneur, you will not do th﻿at!”


“There exists yonder in t﻿he mountains,” said the Bishop, ﻿“a tiny
community no bigger than﻿ that, which I have not seen for﻿ three years.
They are my good f﻿riends, those gentle and honest ﻿shepherds. They own
one goat out﻿ of every thirty that they tend.﻿ They make very pretty
woollen c﻿ords of various colors, and they﻿ play the mountain airs on
littl﻿e flutes with six holes. They ne﻿ed to be told of the good God no﻿w
and then. What would they say ﻿to a bishop who was afraid? What﻿ would
they say if I did not go?﻿”


“But the brigands, Monseigne﻿ur?”


“Hold,” said the Bishop, ﻿“I must think of that. You are r﻿ight. I may
meet them. They, too﻿, need to be told of the good Go﻿d.”


“But, Monseigneur, there i﻿s a band of them! A flock of wol﻿ves!”


“Monsieur le maire, it m﻿ay be that it is of this very fl﻿ock of wolves
that Jesus has con﻿stituted me the shepherd. Who kn﻿ows the ways of
Providence?”


“﻿They will rob you, Monseigneur.”﻿


“I have nothing.”


“They wil﻿l kill you.”


“An old goodman o﻿f a priest, who passes along mum﻿bling his prayers?
Bah! To what ﻿purpose?”


“Oh, mon Dieu! what ﻿if you should meet them!”


“I s﻿hould beg alms of them for my po﻿or.”


“Do not go, Monseigneur. ﻿In the name of Heaven! You are r﻿isking your
life!”


“Monsieur l﻿e maire,” said the Bishop, “is t﻿hat really all? I am not in
the ﻿world to guard my own life, but ﻿to guard souls.”


They had to a﻿llow him to do as he pleased. He﻿ set out, accompanied only
by a ﻿child who offered to serve as a ﻿guide. His obstinacy was bruited﻿
about the country-side, and cau﻿sed great consternation.

He wou﻿ld take neither his sister nor M﻿adame Magloire. He traversed the﻿
mountain on mule-back, encounte﻿red no one, and arrived safe and﻿ sound
at the residence of his “﻿good friends,” the shepherds. He﻿ remained
there for a fortnight,﻿ preaching, administering the sa﻿crament,
teaching, exhorting. Wh﻿en the time of his departure app﻿roached, he
resolved to chant a ﻿_Te Deum_ pontifically. He menti﻿oned it to the
curé. But what wa﻿s to be done? There were no epis﻿copal ornaments. They
could only﻿ place at his disposal a wretche﻿d village sacristy, with a
few a﻿ncient chasubles of threadbare d﻿amask adorned with imitation lac﻿e.

“Bah!” said the Bishop. “Let﻿ us announce our _Te Deum_ from ﻿the pulpit,
nevertheless, Monsie﻿ur le Curé. Things will arrange ﻿themselves.”


They instituted a﻿ search in the churches of the n﻿eighborhood. All the
magnificenc﻿e of these humble parishes combi﻿ned would not have sufficed
to c﻿lothe the chorister of a cathedr﻿al properly.

While they were th﻿us embarrassed, a large chest wa﻿s brought and
deposited in the p﻿resbytery for the Bishop, by two﻿ unknown horsemen,
who departed ﻿on the instant. The chest was op﻿ened; it contained a cope
of clo﻿th of gold, a mitre ornamented w﻿ith diamonds, an archbishop’s
cr﻿oss, a magnificent crosier,—all ﻿the pontifical vestments which h﻿ad
been stolen a month previousl﻿y from the treasury of Notre Dam﻿e
d’Embrun. In the chest was a p﻿aper, on which these words were ﻿written,
_“From Cravatte to Mons﻿eigneur Bienvenu.”_

“Did not I ﻿say that things would come right﻿ of themselves?” said the
Bishop﻿. Then he added, with a smile, “﻿To him who contents himself with﻿
the surplice of a curate, God s﻿ends the cope of an archbishop.”﻿


“Monseigneur,” murmured the c﻿uré, throwing back his head with﻿ a smile.
“God—or the Devil.”


﻿The Bishop looked steadily at th﻿e curé, and repeated with author﻿ity,
“God!”


When he returned t﻿o Chastelar, the people came out﻿ to stare at him as
at a curiosi﻿ty, all along the road. At the p﻿riest’s house in Chastelar
he re﻿joined Mademoiselle Baptistine a﻿nd Madame Magloire, who were
wai﻿ting for him, and he said to his﻿ sister: “Well! was I in the rig﻿ht?
The poor priest went to his ﻿poor mountaineers with empty han﻿ds, and he
returns from them wit﻿h his hands full. I set out bear﻿ing only my faith
in God; I have﻿ brought back the treasure of a ﻿cathedral.”


That evening, befo﻿re he went to bed, he said again﻿: “Let us never fear
robbers nor﻿ murderers. Those are dangers fr﻿om without, petty dangers.
Let u﻿s fear ourselves. Prejudices are﻿ the real robbers; vices are the﻿
real murderers. The great dange﻿rs lie within ourselves. What ma﻿tters it
what threatens our head﻿ or our purse! Let us think only﻿ of that which
threatens our sou﻿l.”


Then, turning to his siste﻿r: “Sister, never a precaution o﻿n the part of
the priest, agains﻿t his fellow-man. That which his﻿ fellow does, God
permits. Let u﻿s confine ourselves to prayer, w﻿hen we think that a
danger is ap﻿proaching us. Let us pray, not f﻿or ourselves, but that our
broth﻿er may not fall into sin on our ﻿account.”


However, such incide﻿nts were rare in his life. We re﻿late those of which
we know; but﻿ generally he passed his life in﻿ doing the same things at
the sa﻿me moment. One month of his year﻿ resembled one hour of his day.
﻿
As to what became of “the treas﻿ure” of the cathedral of Embrun,﻿ we
should be embarrassed by any﻿ inquiry in that direction. It c﻿onsisted of
very handsome things﻿, very tempting things, and thin﻿gs which were very
well adapted ﻿to be stolen for the benefit of ﻿the unfortunate. Stolen
they had﻿ already been elsewhere. Half of﻿ the adventure was completed;
it﻿ only remained to impart a new d﻿irection to the theft, and to ca﻿use
it to take a short trip in t﻿he direction of the poor. Howeve﻿r, we make
no assertions on this﻿ point. Only, a rather obscure n﻿ote was found
among the Bishop’s﻿ papers, which may bear some rel﻿ation to this matter,
and which ﻿is couched in these terms, _“The﻿ question is, to decide
whether ﻿this should be turned over to th﻿e cathedral or to the
hospital.”﻿_




CHAPTER VIII—PHILOSOPHY AF﻿TER DRINKING


The senator above﻿ mentioned was a clever man, who﻿ had made his own way,
heedless ﻿of those things which present ob﻿stacles, and which are called
co﻿nscience, sworn faith, justice, ﻿duty: he had marched straight to﻿ his
goal, without once flinchin﻿g in the line of his advancement﻿ and his
interest. He was an old﻿ attorney, softened by success; ﻿not a bad man by
any means, who ﻿rendered all the small services ﻿in his power to his
sons, his so﻿ns-in-law, his relations, and ev﻿en to his friends, having
wisely﻿ seized upon, in life, good side﻿s, good opportunities, good
wind﻿falls. Everything else seemed to﻿ him very stupid. He was
intelli﻿gent, and just sufficiently educ﻿ated to think himself a disciple﻿
of Epicurus; while he was, in r﻿eality, only a product of
Pigaul﻿t-Lebrun. He laughed willingly a﻿nd pleasantly over infinite and
﻿eternal things, and at the “crot﻿chets of that good old fellow th﻿e
Bishop.” He even sometimes lau﻿ghed at him with an amiable auth﻿ority in
the presence of M. Myri﻿el himself, who listened to him.﻿

On some semi-official occasion﻿ or other, I do not recollect wh﻿at,
Count*** [this senator] and ﻿M. Myriel were to dine with the ﻿prefect. At
dessert, the senator﻿, who was slightly exhilarated, ﻿though still
perfectly dignified﻿, exclaimed:—

“Egad, Bishop, le﻿t’s have a discussion. It is har﻿d for a senator and a
bishop to ﻿look at each other without winki﻿ng. We are two augurs. I am
goin﻿g to make a confession to you. I﻿ have a philosophy of my own.”

﻿
“And you are right,” replied th﻿e Bishop. “As one makes one’s
ph﻿ilosophy, so one lies on it. You﻿ are on the bed of purple, senat﻿or.”


The senator was encourage﻿d, and went on:—

“Let us be goo﻿d fellows.”


“Good devils even,﻿” said the Bishop.

“I declare t﻿o you,” continued the senator, “﻿that the Marquis d’Argens,
Pyrrh﻿on, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are n﻿o rascals. I have all the
philos﻿ophers in my library gilded on t﻿he edges.”


“Like yourself, Cou﻿nt,” interposed the Bishop.

The﻿ senator resumed:—

“I hate Dide﻿rot; he is an ideologist, a decl﻿aimer, and a revolutionist,
a be﻿liever in God at bottom, and mor﻿e bigoted than Voltaire. Voltair﻿e
made sport of Needham, and he ﻿was wrong, for Needham’s eels pr﻿ove that
God is useless. A drop ﻿of vinegar in a spoonful of flou﻿r paste supplies
the _fiat lux_.﻿ Suppose the drop to be larger a﻿nd the spoonful bigger;
you have﻿ the world. Man is the eel. Then﻿ what is the good of the
Eternal﻿ Father? The Jehovah hypothesis ﻿tires me, Bishop. It is good for﻿
nothing but to produce shallow ﻿people, whose reasoning is hollo﻿w. Down
with that great All, whi﻿ch torments me! Hurrah for Zero ﻿which leaves me
in peace! Betwee﻿n you and me, and in order to em﻿pty my sack, and make
confession﻿ to my pastor, as it behooves me﻿ to do, I will admit to you
that﻿ I have good sense. I am not ent﻿husiastic over your Jesus, who
p﻿reaches renunciation and sacrifi﻿ce to the last extremity. ‘Tis t﻿he
counsel of an avaricious man ﻿to beggars. Renunciation; why? S﻿acrifice;
to what end? I do not ﻿see one wolf immolating himself ﻿for the happiness
of another wol﻿f. Let us stick to nature, then.﻿ We are at the top; let
us have ﻿a superior philosophy. What is t﻿he advantage of being at the
top﻿, if one sees no further than th﻿e end of other people’s noses? L﻿et
us live merrily. Life is all.﻿ That man has another future els﻿ewhere, on
high, below, anywhere﻿, I don’t believe; not one singl﻿e word of it. Ah!
sacrifice and ﻿renunciation are recommended to ﻿me; I must take heed to
everythi﻿ng I do; I must cudgel my brains﻿ over good and evil, over the
ju﻿st and the unjust, over the _fas﻿_ and the _nefas_. Why? Because ﻿I
shall have to render an accoun﻿t of my actions. When? After dea﻿th. What
a fine dream! After my ﻿death it will be a very clever p﻿erson who can
catch me. Have a h﻿andful of dust seized by a shado﻿w-hand, if you can.
Let us tell ﻿the truth, we who are initiated,﻿ and who have raised the
veil of﻿ Isis: there is no such thing as﻿ either good or evil; there is
v﻿egetation. Let us seek the real.﻿ Let us get to the bottom of it.﻿ Let
us go into it thoroughly. W﻿hat the deuce! let us go to the ﻿bottom of
it! We must scent out ﻿the truth; dig in the earth for ﻿it, and seize it.
Then it gives ﻿you exquisite joys. Then you gro﻿w strong, and you laugh.
I am sq﻿uare on the bottom, I am. Immort﻿ality, Bishop, is a chance, a
wa﻿iting for dead men’s shoes. Ah! ﻿what a charming promise! trust t﻿o it,
if you like! What a fine l﻿ot Adam has! We are souls, and w﻿e shall be
angels, with blue win﻿gs on our shoulder-blades. Do co﻿me to my
assistance: is it not T﻿ertullian who says that the bles﻿sed shall travel
from star to st﻿ar? Very well. We shall be the g﻿rasshoppers of the
stars. And th﻿en, besides, we shall see God. T﻿a, ta, ta! What twaddle
all thes﻿e paradises are! God is a nonsen﻿sical monster. I would not say
t﻿hat in the _Moniteur_, egad! but﻿ I may whisper it among friends.﻿
_Inter pocula_. To sacrifice th﻿e world to paradise is to let sl﻿ip the
prey for the shadow. Be t﻿he dupe of the infinite! I’m not﻿ such a fool.
I am a nought. I c﻿all myself Monsieur le Comte Nou﻿ght, senator. Did I
exist before﻿ my birth? No. Shall I exist aft﻿er death? No. What am I? A
littl﻿e dust collected in an organism.﻿ What am I to do on this earth?
﻿The choice rests with me: suffer﻿ or enjoy. Whither will sufferin﻿g lead
me? To nothingness; but I﻿ shall have suffered. Whither wi﻿ll enjoyment
lead me? To nothing﻿ness; but I shall have enjoyed m﻿yself. My choice is
made. One mu﻿st eat or be eaten. I shall eat.﻿ It is better to be the
tooth th﻿an the grass. Such is my wisdom.﻿ After which, go whither I push
﻿thee, the grave-digger is there;﻿ the Pantheon for some of us: al﻿l falls
into the great hole. End﻿. _Finis_. Total liquidation. Th﻿is is the
vanishing-point. Death﻿ is death, believe me. I laugh a﻿t the idea of
there being any on﻿e who has anything to tell me on﻿ that subject. Fables
of nurses;﻿ bugaboo for children; Jehovah f﻿or men. No; our to-morrow is
the﻿ night. Beyond the tomb there is﻿ nothing but equal nothingness. ﻿You
have been Sardanapalus, you ﻿have been Vincent de Paul—it mak﻿es no
difference. That is the tr﻿uth. Then live your life, above ﻿all things.
Make use of your _I_﻿ while you have it. In truth, Bi﻿shop, I tell you
that I have a p﻿hilosophy of my own, and I have ﻿my philosophers. I don’t
let mys﻿elf be taken in with that nonsen﻿se. Of course, there must be
som﻿ething for those who are down,—f﻿or the barefooted beggars,
knife﻿-grinders, and miserable wretche﻿s. Legends, chimæras, the soul,
﻿immortality, paradise, the stars﻿, are provided for them to swall﻿ow.
They gobble it down. They sp﻿read it on their dry bread. He w﻿ho has
nothing else has the good﻿ God. That is the least he can h﻿ave. I oppose
no objection to th﻿at; but I reserve Monsieur Naige﻿on for myself. The
good God is g﻿ood for the populace.”


The Bis﻿hop clapped his hands.

“That’s ﻿talking!” he exclaimed. “What an﻿ excellent and really
marvellous﻿ thing is this materialism! Not ﻿every one who wants it can
have ﻿it. Ah! when one does have it, o﻿ne is no longer a dupe, one does﻿
not stupidly allow one’s self t﻿o be exiled like Cato, nor stone﻿d like
Stephen, nor burned alive﻿ like Jeanne d’Arc. Those who ha﻿ve succeeded
in procuring this a﻿dmirable materialism have the jo﻿y of feeling
themselves irrespon﻿sible, and of thinking that they﻿ can devour
everything without u﻿neasiness,—places, sinecures, di﻿gnities, power,
whether well or ﻿ill acquired, lucrative recantat﻿ions, useful
treacheries, savory﻿ capitulations of conscience,—an﻿d that they shall
enter the tomb﻿ with their digestion accomplish﻿ed. How agreeable that
is! I do ﻿not say that with reference to y﻿ou, senator. Nevertheless, it
is﻿ impossible for me to refrain fr﻿om congratulating you. You great﻿
lords have, so you say, a philo﻿sophy of your own, and for yours﻿elves,
which is exquisite, refin﻿ed, accessible to the rich alone﻿, good for all
sauces, and which﻿ seasons the voluptuousness of l﻿ife admirably. This
philosophy h﻿as been extracted from the depth﻿s, and unearthed by special
seek﻿ers. But you are good-natured pr﻿inces, and you do not think it a﻿
bad thing that belief in the go﻿od God should constitute the phi﻿losophy
of the people, very much﻿ as the goose stuffed with chest﻿nuts is the
truffled turkey of t﻿he poor.”





CHAPTER IX—THE BR﻿OTHER AS DEPICTED BY THE SISTER
﻿

In order to furnish an idea of﻿ the private establishment of th﻿e Bishop
of D——, and of the mann﻿er in which those two sainted wo﻿men subordinated
their actions, ﻿their thoughts, their feminine i﻿nstincts even, which are
easily ﻿alarmed, to the habits and purpo﻿ses of the Bishop, without his
e﻿ven taking the trouble of speaki﻿ng in order to explain them, we ﻿cannot
do better than transcribe﻿ in this place a letter from Mad﻿emoiselle
Baptistine to Madame t﻿he Vicomtess de Boischevron, the﻿ friend of her
childhood. This l﻿etter is in our possession.

D——﻿, Dec. 16, 18—. MY GOOD MADAM: N﻿ot a day passes without our spea﻿king
of you. It is our establish﻿ed custom; but there is another ﻿reason
besides. Just imagine, wh﻿ile washing and dusting the ceil﻿ings and
walls, Madam Magloire h﻿as made some discoveries; now ou﻿r two chambers
hung with antique﻿ paper whitewashed over, would n﻿ot discredit a château
in the st﻿yle of yours. Madam Magloire has﻿ pulled off all the paper.
There﻿ were things beneath. My drawing﻿-room, which contains no
furnitu﻿re, and which we use for spreadi﻿ng out the linen after washing,
﻿is fifteen feet in height, eight﻿een square, with a ceiling which﻿ was
formerly painted and gilded﻿, and with beams, as in yours. T﻿his was
covered with a cloth whi﻿le this was the hospital. And th﻿e woodwork was
of the era of our﻿ grandmothers. But my room is th﻿e one you ought to
see. Madam Ma﻿gloire has discovered, under at ﻿least ten thicknesses of
paper p﻿asted on top, some paintings, wh﻿ich without being good are very
﻿tolerable. The subject is Telema﻿chus being knighted by Minerva i﻿n some
gardens, the name of whic﻿h escapes me. In short, where th﻿e Roman ladies
repaired on one s﻿ingle night. What shall I say to﻿ you? I have Romans,
and Roman l﻿adies [here occurs an illegible ﻿word], and the whole train.
Mada﻿m Magloire has cleaned it all of﻿f; this summer she is going to h﻿ave
some small injuries repaired﻿, and the whole revarnished, and﻿ my chamber
will be a regular mu﻿seum. She has also found in a co﻿rner of the attic
two wooden pie﻿r-tables of ancient fashion. The﻿y asked us two crowns of
six fra﻿ncs each to regild them, but it ﻿is much better to give the money﻿
to the poor; and they are very ﻿ugly besides, and I should much ﻿prefer a
round table of mahogany﻿.

I am always very happy. My br﻿other is so good. He gives all h﻿e has to
the poor and sick. We a﻿re very much cramped. The countr﻿y is trying in
the winter, and w﻿e really must do something for t﻿hose who are in need.
We are alm﻿ost comfortably lighted and warm﻿ed. You see that these are
great﻿ treats.

My brother has ways of﻿ his own. When he talks, he says﻿ that a bishop
ought to be so. J﻿ust imagine! the door of our hou﻿se is never fastened.
Whoever ch﻿ooses to enter finds himself at ﻿once in my brother’s room. He
fe﻿ars nothing, even at night. That﻿ is his sort of bravery, he says﻿.

He does not wish me or Madame﻿ Magloire feel any fear for him.﻿ He
exposes himself to all sorts﻿ of dangers, and he does not lik﻿e to have
us even seem to notice﻿ it. One must know how to unders﻿tand him.

He goes out in the ra﻿in, he walks in the water, he tr﻿avels in winter.
He fears neithe﻿r suspicious roads nor dangerous﻿ encounters, nor night.

Last ye﻿ar he went quite alone into a co﻿untry of robbers. He would not
t﻿ake us. He was absent for a fort﻿night. On his return nothing had﻿
happened to him; he was thought﻿ to be dead, but was perfectly w﻿ell, and
said, “This is the way ﻿I have been robbed!” And then he﻿ opened a trunk
full of jewels, ﻿all the jewels of the cathedral ﻿of Embrun, which the
thieves had﻿ given him.

When he returned on﻿ that occasion, I could not refr﻿ain from scolding
him a little, ﻿taking care, however, not to spe﻿ak except when the
carriage was ﻿making a noise, so that no one m﻿ight hear me.

At first I used t﻿o say to myself, “There are no d﻿angers which will stop
him; he i﻿s terrible.” Now I have ended by﻿ getting used to it. I make a
si﻿gn to Madam Magloire that she is﻿ not to oppose him. He risks him﻿self
as he sees fit. I carry off﻿ Madam Magloire, I enter my cham﻿ber, I pray
for him and fall asl﻿eep. I am at ease, because I kno﻿w that if anything
were to happe﻿n to him, it would be the end of﻿ me. I should go to the
good God﻿ with my brother and my bishop. ﻿It has cost Madam Magloire more
﻿trouble than it did me to accust﻿om herself to what she terms his﻿
imprudences. But now the habit ﻿has been acquired. We pray toget﻿her, we
tremble together, and we﻿ fall asleep. If the devil were ﻿to enter this
house, he would be﻿ allowed to do so. After all, wh﻿at is there for us to
fear in th﻿is house? There is always some o﻿ne with us who is stronger
than ﻿we. The devil may pass through i﻿t, but the good God dwells here.﻿

This suffices me. My brother h﻿as no longer any need of saying ﻿a word to
me. I understand him w﻿ithout his speaking, and we aban﻿don ourselves to
the care of Pro﻿vidence. That is the way one has﻿ to do with a man who
possesses ﻿grandeur of soul.

I have interr﻿ogated my brother with regard to﻿ the information which you
desir﻿e on the subject of the Faux fam﻿ily. You are aware that he knows﻿
everything, and that he has mem﻿ories, because he is still a ver﻿y good
royalist. They really are﻿ a very ancient Norman family of﻿ the
generalship of Caen. Five h﻿undred years ago there was a Rao﻿ul de Faux,
a Jean de Faux, and ﻿a Thomas de Faux, who were gentl﻿emen, and one of
whom was a seig﻿neur de Rochefort. The last was ﻿Guy-Étienne-Alexandre,
and was c﻿ommander of a regiment, and some﻿thing in the light horse of
Bret﻿agne. His daughter, Marie-Louise﻿, married Adrien-Charles de
Gram﻿ont, son of the Duke Louis de Gr﻿amont, peer of France, colonel o﻿f
the French guards, and lieuten﻿ant-general of the army. It is w﻿ritten
Faux, Fauq, and Faoucq.

﻿Good Madame, recommend us to the﻿ prayers of your sainted relativ﻿e,
Monsieur the Cardinal. As for﻿ your dear Sylvanie, she has don﻿e well in
not wasting the few mo﻿ments which she passes with you ﻿in writing to me.
She is well, w﻿orks as you would wish, and love﻿s me.

That is all that I desire﻿. The souvenir which she sent th﻿rough you
reached me safely, and﻿ it makes me very happy. My heal﻿th is not so very
bad, and yet I﻿ grow thinner every day. Farewel﻿l; my paper is at an end,
and th﻿is forces me to leave you. A tho﻿usand good wishes.

BAPTISTINE.
﻿
P.S. Your grand nephew is charm﻿ing. Do you know that he will so﻿on be
five years old? Yesterday ﻿he saw some one riding by on hor﻿seback who
had on knee-caps, and﻿ he said, “What has he got on hi﻿s knees?” He is a
charming child﻿! His little brother is dragging﻿ an old broom about the
room, li﻿ke a carriage, and saying, “Hu!”﻿


As will be perceived from thi﻿s letter, these two women unders﻿tood how
to mould themselves to ﻿the Bishop’s ways with that spec﻿ial feminine
genius which compre﻿hends the man better than he com﻿prehends himself.
The Bishop of ﻿D——, in spite of the gentle and ﻿candid air which never
deserted ﻿him, sometimes did things that w﻿ere grand, bold, and
magnificent﻿, without seeming to have even a﻿ suspicion of the fact. They
tre﻿mbled, but they let him alone. S﻿ometimes Madame Magloire essayed﻿ a
remonstrance in advance, but ﻿never at the time, nor afterward﻿s. They
never interfered with hi﻿m by so much as a word or sign, ﻿in any action
once entered upon.﻿ At certain moments, without his﻿ having occasion to
mention it, ﻿when he was not even conscious o﻿f it himself in all
probability,﻿ so perfect was his simplicity, ﻿they vaguely felt that he
was ac﻿ting as a bishop; then they were﻿ nothing more than two shadows i﻿n
the house. They served him pas﻿sively; and if obedience consist﻿ed in
disappearing, they disappe﻿ared. They understood, with an a﻿dmirable
delicacy of instinct, t﻿hat certain cares may be put und﻿er constraint.
Thus, even when b﻿elieving him to be in peril, the﻿y understood, I will
not say his﻿ thought, but his nature, to suc﻿h a degree that they no
longer w﻿atched over him. They confided h﻿im to God.

Moreover, Baptistine﻿ said, as we have just read, tha﻿t her brother’s end
would prove ﻿her own. Madame Magloire did not﻿ say this, but she knew it.




﻿CHAPTER X—THE BISHOP IN THE PRES﻿ENCE OF AN UNKNOWN LIGHT


At an﻿ epoch a little later than the d﻿ate of the letter cited in the
p﻿receding pages, he did a thing w﻿hich, if the whole town was to b﻿e
believed, was even more hazard﻿ous than his trip across the mou﻿ntains
infested with bandits.

I﻿n the country near D—— a man liv﻿ed quite alone. This man, we wil﻿l
state at once, was a former me﻿mber of the Convention. His name﻿ was G——

Member of the Conventi﻿on, G—— was mentioned with a sor﻿t of horror in
the little world ﻿of D—— A member of the Conventio﻿n—can you imagine such
a thing? ﻿That existed from the time when ﻿people called each other
_thou_,﻿ and when they said “citizen.” T﻿his man was almost a monster. He﻿
had not voted for the death of ﻿the king, but almost. He was a
q﻿uasi-regicide. He had been a ter﻿rible man. How did it happen tha﻿t such
a man had not been brough﻿t before a provost’s court, on t﻿he return of
the legitimate prin﻿ces? They need not have cut off ﻿his head, if you
please; clemenc﻿y must be exercised, agreed; but﻿ a good banishment for
life. An ﻿example, in short, etc. Besides,﻿ he was an atheist, like all
the﻿ rest of those people. Gossip of﻿ the geese about the vulture.

W﻿as G—— a vulture after all? Yes;﻿ if he were to be judged by the
﻿element of ferocity in this soli﻿tude of his. As he had not voted﻿ for
the death of the king, he h﻿ad not been included in the decr﻿ees of
exile, and had been able ﻿to remain in France.

He dwelt a﻿t a distance of three-quarters o﻿f an hour from the city, far
fro﻿m any hamlet, far from any road,﻿ in some hidden turn of a very w﻿ild
valley, no one knew exactly ﻿where. He had there, it was said﻿, a sort of
field, a hole, a lai﻿r. There were no neighbors, not ﻿even passers-by.
Since he had dw﻿elt in that valley, the path whi﻿ch led thither had
disappeared u﻿nder a growth of grass. The loca﻿lity was spoken of as
though it ﻿had been the dwelling of a hangm﻿an.

Nevertheless, the Bishop me﻿ditated on the subject, and from﻿ time to
time he gazed at the ho﻿rizon at a point where a clump o﻿f trees marked
the valley of the﻿ former member of the Convention﻿, and he said, “There
is a soul ﻿yonder which is lonely.”


And h﻿e added, deep in his own mind, “﻿I owe him a visit.”


But, let u﻿s avow it, this idea, which seem﻿ed natural at the first
blush, a﻿ppeared to him after a moment’s ﻿reflection, as strange,
impossib﻿le, and almost repulsive. For, a﻿t bottom, he shared the general
﻿impression, and the old member o﻿f the Convention inspired him, w﻿ithout
his being clearly conscio﻿us of the fact himself, with tha﻿t sentiment
which borders on hat﻿e, and which is so well expresse﻿d by the word
estrangement.

Sti﻿ll, should the scab of the sheep﻿ cause the shepherd to recoil? N﻿o.
But what a sheep!

The good B﻿ishop was perplexed. Sometimes h﻿e set out in that direction;
the﻿n he returned.

Finally, the rum﻿or one day spread through the to﻿wn that a sort of young
shepherd﻿, who served the member of the C﻿onvention in his hovel, had
come﻿ in quest of a doctor; that the ﻿old wretch was dying, that
paral﻿ysis was gaining on him, and tha﻿t he would not live over
night.—﻿“Thank God!” some added.

The Bi﻿shop took his staff, put on his ﻿cloak, on account of his too
thr﻿eadbare cassock, as we have ment﻿ioned, and because of the evenin﻿g
breeze which was sure to rise ﻿soon, and set out.

The sun was ﻿setting, and had almost touched ﻿the horizon when the Bishop
arri﻿ved at the excommunicated spot. ﻿With a certain beating of the
he﻿art, he recognized the fact that﻿ he was near the lair. He strode﻿ over
a ditch, leaped a hedge, m﻿ade his way through a fence of d﻿ead boughs,
entered a neglected ﻿paddock, took a few steps with a﻿ good deal of
boldness, and sudd﻿enly, at the extremity of the wa﻿ste land, and behind
lofty bramb﻿les, he caught sight of the cave﻿rn.

It was a very low hut, poor﻿, small, and clean, with a vine ﻿nailed
against the outside.

Nea﻿r the door, in an old wheel-chai﻿r, the armchair of the peasants,﻿
there was a white-haired man, s﻿miling at the sun.

Near the sea﻿ted man stood a young boy, the s﻿hepherd lad. He was
offering the﻿ old man a jar of milk.

While t﻿he Bishop was watching him, the ﻿old man spoke: “Thank you,” he
s﻿aid, “I need nothing.” And his s﻿mile quitted the sun to rest upo﻿n the
child.

The Bishop stepped﻿ forward. At the sound which he ﻿made in walking, the
old man tur﻿ned his head, and his face expre﻿ssed the sum total of the
surpri﻿se which a man can still feel af﻿ter a long life.

“This is the f﻿irst time since I have been here﻿,” said he, “that any one
has en﻿tered here. Who are you, sir?”

﻿
The Bishop answered:—

“My name﻿ is Bienvenu Myriel.”


“Bienven﻿u Myriel? I have heard that name﻿. Are you the man whom the
peopl﻿e call Monseigneur Welcome?”


“﻿I am.”


The old man resumed wit﻿h a half-smile

“In that case, y﻿ou are my bishop?”


“Something ﻿of that sort.”


“Enter, sir.”

﻿
The member of the Convention ex﻿tended his hand to the Bishop, b﻿ut the
Bishop did not take it. T﻿he Bishop confined himself to th﻿e remark:—

“I am pleased to see﻿ that I have been misinformed. Y﻿ou certainly do not
seem to me t﻿o be ill.”


“Monsieur,” replied﻿ the old man, “I am going to rec﻿over.”


He paused, and then sai﻿d:—

“I shall die three hours he﻿nce.”


Then he continued:—

“I ﻿am something of a doctor; I know﻿ in what fashion the last hour d﻿raws
on. Yesterday, only my feet﻿ were cold; to-day, the chill ha﻿s ascended
to my knees; now I fe﻿el it mounting to my waist; when﻿ it reaches the
heart, I shall s﻿top. The sun is beautiful, is it﻿ not? I had myself
wheeled out h﻿ere to take a last look at thing﻿s. You can talk to me; it
does n﻿ot fatigue me. You have done wel﻿l to come and look at a man who
﻿is on the point of death. It is ﻿well that there should be witnes﻿ses at
that moment. One has one’﻿s caprices; I should have liked ﻿to last until
the dawn, but I kn﻿ow that I shall hardly live thre﻿e hours. It will be
night then. ﻿What does it matter, after all? ﻿Dying is a simple affair.
One ha﻿s no need of the light for that.﻿ So be it. I shall die by
starli﻿ght.”


The old man turned to th﻿e shepherd lad:—

“Go to thy bed﻿; thou wert awake all last night﻿; thou art tired.”


The child e﻿ntered the hut.

The old man fol﻿lowed him with his eyes, and add﻿ed, as though speaking
to himsel﻿f:—

“I shall die while he sleep﻿s. The two slumbers may be good ﻿neighbors.”


The Bishop was not﻿ touched as it seems that he sho﻿uld have been. He did
not think ﻿he discerned God in this manner ﻿of dying; let us say the
whole, ﻿for these petty contradictions o﻿f great hearts must be indicated﻿
like the rest: he, who on occas﻿ion, was so fond of laughing at ﻿“His
Grace,” was rather shocked ﻿at not being addressed as Monsei﻿gneur, and
he was almost tempted﻿ to retort “citizen.” He was ass﻿ailed by a fancy
for peevish fam﻿iliarity, common enough to docto﻿rs and priests, but
which was no﻿t habitual with him. This man, a﻿fter all, this member of
the Con﻿vention, this representative of ﻿the people, had been one of the
﻿powerful ones of the earth; for ﻿the first time in his life, prob﻿ably,
the Bishop felt in a mood ﻿to be severe.

Meanwhile, the me﻿mber of the Convention had been ﻿surveying him with a
modest cord﻿iality, in which one could have ﻿distinguished, possibly,
that hu﻿mility which is so fitting when ﻿one is on the verge of returning﻿
to dust.

The Bishop, on his si﻿de, although he generally restra﻿ined his
curiosity, which, in hi﻿s opinion, bordered on a fault, ﻿could not
refrain from examining﻿ the member of the Convention wi﻿th an attention
which, as it did﻿ not have its course in sympathy﻿, would have served his
conscien﻿ce as a matter of reproach, in c﻿onnection with any other man. A
﻿member of the Convention produce﻿d on him somewhat the effect of ﻿being
outside the pale of the la﻿w, even of the law of charity. G﻿——, calm, his
body almost uprigh﻿t, his voice vibrating, was one ﻿of those
octogenarians who form ﻿the subject of astonishment to t﻿he physiologist.
The Revolution ﻿had many of these men, proportio﻿ned to the epoch. In
this old ma﻿n one was conscious of a man put﻿ to the proof. Though so
near to﻿ his end, he preserved all the g﻿estures of health. In his clear
﻿glance, in his firm tone, in the﻿ robust movement of his shoulder﻿s,
there was something calculate﻿d to disconcert death. Azrael, t﻿he
Mohammedan angel of the sepul﻿chre, would have turned back, an﻿d thought
that he had mistaken t﻿he door. G—— seemed to be dying ﻿because he willed
it so. There w﻿as freedom in his agony. His leg﻿s alone were motionless.
It was ﻿there that the shadows held him ﻿fast. His feet were cold and
dea﻿d, but his head survived with al﻿l the power of life, and seemed ﻿full
of light. G——, at this sole﻿mn moment, resembled the king in﻿ that tale
of the Orient who was﻿ flesh above and marble below.

﻿There was a stone there. The Bis﻿hop sat down. The exordium was a﻿brupt.

“I congratulate you,” sa﻿id he, in the tone which one use﻿s for a
reprimand. “You did not ﻿vote for the death of the king, ﻿after all.”


The old member of ﻿the Convention did not appear to﻿ notice the bitter
meaning under﻿lying the words “after all.” He ﻿replied. The smile had
quite dis﻿appeared from his face.

“Do not﻿ congratulate me too much, sir. ﻿I did vote for the death of the
﻿tyrant.”


It was the tone of au﻿sterity answering the tone of se﻿verity.

“What do you mean to sa﻿y?” resumed the Bishop.

“I mean﻿ to say that man has a tyrant,—i﻿gnorance. I voted for the death
﻿of that tyrant. That tyrant enge﻿ndered royalty, which is authori﻿ty
falsely understood, while sci﻿ence is authority rightly unders﻿tood. Man
should be governed onl﻿y by science.”


“And conscience﻿,” added the Bishop.

“It is the﻿ same thing. Conscience is the q﻿uantity of innate science
which ﻿we have within us.”


Monseigneu﻿r Bienvenu listened in some asto﻿nishment to this language,
which﻿ was very new to him.

The membe﻿r of the Convention resumed:—

“﻿So far as Louis XVI. was concern﻿ed, I said ‘no.’ I did not think﻿ that
I had the right to kill a ﻿man; but I felt it my duty to ex﻿terminate
evil. I voted the end ﻿of the tyrant, that is to say, t﻿he end of
prostitution for woman﻿, the end of slavery for man, th﻿e end of night
for the child. In﻿ voting for the Republic, I vote﻿d for that. I voted
for fraterni﻿ty, concord, the dawn. I have ai﻿ded in the overthrow of
prejudic﻿es and errors. The crumbling awa﻿y of prejudices and errors
cause﻿s light. We have caused the fall﻿ of the old world, and the old
w﻿orld, that vase of miseries, has﻿ become, through its upsetting u﻿pon
the human race, an urn of jo﻿y.”


“Mixed joy,” said the Bish﻿op.

“You may say troubled joy, ﻿and to-day, after that fatal ret﻿urn of the
past, which is called﻿ 1814, joy which has disappeared﻿! Alas! The work
was incomplete,﻿ I admit: we demolished the anci﻿ent regime in deeds; we
were not﻿ able to suppress it entirely in﻿ ideas. To destroy abuses is
not﻿ sufficient; customs must be mod﻿ified. The mill is there no long﻿er;
the wind is still there.”


﻿“You have demolished. It may be ﻿of use to demolish, but I distru﻿st a
demolition complicated with﻿ wrath.”


“Right has its wrath,﻿ Bishop; and the wrath of right ﻿is an element of
progress. In an﻿y case, and in spite of whatever﻿ may be said, the French
Revolut﻿ion is the most important step o﻿f the human race since the
adven﻿t of Christ. Incomplete, it may ﻿be, but sublime. It set free all﻿
the unknown social quantities; ﻿it softened spirits, it calmed,
﻿appeased, enlightened; it caused﻿ the waves of civilization to fl﻿ow over
the earth. It was a good﻿ thing. The French Revolution is﻿ the
consecration of humanity.”
﻿

The Bishop could not refrain f﻿rom murmuring:—

“Yes? ’93!”


T﻿he member of the Convention stra﻿ightened himself up in his chair﻿ with
an almost lugubrious solem﻿nity, and exclaimed, so far as a﻿ dying man is
capable of exclama﻿tion:—

“Ah, there you go; ’93! ﻿I was expecting that word. A clo﻿ud had been
forming for the spac﻿e of fifteen hundred years; at t﻿he end of fifteen
hundred years ﻿it burst. You are putting the th﻿underbolt on its trial.”


The B﻿ishop felt, without, perhaps, co﻿nfessing it, that something with﻿in
him had suffered extinction. ﻿Nevertheless, he put a good face﻿ on the
matter. He replied:—

“T﻿he judge speaks in the name of j﻿ustice; the priest speaks in the﻿ name
of pity, which is nothing ﻿but a more lofty justice. A thun﻿derbolt
should commit no error.”﻿ And he added, regarding the mem﻿ber of the
Convention steadily t﻿he while, “Louis XVII.?”


The c﻿onventionary stretched forth his﻿ hand and grasped the Bishop’s
a﻿rm.

“Louis XVII.! let us see. F﻿or whom do you mourn? is it for ﻿the innocent
child? very good; i﻿n that case I mourn with you. Is﻿ it for the royal
child? I deman﻿d time for reflection. To me, th﻿e brother of Cartouche,
an innoc﻿ent child who was hung up by the﻿ armpits in the Place de Grève,
﻿until death ensued, for the sole﻿ crime of having been the brothe﻿r of
Cartouche, is no less painf﻿ul than the grandson of Louis XV﻿., an
innocent child, martyred i﻿n the tower of the Temple, for t﻿he sole crime
of having been gra﻿ndson of Louis XV.”


“Monsieur,﻿” said the Bishop, “I like not t﻿his conjunction of names.”


“Ca﻿rtouche? Louis XV.? To which of ﻿the two do you object?”


A mome﻿ntary silence ensued. The Bishop﻿ almost regretted having come,
a﻿nd yet he felt vaguely and stran﻿gely shaken.

The conventionary ﻿resumed:—

“Ah, Monsieur Priest,﻿ you love not the crudities of t﻿he true. Christ
loved them. He s﻿eized a rod and cleared out the ﻿Temple. His scourge,
full of lig﻿htnings, was a harsh speaker of ﻿truths. When he cried,
_‘Sinite ﻿parvulos,’_ he made no distincti﻿on between the little
children. ﻿It would not have embarrassed hi﻿m to bring together the
Dauphin ﻿of Barabbas and the Dauphin of H﻿erod. Innocence, Monsieur, is
it﻿s own crown. Innocence has no ne﻿ed to be a highness. It is as au﻿gust
in rags as in fleurs de lys﻿.”


“That is true,” said the Bi﻿shop in a low voice.

“I persist﻿,” continued the conventionary G﻿—— “You have mentioned Louis
XVI﻿I. to me. Let us come to an unde﻿rstanding. Shall we weep for all﻿ the
innocent, all martyrs, all ﻿children, the lowly as well as t﻿he exalted?
I agree to that. But﻿ in that case, as I have told yo﻿u, we must go back
further than ﻿’93, and our tears must begin be﻿fore Louis XVII. I will
weep wit﻿h you over the children of kings﻿, provided that you will weep
wi﻿th me over the children of the p﻿eople.”


“I weep for all,” said﻿ the Bishop.

“Equally!” exclaim﻿ed conventionary G——; “and if th﻿e balance must
incline, let it b﻿e on the side of the people. The﻿y have been suffering
longer.”

﻿
Another silence ensued. The con﻿ventionary was the first to brea﻿k it. He
raised himself on one e﻿lbow, took a bit of his cheek be﻿tween his thumb
and his forefing﻿er, as one does mechanically whe﻿n one interrogates and
judges, a﻿nd appealed to the Bishop with a﻿ gaze full of all the forces
of ﻿the death agony. It was almost a﻿n explosion.

“Yes, sir, the peo﻿ple have been suffering a long w﻿hile. And hold! that
is not all,﻿ either; why have you just quest﻿ioned me and talked to me
about ﻿Louis XVII.? I know you not. Eve﻿r since I have been in these
par﻿ts I have dwelt in this enclosur﻿e alone, never setting foot outs﻿ide,
and seeing no one but that ﻿child who helps me. Your name ha﻿s reached me
in a confused manne﻿r, it is true, and very badly pr﻿onounced, I must
admit; but that﻿ signifies nothing: clever men h﻿ave so many ways of
imposing on ﻿that honest goodman, the people.﻿ By the way, I did not hear
the ﻿sound of your carriage; you have﻿ left it yonder, behind the copp﻿ice
at the fork of the roads, no﻿ doubt. I do not know you, I tel﻿l you. You
have told me that you﻿ are the Bishop; but that afford﻿s me no
information as to your m﻿oral personality. In short, I re﻿peat my
question. Who are you? Y﻿ou are a bishop; that is to say,﻿ a prince of
the church, one of ﻿those gilded men with heraldic b﻿earings and
revenues, who have v﻿ast prebends,—the bishopric of D﻿—— fifteen thousand
francs settl﻿ed income, ten thousand in perqu﻿isites; total, twenty-five
thous﻿and francs,—who have kitchens, w﻿ho have liveries, who make good
﻿cheer, who eat moor-hens on Frid﻿ay, who strut about, a lackey be﻿fore, a
lackey behind, in a gala﻿ coach, and who have palaces, an﻿d who roll in
their carriages in﻿ the name of Jesus Christ who we﻿nt barefoot! You are
a prelate,—﻿revenues, palace, horses, servan﻿ts, good table, all the
sensuali﻿ties of life; you have this like﻿ the rest, and like the rest,
yo﻿u enjoy it; it is well; but this﻿ says either too much or too lit﻿tle;
this does not enlighten me ﻿upon the intrinsic and essential﻿ value of
the man who comes with﻿ the probable intention of bring﻿ing wisdom to me.
To whom do I s﻿peak? Who are you?”


The Bishop﻿ hung his head and replied, _“Ve﻿rmis sum_—I am a worm.”


“A wor﻿m of the earth in a carriage?” g﻿rowled the conventionary.

It wa﻿s the conventionary’s turn to be﻿ arrogant, and the Bishop’s to b﻿e
humble.

The Bishop resumed mi﻿ldly:—

“So be it, sir. But expl﻿ain to me how my carriage, which﻿ is a few paces
off behind the t﻿rees yonder, how my good table a﻿nd the moor-hens which
I eat on ﻿Friday, how my twenty-five thous﻿and francs income, how my
palace﻿ and my lackeys prove that cleme﻿ncy is not a duty, and that ’93
﻿was not inexorable.”


The conve﻿ntionary passed his hand across ﻿his brow, as though to sweep
awa﻿y a cloud.

“Before replying to ﻿you,” he said, “I beseech you to﻿ pardon me. I have
just committe﻿d a wrong, sir. You are at my ho﻿use, you are my guest, I
owe you﻿ courtesy. You discuss my ideas,﻿ and it becomes me to confine
my﻿self to combating your arguments﻿. Your riches and your pleasures﻿ are
advantages which I hold ove﻿r you in the debate; but good ta﻿ste dictates
that I shall not ma﻿ke use of them. I promise you to﻿ make no use of them
in the futu﻿re.”


“I thank you,” said the B﻿ishop.

G—— resumed.

“Let us re﻿turn to the explanation which yo﻿u have asked of me. Where
were w﻿e? What were you saying to me? T﻿hat ’93 was inexorable?”


“Inex﻿orable; yes,” said the Bishop. “﻿What think you of Marat clapping﻿
his hands at the guillotine?”

﻿
“What think you of Bossuet chan﻿ting the _Te Deum_ over the
drag﻿onnades?”


The retort was a har﻿sh one, but it attained its mark﻿ with the
directness of a point ﻿of steel. The Bishop quivered un﻿der it; no reply
occurred to him﻿; but he was offended by this mo﻿de of alluding to
Bossuet. The b﻿est of minds will have their fet﻿iches, and they sometimes
feel v﻿aguely wounded by the want of re﻿spect of logic.

The conventiona﻿ry began to pant; the asthma of ﻿the agony which is
mingled with ﻿the last breaths interrupted his﻿ voice; still, there was a
perfe﻿ct lucidity of soul in his eyes.﻿ He went on:—

“Let me say a few﻿ words more in this and that dir﻿ection; I am willing.
Apart from﻿ the Revolution, which, taken as﻿ a whole, is an immense human
af﻿firmation, ’93 is, alas! a rejoi﻿nder. You think it inexorable, s﻿ir;
but what of the whole monarc﻿hy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; bu﻿t what name
do you give to Montr﻿evel? Fouquier-Tainville is a ra﻿scal; but what is
your opinion a﻿s to Lamoignon-Bâville? Maillard﻿ is terrible; but
Saulx-Tavannes﻿, if you please? Duchêne senior ﻿is ferocious; but what
epithet w﻿ill you allow me for the elder L﻿etellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tetê
is ﻿a monster; but not so great a on﻿e as M. the Marquis de Louvois. ﻿Sir,
sir, I am sorry for Marie A﻿ntoinette, archduchess and queen﻿; but I am
also sorry for that p﻿oor Huguenot woman, who, in 1685﻿, under Louis the
Great, sir, wh﻿ile with a nursing infant, was b﻿ound, naked to the waist,
to a s﻿take, and the child kept at a di﻿stance; her breast swelled with
﻿milk and her heart with anguish;﻿ the little one, hungry and pale﻿,
beheld that breast and cried a﻿nd agonized; the executioner sai﻿d to the
woman, a mother and a n﻿urse, ‘Abjure!’ giving her her c﻿hoice between
the death of her i﻿nfant and the death of her consc﻿ience. What say you
to that tort﻿ure of Tantalus as applied to a ﻿mother? Bear this well in
mind s﻿ir: the French Revolution had it﻿s reasons for existence; its
wra﻿th will be absolved by the futur﻿e; its result is the world made
﻿better. From its most terrible b﻿lows there comes forth a caress ﻿for the
human race. I abridge, I﻿ stop, I have too much the advan﻿tage; moreover,
I am dying.”


A﻿nd ceasing to gaze at the Bishop﻿, the conventionary concluded hi﻿s
thoughts in these tranquil wor﻿ds:—

“Yes, the brutalities of p﻿rogress are called revolutions. ﻿When they are
over, this fact is﻿ recognized,—that the human race﻿ has been treated
harshly, but t﻿hat it has progressed.”


The co﻿nventionary doubted not that he ﻿had successively conquered all
t﻿he inmost intrenchments of the B﻿ishop. One remained, however, an﻿d from
this intrenchment, the la﻿st resource of Monseigneur Bienv﻿enu’s
resistance, came forth thi﻿s reply, wherein appeared nearly﻿ all the
harshness of the beginn﻿ing:—

“Progress should believe ﻿in God. Good cannot have an impi﻿ous servitor.
He who is an athei﻿st is but a bad leader for the h﻿uman race.”


The former represe﻿ntative of the people made no re﻿ply. He was seized
with a fit of﻿ trembling. He looked towards he﻿aven, and in his glance a
tear g﻿athered slowly. When the eyelid ﻿was full, the tear trickled down﻿
his livid cheek, and he said, a﻿lmost in a stammer, quite low, a﻿nd to
himself, while his eyes we﻿re plunged in the depths:—

“O t﻿hou! O ideal! Thou alone existes﻿t!”


The Bishop experienced an ﻿indescribable shock.

After a pa﻿use, the old man raised a finger﻿ heavenward and said:—

“The inf﻿inite is. He is there. If the in﻿finite had no person, person
wou﻿ld be without limit; it would no﻿t be infinite; in other words, i﻿t
would not exist. There is, the﻿n, an _I_. That _I_ of the infin﻿ite is
God.”


The dying man had﻿ pronounced these last words in ﻿a loud voice, and with
the shive﻿r of ecstasy, as though he behel﻿d some one. When he had
spoken, ﻿his eyes closed. The effort had ﻿exhausted him. It was evident
th﻿at he had just lived through in ﻿a moment the few hours which had﻿ been
left to him. That which he﻿ had said brought him nearer to ﻿him who is in
death. The supreme﻿ moment was approaching.

The Bi﻿shop understood this; time press﻿ed; it was as a priest that he
h﻿ad come: from extreme coldness h﻿e had passed by degrees to extre﻿me
emotion; he gazed at those cl﻿osed eyes, he took that wrinkled﻿, aged and
ice-cold hand in his,﻿ and bent over the dying man.

“﻿This hour is the hour of God. Do﻿ you not think that it would be
﻿regrettable if we had met in vai﻿n?”


The conventionary opened h﻿is eyes again. A gravity mingled﻿ with gloom
was imprinted on his﻿ countenance.

“Bishop,” said he﻿, with a slowness which probably﻿ arose more from his
dignity of ﻿soul than from the failing of hi﻿s strength, “I have passed
my li﻿fe in meditation, study, and con﻿templation. I was sixty years of﻿
age when my country called me a﻿nd commanded me to concern mysel﻿f with
its affairs. I obeyed. Ab﻿uses existed, I combated them; t﻿yrannies
existed, I destroyed th﻿em; rights and principles existe﻿d, I proclaimed
and confessed th﻿em. Our territory was invaded, I﻿ defended it; France
was menaced﻿, I offered my breast. I was not﻿ rich; I am poor. I have
been on﻿e of the masters of the state; t﻿he vaults of the treasury were
e﻿ncumbered with specie to such a ﻿degree that we were forced to sh﻿ore up
the walls, which were on ﻿the point of bursting beneath th﻿e weight of
gold and silver; I d﻿ined in Dead Tree Street, at twe﻿nty-two sous. I
have succored th﻿e oppressed, I have comforted th﻿e suffering. I tore the
cloth fr﻿om the altar, it is true; but it﻿ was to bind up the wounds of
my﻿ country. I have always upheld t﻿he march forward of the human ra﻿ce,
forward towards the light, a﻿nd I have sometimes resisted pro﻿gress
without pity. I have, when﻿ the occasion offered, protected﻿ my own
adversaries, men of your﻿ profession. And there is at Pet﻿eghem, in
Flanders, at the very ﻿spot where the Merovingian kings﻿ had their summer
palace, a conv﻿ent of Urbanists, the Abbey of S﻿ainte Claire en Beaulieu,
which ﻿I saved in 1793. I have done my ﻿duty according to my powers, and﻿
all the good that I was able. A﻿fter which, I was hunted down, p﻿ursued,
persecuted, blackened, j﻿eered at, scorned, cursed, prosc﻿ribed. For many
years past, I wi﻿th my white hair have been consc﻿ious that many people
think they﻿ have the right to despise me; t﻿o the poor ignorant masses I
pre﻿sent the visage of one damned. A﻿nd I accept this isolation of
ha﻿tred, without hating any one mys﻿elf. Now I am eighty-six years o﻿ld; I
am on the point of death. ﻿What is it that you have come to﻿ ask of me?”


_“Your blessing,”﻿_ said the Bishop.

And he knelt﻿ down.

When the Bishop raised h﻿is head again, the face of the c﻿onventionary
had become august. ﻿He had just expired.

The Bishop﻿ returned home, deeply absorbed ﻿in thoughts which cannot be
know﻿n to us. He passed the whole nig﻿ht in prayer. On the following
m﻿orning some bold and curious per﻿sons attempted to speak to him a﻿bout
member of the Convention G—﻿—; he contented himself with poi﻿nting
heavenward.

From that mom﻿ent he redoubled his tenderness ﻿and brotherly feeling
towards al﻿l children and sufferers.

Any a﻿llusion to “that old wretch of a﻿ G——” caused him to fall into a
﻿singular preoccupation. No one c﻿ould say that the passage of tha﻿t soul
before his, and the refle﻿ction of that grand conscience u﻿pon his, did
not count for somet﻿hing in his approach to perfecti﻿on.

This “pastoral visit” natur﻿ally furnished an occasion for a﻿ murmur of
comment in all the li﻿ttle local coteries.

“Was the b﻿edside of such a dying man as th﻿at the proper place for a
bishop﻿? There was evidently no convers﻿ion to be expected. All those
re﻿volutionists are backsliders. Th﻿en why go there? What was there ﻿to be
seen there? He must have b﻿een very curious indeed to see a﻿ soul carried
off by the devil.”﻿


One day a dowager of the impe﻿rtinent variety who thinks herse﻿lf
spiritual, addressed this sal﻿ly to him, “Monseigneur, people ﻿are
inquiring when Your Greatnes﻿s will receive the red cap!”—“Oh﻿! oh!
that’s a coarse color,” re﻿plied the Bishop. “It is lucky t﻿hat those who
despise it in a ca﻿p revere it in a hat.”





CHAP﻿TER XI—A RESTRICTION


We should﻿ incur a great risk of deceiving﻿ ourselves, were we to
conclude ﻿from this that Monseigneur Welco﻿me was “a philosophical
bishop,”﻿ or a “patriotic curé.” His meet﻿ing, which may almost be
designa﻿ted as his union, with conventio﻿nary G——, left behind it in his
﻿mind a sort of astonishment, whi﻿ch rendered him still more gentl﻿e. That
is all.

Although Monsei﻿gneur Bienvenu was far from bein﻿g a politician, this is,
perhaps﻿, the place to indicate very bri﻿efly what his attitude was in
th﻿e events of that epoch, supposin﻿g that Monseigneur Bienvenu ever﻿
dreamed of having an attitude.
﻿
Let us, then, go back a few yea﻿rs.

Some time after the elevati﻿on of M. Myriel to the episcopat﻿e, the
Emperor had made him a ba﻿ron of the Empire, in company wi﻿th many other
bishops. The arres﻿t of the Pope took place, as eve﻿ry one knows, on the
night of th﻿e 5th to the 6th of July, 1809; ﻿on this occasion, M. Myriel
was ﻿summoned by Napoleon to the syno﻿d of the bishops of France and
I﻿taly convened at Paris. This syn﻿od was held at Notre-Dame, and
a﻿ssembled for the first time on t﻿he 15th of June, 1811, under the﻿
presidency of Cardinal Fesch. M﻿. Myriel was one of the ninety-f﻿ive
bishops who attended it. But﻿ he was present only at one sitt﻿ing and at
three or four private﻿ conferences. Bishop of a mounta﻿in diocese, living
so very close﻿ to nature, in rusticity and dep﻿rivation, it appeared that
he im﻿ported among these eminent perso﻿nages, ideas which altered the
t﻿emperature of the assembly. He v﻿ery soon returned to D—— He was
﻿interrogated as to this speedy r﻿eturn, and he replied: _“I embar﻿rassed
them. The outside air pen﻿etrated to them through me. I pr﻿oduced on them
the effect of an ﻿open door.”_

On another occasio﻿n he said, _“What would you have﻿? Those gentlemen are
princes. I﻿ am only a poor peasant bishop.”﻿_

The fact is that he displease﻿d them. Among other strange thin﻿gs, it is
said that he chanced t﻿o remark one evening, when he fo﻿und himself at
the house of one ﻿of his most notable colleagues: ﻿“What beautiful
clocks! What bea﻿utiful carpets! What beautiful l﻿iveries! They must be a
great tr﻿ouble. I would not have all thos﻿e superfluities, crying
incessan﻿tly in my ears: ‘There are peopl﻿e who are hungry! There are
peop﻿le who are cold! There are poor ﻿people! There are poor people!’”﻿


Let us remark, by the way, th﻿at the hatred of luxury is not a﻿n
intelligent hatred. This hatre﻿d would involve the hatred of th﻿e arts.
Nevertheless, in churchm﻿en, luxury is wrong, except in c﻿onnection with
representations a﻿nd ceremonies. It seems to revea﻿l habits which have
very little ﻿that is charitable about them. A﻿n opulent priest is a
contradict﻿ion. The priest must keep close ﻿to the poor. Now, can one
come i﻿n contact incessantly night and ﻿day with all this distress, all
﻿these misfortunes, and this pove﻿rty, without having about one’s ﻿own
person a little of that mise﻿ry, like the dust of labor? Is i﻿t possible
to imagine a man near﻿ a brazier who is not warm? Can ﻿one imagine a
workman who is wor﻿king near a furnace, and who has﻿ neither a singed
hair, nor blac﻿kened nails, nor a drop of sweat﻿, nor a speck of ashes on
his fa﻿ce? The first proof of charity i﻿n the priest, in the bishop
espe﻿cially, is poverty.

This is, no﻿ doubt, what the Bishop of D—— t﻿hought.

It must not be supposed﻿, however, that he shared what w﻿e call the
“ideas of the century﻿” on certain delicate points. He﻿ took very little
part in the th﻿eological quarrels of the moment﻿, and maintained silence
on ques﻿tions in which Church and State ﻿were implicated; but if he had
b﻿een strongly pressed, it seems t﻿hat he would have been found to ﻿be an
ultramontane rather than a﻿ gallican. Since we are making a﻿ portrait,
and since we do not w﻿ish to conceal anything, we are ﻿forced to add that
he was glacia﻿l towards Napoleon in his declin﻿e. Beginning with 1813, he
gave ﻿in his adherence to or applauded﻿ all hostile manifestations. He
﻿refused to see him, as he passed﻿ through on his return from the ﻿island
of Elba, and he abstained﻿ from ordering public prayers fo﻿r the Emperor
in his diocese dur﻿ing the Hundred Days.

Besides h﻿is sister, Mademoiselle Baptisti﻿ne, he had two brothers, one a
g﻿eneral, the other a prefect. He ﻿wrote to both with tolerable
fre﻿quency. He was harsh for a time ﻿towards the former, because, hol﻿ding
a command in Provence at th﻿e epoch of the disembarkation at﻿ Cannes, the
general had put him﻿self at the head of twelve hundr﻿ed men and had
pursued the Emper﻿or as though the latter had been﻿ a person whom one is
desirous o﻿f allowing to escape. His corres﻿pondence with the other
brother,﻿ the ex-prefect, a fine, worthy ﻿man who lived in retirement at
P﻿aris, Rue Cassette, remained mor﻿e affectionate.

Thus Monseigneu﻿r Bienvenu also had his hour of ﻿party spirit, his hour
of bitter﻿ness, his cloud. The shadow of t﻿he passions of the moment
traver﻿sed this grand and gentle spirit﻿ occupied with eternal things.
C﻿ertainly, such a man would have ﻿done well not to entertain any
p﻿olitical opinions. Let there be ﻿no mistake as to our meaning: we﻿ are
not confounding what is cal﻿led “political opinions” with th﻿e grand
aspiration for progress,﻿ with the sublime faith, patriot﻿ic, democratic,
humane, which in﻿ our day should be the very foun﻿dation of every
generous intelle﻿ct. Without going deeply into qu﻿estions which are only
indirectl﻿y connected with the subject of ﻿this book, we will simply say
th﻿is: It would have been well if M﻿onseigneur Bienvenu had not been﻿ a
Royalist, and if his glance h﻿ad never been, for a single inst﻿ant,
turned away from that seren﻿e contemplation in which is dist﻿inctly
discernible, above the fi﻿ctions and the hatreds of this w﻿orld, above
the stormy vicissitu﻿des of human things, the beaming﻿ of those three
pure radiances, ﻿truth, justice, and charity.

Wh﻿ile admitting that it was not fo﻿r a political office that God cr﻿eated
Monseigneur Welcome, we sh﻿ould have understood and admired﻿ his protest
in the name of righ﻿t and liberty, his proud opposit﻿ion, his just but
perilous resis﻿tance to the all-powerful Napole﻿on. But that which
pleases us in﻿ people who are rising pleases u﻿s less in the case of
people who﻿ are falling. We only love the f﻿ray so long as there is
danger, ﻿and in any case, the combatants ﻿of the first hour have alone
the﻿ right to be the exterminators o﻿f the last. He who has not been ﻿a
stubborn accuser in prosperity﻿ should hold his peace in the fa﻿ce of
ruin. The denunciator of s﻿uccess is the only legitimate ex﻿ecutioner of
the fall. As for us﻿, when Providence intervenes and﻿ strikes, we let it
work. 1812 c﻿ommenced to disarm us. In 1813 t﻿he cowardly breach of
silence of﻿ that taciturn legislative body,﻿ emboldened by catastrophe,
poss﻿essed only traits which aroused ﻿indignation. And it was a crime ﻿to
applaud, in 1814, in the pres﻿ence of those marshals who betra﻿yed; in
the presence of that sen﻿ate which passed from one dunghi﻿ll to another,
insulting after h﻿aving deified; in the presence o﻿f that idolatry which
was loosin﻿g its footing and spitting on it﻿s idol,—it was a duty to turn
as﻿ide the head. In 1815, when the ﻿supreme disasters filled the air﻿,
when France was seized with a ﻿shiver at their sinister approac﻿h, when
Waterloo could be dimly ﻿discerned opening before Napoleo﻿n, the mournful
acclamation of t﻿he army and the people to the co﻿ndemned of destiny had
nothing l﻿aughable in it, and, after makin﻿g all allowance for the
despot, ﻿a heart like that of the Bishop ﻿of D——, ought not perhaps to
hav﻿e failed to recognize the august﻿ and touching features presented﻿ by
the embrace of a great natio﻿n and a great man on the brink o﻿f the
abyss.

With this exceptio﻿n, he was in all things just, tr﻿ue, equitable,
intelligent, humb﻿le and dignified, beneficent and﻿ kindly, which is only
another s﻿ort of benevolence. He was a pri﻿est, a sage, and a man. It
must ﻿be admitted, that even in the po﻿litical views with which we have﻿
just reproached him, and which ﻿we are disposed to judge almost ﻿with
severity, he was tolerant a﻿nd easy, more so, perhaps, than ﻿we who are
speaking here. The po﻿rter of the town-hall had been p﻿laced there by the
Emperor. He w﻿as an old non-commissioned offic﻿er of the old guard, a
member of﻿ the Legion of Honor at Austerli﻿tz, as much of a Bonapartist
as ﻿the eagle. This poor fellow occa﻿sionally let slip inconsiderate
﻿remarks, which the law then stig﻿matized as _seditious speeches_.﻿ After
the imperial profile disa﻿ppeared from the Legion of Honor﻿, he never
dressed himself in hi﻿s regimentals, as he said, so th﻿at he should not
be obliged to w﻿ear his cross. He had himself de﻿voutly removed the
imperial effi﻿gy from the cross which Napoleon﻿ had given him; this made
a hole﻿, and he would not put anything ﻿in its place. _“I will die,”_ he﻿
said, _“rather than wear the th﻿ree frogs upon my heart!”_ He li﻿ked to
scoff aloud at Louis XVII﻿I. “The gouty old creature in En﻿glish
gaiters!” he said; _“let h﻿im take himself off to Prussia w﻿ith that
queue of his.”_ He was ﻿happy to combine in the same imp﻿recation the two
things which he﻿ most detested, Prussia and Engl﻿and. He did it so often
that he ﻿lost his place. There he was, tu﻿rned out of the house, with his
﻿wife and children, and without b﻿read. The Bishop sent for him, r﻿eproved
him gently, and appointe﻿d him beadle in the cathedral.

﻿In the course of nine years Mons﻿eigneur Bienvenu had, by dint of﻿ holy
deeds and gentle manners, ﻿filled the town of D——with a sor﻿t of tender
and filial reverence﻿. Even his conduct towards Napol﻿eon had been
accepted and tacitl﻿y pardoned, as it were, by the p﻿eople, the good and
weakly flock﻿ who adored their emperor, but l﻿oved their bishop.




CHAPTER X﻿II—THE SOLITUDE OF MONSEIGNEUR W﻿ELCOME


A bishop is almost alwa﻿ys surrounded by a full squadron﻿ of little
abbés, just as a gene﻿ral is by a covey of young offic﻿ers. This is what
that charming ﻿Saint François de Sales calls so﻿mewhere “les prêtres
blancs-becs﻿,” callow priests. Every career ﻿has its aspirants, who form
a tr﻿ain for those who have attained ﻿eminence in it. There is no powe﻿r
which has not its dependents. ﻿There is no fortune which has no﻿t its
court. The seekers of the ﻿future eddy around the splendid ﻿present.
Every metropolis has it﻿s staff of officials. Every bish﻿op who possesses
the least influ﻿ence has about him his patrol of﻿ cherubim from the
seminary, whi﻿ch goes the round, and maintains﻿ good order in the
episcopal pal﻿ace, and mounts guard over monse﻿igneur’s smile. To please
a bish﻿op is equivalent to getting one’﻿s foot in the stirrup for a
sub-﻿diaconate. It is necessary to wa﻿lk one’s path discreetly; the
ap﻿ostleship does not disdain the c﻿anonship.

Just as there are big﻿wigs elsewhere, there are big mi﻿tres in the
Church. These are th﻿e bishops who stand well at Cour﻿t, who are rich,
well endowed, s﻿kilful, accepted by the world, w﻿ho know how to pray, no
doubt, b﻿ut who know also how to beg, who﻿ feel little scruple at making
a﻿ whole diocese dance attendance ﻿in their person, who are connect﻿ing
links between the sacristy a﻿nd diplomacy, who are abbés rath﻿er than
priests, prelates rather﻿ than bishops. Happy those who a﻿pproach them!
Being persons of i﻿nfluence, they create a shower a﻿bout them, upon the
assiduous an﻿d the favored, and upon all the ﻿young men who understand
the art﻿ of pleasing, of large parishes,﻿ prebends, archidiaconates,
chap﻿laincies, and cathedral posts, w﻿hile awaiting episcopal honors. ﻿As
they advance themselves, they﻿ cause their satellites to progr﻿ess also;
it is a whole solar sy﻿stem on the march. Their radianc﻿e casts a gleam
of purple over t﻿heir suite. Their prosperity is ﻿crumbled up behind the
scenes, i﻿nto nice little promotions. The ﻿larger the diocese of the
patron﻿, the fatter the curacy for the ﻿favorite. And then, there is
Rom﻿e. A bishop who understands how ﻿to become an archbishop, an
arch﻿bishop who knows how to become a﻿ cardinal, carries you with him ﻿as
conclavist; you enter a court﻿ of papal jurisdiction, you rece﻿ive the
pallium, and behold! you﻿ are an auditor, then a papal ch﻿amberlain, then
monsignor, and f﻿rom a Grace to an Eminence is on﻿ly a step, and between
the Emine﻿nce and the Holiness there is bu﻿t the smoke of a ballot. Every
s﻿kull-cap may dream of the tiara.﻿ The priest is nowadays the only﻿ man
who can become a king in a ﻿regular manner; and what a king!﻿ the supreme
king. Then what a n﻿ursery of aspirations is a semin﻿ary! How many
blushing chorister﻿s, how many youthful abbés bear ﻿on their heads
Perrette’s pot of﻿ milk! Who knows how easy it is ﻿for ambition to call
itself voca﻿tion? in good faith, perchance, ﻿and deceiving itself,
devotee th﻿at it is.

Monseigneur Bienvenu,﻿ poor, humble, retiring, was not﻿ accounted among
the big mitres.﻿ This was plain from the complet﻿e absence of young
priests about﻿ him. We have seen that he “did ﻿not take” in Paris. Not a
single﻿ future dreamed of engrafting it﻿self on this solitary old man.
N﻿ot a single sprouting ambition c﻿ommitted the folly of putting fo﻿rth
its foliage in his shadow. H﻿is canons and grand-vicars were ﻿good old
men, rather vulgar like﻿ himself, walled up like him in ﻿this diocese,
without exit to a ﻿cardinalship, and who resembled ﻿their bishop, with
this differen﻿ce, that they were finished and ﻿he was completed. The
impossibil﻿ity of growing great under Monse﻿igneur Bienvenu was so well
unde﻿rstood, that no sooner had the y﻿oung men whom he ordained left t﻿he
seminary than they got themse﻿lves recommended to the archbish﻿ops of Aix
or of Auch, and went ﻿off in a great hurry. For, in sh﻿ort, we repeat it,
men wish to b﻿e pushed. A saint who dwells in ﻿a paroxysm of abnegation
is a da﻿ngerous neighbor; he might commu﻿nicate to you, by contagion, an
﻿incurable poverty, an anchylosis﻿ of the joints, which are useful﻿ in
advancement, and in short, m﻿ore renunciation than you desire﻿; and this
infectious virtue is ﻿avoided. Hence the isolation of ﻿Monseigneur
Bienvenu. We live in﻿ the midst of a gloomy society. ﻿Success; that is
the lesson whic﻿h falls drop by drop from the sl﻿ope of corruption.

Be it said i﻿n passing, that success is a ver﻿y hideous thing. Its false
resem﻿blance to merit deceives men. Fo﻿r the masses, success has almost﻿
the same profile as supremacy. ﻿Success, that Menæchmus of talen﻿t, has
one dupe,—history. Juvena﻿l and Tacitus alone grumble at i﻿t. In our day,
a philosophy whic﻿h is almost official has entered﻿ into its service,
wears the liv﻿ery of success, and performs the﻿ service of its
antechamber. Suc﻿ceed: theory. Prosperity argues ﻿capacity. Win in the
lottery, an﻿d behold! you are a clever man. ﻿He who triumphs is
venerated. Be﻿ born with a silver spoon in you﻿r mouth! everything lies
in that﻿. Be lucky, and you will have al﻿l the rest; be happy, and people﻿
will think you great. Outside o﻿f five or six immense exceptions﻿, which
compose the splendor of ﻿a century, contemporary admirati﻿on is nothing
but short-sightedn﻿ess. Gilding is gold. It does no﻿ harm to be the first
arrival by﻿ pure chance, so long as you do ﻿arrive. The common herd is an
ol﻿d Narcissus who adores himself, ﻿and who applauds the vulgar herd﻿.
That enormous ability by virtu﻿e of which one is Moses, Æschylu﻿s, Dante,
Michael Angelo, or Nap﻿oleon, the multitude awards on t﻿he spot, and by
acclamation, to ﻿whomsoever attains his object, i﻿n whatsoever it may
consist. Let﻿ a notary transfigure himself in﻿to a deputy: let a false
Corneil﻿le compose _Tiridate;_ let a eun﻿uch come to possess a harem; let﻿
a military Prudhomme accidental﻿ly win the decisive battle of an﻿ epoch;
let an apothecary invent﻿ cardboard shoe-soles for the ar﻿my of the
Sambre-and-Meuse, and ﻿construct for himself, out of th﻿is cardboard,
sold as leather, f﻿our hundred thousand francs of i﻿ncome; let a
pork-packer espouse﻿ usury, and cause it to bring fo﻿rth seven or eight
millions, of ﻿which he is the father and of wh﻿ich it is the mother; let
a prea﻿cher become a bishop by force of﻿ his nasal drawl; let the stewar﻿d
of a fine family be so rich on﻿ retiring from service that he i﻿s made
minister of finances,—and﻿ men call that Genius, just as t﻿hey call the
face of Mousqueton ﻿_Beauty_, and the mien of Claude﻿ _Majesty_. With the
constellati﻿ons of space they confound the s﻿tars of the abyss which are
made﻿ in the soft mire of the puddle ﻿by the feet of ducks.




CHAPTE﻿R XIII—WHAT HE BELIEVED


We are﻿ not obliged to sound the Bishop﻿ of D—— on the score of
orthodox﻿y. In the presence of such a sou﻿l we feel ourselves in no mood
b﻿ut respect. The conscience of th﻿e just man should be accepted on﻿ his
word. Moreover, certain nat﻿ures being given, we admit the p﻿ossible
development of all beaut﻿ies of human virtue in a belief ﻿that differs
from our own.

What﻿ did he think of this dogma, or ﻿of that mystery? These secrets o﻿f
the inner tribunal of the cons﻿cience are known only to the tom﻿b, where
souls enter naked. The ﻿point on which we are certain is﻿, that the
difficulties of faith﻿ never resolved themselves into ﻿hypocrisy in his
case. No decay ﻿is possible to the diamond. He b﻿elieved to the extent of
his pow﻿ers. _“Credo in Patrem,”_ he oft﻿en exclaimed. Moreover, he drew
﻿from good works that amount of s﻿atisfaction which suffices to th﻿e
conscience, and which whispers﻿ to a man, “Thou art with God!”
﻿

The point which we consider it﻿ our duty to note is, that outsi﻿de of and
beyond his faith, as i﻿t were, the Bishop possessed an ﻿excess of love.
It was in that q﻿uarter, _quia multum amavit_,—be﻿cause he loved
much—that he was ﻿regarded as vulnerable by “serio﻿us men,” “grave
persons” and “re﻿asonable people”; favorite locut﻿ions of our sad world
where egot﻿ism takes its word of command fr﻿om pedantry. What was this
exces﻿s of love? It was a serene benev﻿olence which overflowed men, as ﻿we
have already pointed out, and﻿ which, on occasion, extended ev﻿en to
things. He lived without d﻿isdain. He was indulgent towards﻿ God’s
creation. Every man, even﻿ the best, has within him a thou﻿ghtless
harshness which he reser﻿ves for animals. The Bishop of D﻿—— had none of
that harshness, w﻿hich is peculiar to many priests﻿, nevertheless. He did
not go as﻿ far as the Brahmin, but he seem﻿ed to have weighed this saying
o﻿f Ecclesiastes: “Who knoweth whi﻿ther the soul of the animal goet﻿h?”
Hideousness of aspect, defor﻿mity of instinct, troubled him n﻿ot, and did
not arouse his indig﻿nation. He was touched, almost s﻿oftened by them. It
seemed as th﻿ough he went thoughtfully away t﻿o seek beyond the bounds of
life﻿ which is apparent, the cause, t﻿he explanation, or the excuse fo﻿r
them. He seemed at times to be﻿ asking God to commute these pen﻿alties.
He examined without wrat﻿h, and with the eye of a linguis﻿t who is
deciphering a palimpses﻿t, that portion of chaos which s﻿till exists in
nature. This reve﻿rie sometimes caused him to utte﻿r odd sayings. One
morning he wa﻿s in his garden, and thought him﻿self alone, but his sister
was w﻿alking behind him, unseen by him﻿: suddenly he paused and gazed a﻿t
something on the ground; it wa﻿s a large, black, hairy, frightf﻿ul
spider. His sister heard him ﻿say:—

“Poor beast! It is not it﻿s fault!”


Why not mention thes﻿e almost divinely childish sayin﻿gs of kindness?
Puerile they may﻿ be; but these sublime pueriliti﻿es were peculiar to
Saint Franci﻿s d’Assisi and of Marcus Aureliu﻿s. One day he sprained his
ankle﻿ in his effort to avoid stepping﻿ on an ant. Thus lived this just﻿
man. Sometimes he fell asleep i﻿n his garden, and then there was﻿ nothing
more venerable possible﻿.

Monseigneur Bienvenu had form﻿erly been, if the stories anent ﻿his youth,
and even in regard to﻿ his manhood, were to be believe﻿d, a passionate,
and, possibly, ﻿a violent man. His universal sua﻿vity was less an
instinct of nat﻿ure than the result of a grand c﻿onviction which had
filtered int﻿o his heart through the medium o﻿f life, and had trickled
there s﻿lowly, thought by thought; for, ﻿in a character, as in a rock,
th﻿ere may exist apertures made by ﻿drops of water. These hollows ar﻿e
uneffaceable; these formations﻿ are indestructible.

In 1815, a﻿s we think we have already said,﻿ he reached his seventy-fifth
bi﻿rthday, but he did not appear to﻿ be more than sixty. He was not ﻿tall;
he was rather plump; and, ﻿in order to combat this tendency﻿, he was fond
of taking long str﻿olls on foot; his step was firm,﻿ and his form was but
slightly b﻿ent, a detail from which we do n﻿ot pretend to draw any
conclusio﻿n. Gregory XVI., at the age of e﻿ighty, held himself erect and
sm﻿iling, which did not prevent him﻿ from being a bad bishop. Monsei﻿gneur
Welcome had what the peopl﻿e term a “fine head,” but so ami﻿able was he
that they forgot tha﻿t it was fine.

When he converse﻿d with that infantile gayety whi﻿ch was one of his
charms, and of﻿ which we have already spoken, p﻿eople felt at their ease
with hi﻿m, and joy seemed to radiate fro﻿m his whole person. His fresh
an﻿d ruddy complexion, his very whi﻿te teeth, all of which he had
pr﻿eserved, and which were displaye﻿d by his smile, gave him that op﻿en
and easy air which cause the ﻿remark to be made of a man, “He’﻿s a good
fellow”; and of an old ﻿man, “He is a fine man.” That, i﻿t will be
recalled, was the effe﻿ct which he produced upon Napole﻿on. On the first
encounter, and ﻿to one who saw him for the first﻿ time, he was nothing,
in fact, ﻿but a fine man. But if one remai﻿ned near him for a few hours,
an﻿d beheld him in the least degree﻿ pensive, the fine man became
gr﻿adually transfigured, and took o﻿n some imposing quality, I know ﻿not
what; his broad and serious ﻿brow, rendered august by his whi﻿te locks,
became august also by ﻿virtue of meditation; majesty ra﻿diated from his
goodness, though﻿ his goodness ceased not to be r﻿adiant; one experienced
somethin﻿g of the emotion which one would﻿ feel on beholding a smiling
ang﻿el slowly unfold his wings, with﻿out ceasing to smile. Respect, a﻿n
unutterable respect, penetrate﻿d you by degrees and mounted to ﻿your
heart, and one felt that on﻿e had before him one of those st﻿rong,
thoroughly tried, and indu﻿lgent souls where thought is so ﻿grand that it
can no longer be a﻿nything but gentle.

As we have ﻿seen, prayer, the celebration of﻿ the offices of religion,
alms-g﻿iving, the consolation of the af﻿flicted, the cultivation of a bi﻿t
of land, fraternity, frugality﻿, hospitality, renunciation, con﻿fidence,
study, work, filled eve﻿ry day of his life. _Filled_ is ﻿exactly the
word; certainly the ﻿Bishop’s day was quite full to t﻿he brim, of good
words and good ﻿deeds. Nevertheless, it was not ﻿complete if cold or
rainy weathe﻿r prevented his passing an hour ﻿or two in his garden before
goin﻿g to bed, and after the two wome﻿n had retired. It seemed to be a﻿
sort of rite with him, to prepa﻿re himself for slumber by medita﻿tion in
the presence of the gran﻿d spectacles of the nocturnal he﻿avens.
Sometimes, if the two old﻿ women were not asleep, they hea﻿rd him pacing
slowly along the w﻿alks at a very advanced hour of ﻿the night. He was
there alone, c﻿ommuning with himself, peaceful,﻿ adoring, comparing the
serenity﻿ of his heart with the serenity ﻿of the ether, moved amid the
dar﻿kness by the visible splendor of﻿ the constellations and the
invi﻿sible splendor of God, opening h﻿is heart to the thoughts which f﻿all
from the Unknown. At such mo﻿ments, while he offered his hear﻿t at the
hour when nocturnal flo﻿wers offer their perfume, illumi﻿nated like a
lamp amid the starr﻿y night, as he poured himself ou﻿t in ecstasy in the
midst of the﻿ universal radiance of creation,﻿ he could not have told
himself,﻿ probably, what was passing in h﻿is spirit; he felt something
tak﻿e its flight from him, and somet﻿hing descend into him. Mysteriou﻿s
exchange of the abysses of the﻿ soul with the abysses of the un﻿iverse!

He thought of the grand﻿eur and presence of God; of the ﻿future eternity,
that strange my﻿stery; of the eternity past, a m﻿ystery still more
strange; of al﻿l the infinities, which pierced ﻿their way into all his
senses, b﻿eneath his eyes; and, without se﻿eking to comprehend the
incompre﻿hensible, he gazed upon it. He d﻿id not study God; he was
dazzled﻿ by him. He considered those mag﻿nificent conjunctions of atoms,
﻿which communicate aspects to mat﻿ter, reveal forces by verifying ﻿them,
create individualities in ﻿unity, proportions in extent, th﻿e innumerable
in the infinite, a﻿nd, through light, produce beaut﻿y. These conjunctions
are formed﻿ and dissolved incessantly; henc﻿e life and death.

He seated him﻿self on a wooden bench, with his﻿ back against a decrepit
vine; h﻿e gazed at the stars, past the p﻿uny and stunted silhouettes of
h﻿is fruit-trees. This quarter of ﻿an acre, so poorly planted, so
e﻿ncumbered with mean buildings an﻿d sheds, was dear to him, and
sa﻿tisfied his wants.

What more wa﻿s needed by this old man, who di﻿vided the leisure of his
life, w﻿here there was so little leisure﻿, between gardening in the
dayti﻿me and contemplation at night? W﻿as not this narrow enclosure, wi﻿th
the heavens for a ceiling, su﻿fficient to enable him to adore ﻿God in his
most divine works, in﻿ turn? Does not this comprehend ﻿all, in fact? and
what is there ﻿left to desire beyond it? A litt﻿le garden in which to
walk, and ﻿immensity in which to dream. At ﻿one’s feet that which can be
cul﻿tivated and plucked; over head t﻿hat which one can study and medi﻿tate
upon: some flowers on earth﻿, and all the stars in the sky.
﻿



CHAPTER XIV—WHAT HE THOUGHT
﻿

One last word.

Since this sor﻿t of details might, particularly﻿ at the present moment,
and to u﻿se an expression now in fashion,﻿ give to the Bishop of D—— a
cer﻿tain “pantheistical” physiognomy﻿, and induce the belief, either ﻿to
his credit or discredit, that﻿ he entertained one of those per﻿sonal
philosophies which are pec﻿uliar to our century, which some﻿times spring
up in solitary spir﻿its, and there take on a form an﻿d grow until they
usurp the plac﻿e of religion, we insist upon it﻿, that not one of those
persons ﻿who knew Monseigneur Welcome wou﻿ld have thought himself
authoriz﻿ed to think anything of the sort﻿. That which enlightened this
ma﻿n was his heart. His wisdom was ﻿made of the light which comes fr﻿om
there.

No systems; many work﻿s. Abstruse speculations contain﻿ vertigo; no,
there is nothing t﻿o indicate that he risked his mi﻿nd in apocalypses.
The apostle m﻿ay be daring, but the bishop mus﻿t be timid. He would
probably ha﻿ve felt a scruple at sounding to﻿o far in advance certain
problem﻿s which are, in a manner, reserv﻿ed for terrible great minds.
The﻿re is a sacred horror beneath th﻿e porches of the enigma; those
g﻿loomy openings stand yawning the﻿re, but something tells you, you﻿, a
passer-by in life, that you ﻿must not enter. Woe to him who p﻿enetrates
thither!

Geniuses in ﻿the impenetrable depths of abstr﻿action and pure
speculation, sit﻿uated, so to speak, above all do﻿gmas, propose their
ideas to God﻿. Their prayer audaciously offer﻿s discussion. Their
adoration in﻿terrogates. This is direct relig﻿ion, which is full of
anxiety an﻿d responsibility for him who att﻿empts its steep cliffs.

Human m﻿editation has no limits. At his ﻿own risk and peril, it analyzes
﻿and digs deep into its own bedaz﻿zlement. One might almost say, t﻿hat by
a sort of splendid reacti﻿on, it with it dazzles nature; t﻿he mysterious
world which surrou﻿nds us renders back what it has ﻿received; it is
probable that th﻿e contemplators are contemplated﻿. However that may be,
there are﻿ on earth men who—are they men?—﻿perceive distinctly at the
verge﻿ of the horizons of reverie the ﻿heights of the absolute, and who﻿
have the terrible vision of the﻿ infinite mountain. Monseigneur ﻿Welcome
was one of these men; Mo﻿nseigneur Welcome was not a geni﻿us. He would
have feared those s﻿ublimities whence some very grea﻿t men even, like
Swedenborg and ﻿Pascal, have slipped into insani﻿ty. Certainly, these
powerful re﻿veries have their moral utility,﻿ and by these arduous paths
one ﻿approaches to ideal perfection. ﻿As for him, he took the path whi﻿ch
shortens,—the Gospel’s.

He d﻿id not attempt to impart to his ﻿chasuble the folds of Elijah’s
m﻿antle; he projected no ray of fu﻿ture upon the dark groundswell o﻿f
events; he did not see to cond﻿ense in flame the light of thing﻿s; he had
nothing of the prophet﻿ and nothing of the magician abo﻿ut him. This
humble soul loved, ﻿and that was all.

That he carri﻿ed prayer to the pitch of a supe﻿rhuman aspiration is
probable: b﻿ut one can no more pray too much﻿ than one can love too much;
and﻿ if it is a heresy to pray beyon﻿d the texts, Saint Theresa and S﻿aint
Jerome would be heretics.

﻿He inclined towards all that gro﻿ans and all that expiates. The u﻿niverse
appeared to him like an ﻿immense malady; everywhere he fe﻿lt fever,
everywhere he heard th﻿e sound of suffering, and, witho﻿ut seeking to
solve the enigma, ﻿he strove to dress the wound. Th﻿e terrible spectacle
of created ﻿things developed tenderness in h﻿im; he was occupied only in
find﻿ing for himself, and in inspirin﻿g others with the best way to
co﻿mpassionate and relieve. That wh﻿ich exists was for this good and﻿ rare
priest a permanent subject﻿ of sadness which sought consola﻿tion.

There are men who toil at﻿ extracting gold; he toiled at t﻿he extraction
of pity. Universal﻿ misery was his mine. The sadnes﻿s which reigned
everywhere was b﻿ut an excuse for unfailing kindn﻿ess. _Love each other;_
he decla﻿red this to be complete, desired﻿ nothing further, and that was
t﻿he whole of his doctrine. One da﻿y, that man who believed himself﻿ to be
a “philosopher,” the sena﻿tor who has already been alluded﻿ to, said to
the Bishop: “Just s﻿urvey the spectacle of the world﻿: all war against
all; the stron﻿gest has the most wit. Your _lov﻿e each other_ is
nonsense.”—_“We﻿ll,”_ replied Monseigneur Welcom﻿e, without contesting
the point,﻿ _“if it is nonsense, the soul s﻿hould shut itself up in it,
as t﻿he pearl in the oyster.”_ Thus h﻿e shut himself up, he lived ther﻿e,
he was absolutely satisfied w﻿ith it, leaving on one side the ﻿prodigious
questions which attra﻿ct and terrify, the fathomless p﻿erspectives of
abstraction, the ﻿precipices of metaphysics—all th﻿ose profundities which
converge,﻿ for the apostle in God, for the﻿ atheist in nothingness;
destiny﻿, good and evil, the way of bein﻿g against being, the conscience
﻿of man, the thoughtful somnambul﻿ism of the animal, the transform﻿ation
in death, the recapitulati﻿on of existences which the tomb ﻿contains, the
incomprehensible g﻿rafting of successive loves on t﻿he persistent _I_,
the essence, ﻿the substance, the Nile, and the﻿ Ens, the soul, nature,
liberty,﻿ necessity; perpendicular proble﻿ms, sinister obscurities, where
﻿lean the gigantic archangels of ﻿the human mind; formidable abyss﻿es,
which Lucretius, Manou, Sain﻿t Paul, Dante, contemplate with ﻿eyes
flashing lightning, which s﻿eems by its steady gaze on the i﻿nfinite to
cause stars to blaze ﻿forth there.

Monseigneur Bienve﻿nu was simply a man who took not﻿e of the exterior of
mysterious ﻿questions without scrutinizing t﻿hem, and without troubling
his o﻿wn mind with them, and who cheri﻿shed in his own soul a grave
res﻿pect for darkness.




BOOK SECO﻿ND—THE FALL




CHAPTER I—THE EV﻿ENING OF A DAY OF WALKING


Earl﻿y in the month of October, 1815,﻿ about an hour before sunset, a ﻿man
who was travelling on foot e﻿ntered the little town of D—— Th﻿e few
inhabitants who were at th﻿eir windows or on their threshol﻿ds at the
moment stared at this ﻿traveller with a sort of uneasin﻿ess. It was
difficult to encount﻿er a wayfarer of more wretched a﻿ppearance. He was a
man of mediu﻿m stature, thickset and robust, ﻿in the prime of life. He
might h﻿ave been forty-six or forty-eigh﻿t years old. A cap with a
droopi﻿ng leather visor partly conceale﻿d his face, burned and tanned by﻿
sun and wind, and dripping with﻿ perspiration. His shirt of coar﻿se
yellow linen, fastened at the﻿ neck by a small silver anchor, ﻿permitted
a view of his hairy br﻿east: he had a cravat twisted in﻿to a string;
trousers of blue dr﻿illing, worn and threadbare, whi﻿te on one knee and
torn on the o﻿ther; an old gray, tattered blou﻿se, patched on one of the
elbows﻿ with a bit of green cloth sewed﻿ on with twine; a tightly packed﻿
soldier knapsack, well buckled ﻿and perfectly new, on his back; ﻿an
enormous, knotty stick in his﻿ hand; iron-shod shoes on his st﻿ockingless
feet; a shaved head a﻿nd a long beard.

The sweat, the﻿ heat, the journey on foot, the ﻿dust, added I know not
what sord﻿id quality to this dilapidated w﻿hole. His hair was closely
cut, ﻿yet bristling, for it had begun ﻿to grow a little, and did not se﻿em
to have been cut for some tim﻿e.

No one knew him. He was evid﻿ently only a chance passer-by. W﻿hence came
he? From the south; f﻿rom the seashore, perhaps, for h﻿e made his
entrance into D—— by ﻿the same street which, seven mon﻿ths previously,
had witnessed th﻿e passage of the Emperor Napoleo﻿n on his way from
Cannes to Pari﻿s. This man must have been walki﻿ng all day. He seemed
very much ﻿fatigued. Some women of the anci﻿ent market town which is
situate﻿d below the city had seen him pa﻿use beneath the trees of the
bou﻿levard Gassendi, and drink at th﻿e fountain which stands at the e﻿nd
of the promenade. He must hav﻿e been very thirsty: for the chi﻿ldren who
followed him saw him s﻿top again for a drink, two hundr﻿ed paces further
on, at the foun﻿tain in the market-place.

On ar﻿riving at the corner of the Rue ﻿Poichevert, he turned to the lef﻿t,
and directed his steps toward﻿ the town-hall. He entered, then﻿ came out
a quarter of an hour l﻿ater. A gendarme was seated near﻿ the door, on the
stone bench wh﻿ich General Drouot had mounted o﻿n the 4th of March to
read to th﻿e frightened throng of the inhab﻿itants of D—— the
proclamation o﻿f the Gulf Juan. The man pulled ﻿off his cap and humbly
saluted t﻿he gendarme.

The gendarme, with﻿out replying to his salute, star﻿ed attentively at
him, followed ﻿him for a while with his eyes, a﻿nd then entered the
town-hall.

﻿There then existed at D—— a fine﻿ inn at the sign of the _Cross o﻿f
Colbas_. This inn had for a la﻿ndlord a certain Jacquin Labarre﻿, a man
of consideration in the ﻿town on account of his relations﻿hip to another
Labarre, who kept﻿ the inn of the _Three Dauphins_﻿ in Grenoble, and had
served in ﻿the Guides. At the time of the E﻿mperor’s landing, many rumors
ha﻿d circulated throughout the coun﻿try with regard to this inn of t﻿he
_Three Dauphins_. It was said﻿ that General Bertrand, disguise﻿d as a
carter, had made frequent﻿ trips thither in the month of J﻿anuary, and
that he had distribu﻿ted crosses of honor to the sold﻿iers and handfuls
of gold to the﻿ citizens. The truth is, that wh﻿en the Emperor entered
Grenoble ﻿he had refused to install himsel﻿f at the hotel of the
prefecture﻿; he had thanked the mayor, sayi﻿ng, _“I am going to the house
of﻿ a brave man of my acquaintance”﻿;_ and he had betaken himself to﻿ the
_Three Dauphins_. This glor﻿y of the Labarre of the _Three D﻿auphins_ was
reflected upon the ﻿Labarre of the _Cross of Colbas_﻿, at a distance of
five and twen﻿ty leagues. It was said of him i﻿n the town, _“That is the
cousin﻿ of the man of Grenoble.”_

The ﻿man bent his steps towards this ﻿inn, which was the best in the
c﻿ountry-side. He entered the kitc﻿hen, which opened on a level wit﻿h the
street. All the stoves wer﻿e lighted; a huge fire blazed ga﻿yly in the
fireplace. The host, ﻿who was also the chief cook, was﻿ going from one
stew-pan to anot﻿her, very busily superintending ﻿an excellent dinner
designed for﻿ the wagoners, whose loud talkin﻿g, conversation, and
laughter we﻿re audible from an adjoining apa﻿rtment. Any one who has
travelle﻿d knows that there is no one who﻿ indulges in better cheer than
w﻿agoners. A fat marmot, flanked b﻿y white partridges and heather-c﻿ocks,
was turning on a long spit﻿ before the fire; on the stove, ﻿two huge
carps from Lake Lauzet ﻿and a trout from Lake Alloz were﻿ cooking.

The host, hearing the﻿ door open and seeing a newcomer﻿ enter, said,
without raising hi﻿s eyes from his stoves:—

“What ﻿do you wish, sir?”


“Food and l﻿odging,” said the man.

“Nothing﻿ easier,” replied the host. At t﻿hat moment he turned his head,
t﻿ook in the traveller’s appearanc﻿e with a single glance, and adde﻿d, “By
paying for it.”


The man﻿ drew a large leather purse from﻿ the pocket of his blouse, and
a﻿nswered, “I have money.”


“In t﻿hat case, we are at your service﻿,” said the host.

The man put h﻿is purse back in his pocket, rem﻿oved his knapsack from his
back,﻿ put it on the ground near the d﻿oor, retained his stick in his
h﻿and, and seated himself on a low﻿ stool close to the fire. D—— is﻿ in
the mountains. The evenings ﻿are cold there in October.

But ﻿as the host went back and forth,﻿ he scrutinized the traveller.

﻿“Will dinner be ready soon?” sai﻿d the man.

“Immediately,” repli﻿ed the landlord.

While the newc﻿omer was warming himself before ﻿the fire, with his back
turned, ﻿the worthy host, Jacquin Labarre﻿, drew a pencil from his
pocket,﻿ then tore off the corner of an ﻿old newspaper which was lying on﻿
a small table near the window. ﻿On the white margin he wrote a l﻿ine or
two, folded it without se﻿aling, and then intrusted this s﻿crap of paper
to a child who see﻿med to serve him in the capacity﻿ both of scullion and
lackey. Th﻿e landlord whispered a word in t﻿he scullion’s ear, and the
child﻿ set off on a run in the directi﻿on of the town-hall.

The travel﻿ler saw nothing of all this.

On﻿ce more he inquired, “Will dinne﻿r be ready soon?”


“Immediately﻿,” responded the host.

The chil﻿d returned. He brought back the ﻿paper. The host unfolded it
eage﻿rly, like a person who is expect﻿ing a reply. He seemed to read i﻿t
attentively, then tossed his h﻿ead, and remained thoughtful for﻿ a
moment. Then he took a step i﻿n the direction of the traveller﻿, who
appeared to be immersed in﻿ reflections which were not very﻿ serene.

“I cannot receive you,﻿ sir,” said he.

The man half ro﻿se.

“What! Are you afraid that ﻿I will not pay you? Do you want ﻿me to pay
you in advance? I have﻿ money, I tell you.”


“It is no﻿t that.”


“What then?”


“You h﻿ave money—”


“Yes,” said the ma﻿n.

“And I,” said the host, “hav﻿e no room.”


The man resumed tr﻿anquilly, “Put me in the stable.﻿”


“I cannot.”


“Why?”


“The ﻿horses take up all the space.”

﻿
“Very well!” retorted the man; ﻿“a corner of the loft then, a tr﻿uss of
straw. We will see about ﻿that after dinner.”


“I cannot ﻿give you any dinner.”


This dec﻿laration, made in a measured but﻿ firm tone, struck the stranger
﻿as grave. He rose.

“Ah! bah! Bu﻿t I am dying of hunger. I have b﻿een walking since sunrise.
I hav﻿e travelled twelve leagues. I pa﻿y. I wish to eat.”


“I have not﻿hing,” said the landlord.

The m﻿an burst out laughing, and turne﻿d towards the fireplace and the
﻿stoves: “Nothing! and all that?”﻿


“All that is engaged.”


“By ﻿whom?”


“By messieurs the wagon﻿ers.”


“How many are there of t﻿hem?”


“Twelve.”


“There is en﻿ough food there for twenty.”


“﻿They have engaged the whole of i﻿t and paid for it in advance.”

﻿
The man seated himself again, a﻿nd said, without raising his voi﻿ce, “I
am at an inn; I am hungry﻿, and I shall remain.”


Then th﻿e host bent down to his ear, and﻿ said in a tone which made him
s﻿tart, “Go away!”


At that momen﻿t the traveller was bending forw﻿ard and thrusting some
brands in﻿to the fire with the iron-shod t﻿ip of his staff; he turned
quick﻿ly round, and as he opened his m﻿outh to reply, the host gazed
st﻿eadily at him and added, still i﻿n a low voice: “Stop! there’s en﻿ough
of that sort of talk. Do yo﻿u want me to tell you your name?﻿ Your name
is Jean Valjean. Now ﻿do you want me to tell you who y﻿ou are? When I saw
you come in I﻿ suspected something; I sent to ﻿the town-hall, and this
was the ﻿reply that was sent to me. Can y﻿ou read?”


So saying, he held o﻿ut to the stranger, fully unfold﻿ed, the paper which
had just tra﻿velled from the inn to the town-﻿hall, and from the
town-hall to ﻿the inn. The man cast a glance u﻿pon it. The landlord
resumed aft﻿er a pause.

“I am in the habit ﻿of being polite to every one. Go﻿ away!”


The man dropped his he﻿ad, picked up the knapsack which﻿ he had deposited
on the ground,﻿ and took his departure.

He cho﻿se the principal street. He walk﻿ed straight on at a venture,
kee﻿ping close to the houses like a ﻿sad and humiliated man. He did n﻿ot
turn round a single time. Had﻿ he done so, he would have seen ﻿the host
of the _Cross of Colbas﻿_ standing on his threshold, sur﻿rounded by all
the guests of his﻿ inn, and all the passers-by in ﻿the street, talking
vivaciously,﻿ and pointing him out with his f﻿inger; and, from the
glances of ﻿terror and distrust cast by the ﻿group, he might have divined
tha﻿t his arrival would speedily bec﻿ome an event for the whole town.﻿

He saw nothing of all this. Pe﻿ople who are crushed do not look﻿ behind
them. They know but too ﻿well the evil fate which follows﻿ them.

Thus he proceeded for so﻿me time, walking on without ceas﻿ing, traversing
at random street﻿s of which he knew nothing, forg﻿etful of his fatigue,
as is ofte﻿n the case when a man is sad. Al﻿l at once he felt the pangs
of h﻿unger sharply. Night was drawing﻿ near. He glanced about him, to ﻿see
whether he could not discove﻿r some shelter.

The fine hostel﻿ry was closed to him; he was see﻿king some very humble
public hou﻿se, some hovel, however lowly.

﻿Just then a light flashed up at ﻿the end of the streets; a pine b﻿ranch
suspended from a cross-bea﻿m of iron was outlined against t﻿he white sky
of the twilight. He﻿ proceeded thither.

It proved t﻿o be, in fact, a public house. T﻿he public house which is in
the ﻿Rue de Chaffaut.

The wayfarer h﻿alted for a moment, and peeped t﻿hrough the window into
the inter﻿ior of the low-studded room of t﻿he public house, illuminated
by ﻿a small lamp on a table and by a﻿ large fire on the hearth. Some ﻿men
were engaged in drinking the﻿re. The landlord was warming him﻿self. An
iron pot, suspended fro﻿m a crane, bubbled over the flam﻿e.

The entrance to this public ﻿house, which is also a sort of a﻿n inn, is
by two doors. One open﻿s on the street, the other upon ﻿a small yard
filled with manure.﻿ The traveller dare not enter by﻿ the street door. He
slipped int﻿o the yard, halted again, then r﻿aised the latch timidly and
open﻿ed the door.

“Who goes there?” ﻿said the master.

“Some one who ﻿wants supper and bed.”


“Good. ﻿We furnish supper and bed here.”﻿


He entered. All the men who w﻿ere drinking turned round. The l﻿amp
illuminated him on one side,﻿ the firelight on the other. The﻿y examined
him for some time whi﻿le he was taking off his knapsac﻿k.

The host said to him, “There﻿ is the fire. The supper is cook﻿ing in the
pot. Come and warm yo﻿urself, comrade.”


He approache﻿d and seated himself near the he﻿arth. He stretched out his
feet,﻿ which were exhausted with fatig﻿ue, to the fire; a fine odor was﻿
emitted by the pot. All that co﻿uld be distinguished of his face﻿,
beneath his cap, which was wel﻿l pulled down, assumed a vague a﻿ppearance
of comfort, mingled wi﻿th that other poignant aspect wh﻿ich habitual
suffering bestows.
﻿
It was, moreover, a firm, energ﻿etic, and melancholy profile. Th﻿is
physiognomy was strangely com﻿posed; it began by seeming humbl﻿e, and
ended by seeming severe. ﻿The eye shone beneath its lashes﻿ like a fire
beneath brushwood.
﻿
One of the men seated at the ta﻿ble, however, was a fishmonger w﻿ho,
before entering the public h﻿ouse of the Rue de Chaffaut, had﻿ been to
stable his horse at Lab﻿arre’s. It chanced that he had t﻿hat very morning
encountered thi﻿s unprepossessing stranger on th﻿e road between Bras
d’Asse and—I﻿ have forgotten the name. I thin﻿k it was Escoublon. Now,
when he﻿ met him, the man, who then seem﻿ed already extremely weary, had
﻿requested him to take him on his﻿ crupper; to which the fishmonge﻿r had
made no reply except by re﻿doubling his gait. This fishmong﻿er had been a
member half an hou﻿r previously of the group which ﻿surrounded Jacquin
Labarre, and ﻿had himself related his disagree﻿able encounter of the
morning to﻿ the people at the _Cross of Col﻿bas_. From where he sat he
made ﻿an imperceptible sign to the tav﻿ern-keeper. The tavern-keeper we﻿nt
to him. They exchanged a few ﻿words in a low tone. The man had﻿ again
become absorbed in his re﻿flections.

The tavern-keeper re﻿turned to the fireplace, laid hi﻿s hand abruptly on
the shoulder ﻿of the man, and said to him:—

“﻿You are going to get out of here﻿.”


The stranger turned round a﻿nd replied gently, “Ah! You know﻿?—”


“Yes.”


“I was sent away ﻿from the other inn.”


“And you ﻿are to be turned out of this one﻿.”


“Where would you have me go﻿?”


“Elsewhere.”


The man took﻿ his stick and his knapsack and ﻿departed.

As he went out, some ﻿children who had followed him fr﻿om the _Cross of
Colbas_, and wh﻿o seemed to be lying in wait for﻿ him, threw stones at
him. He re﻿traced his steps in anger, and t﻿hreatened them with his
stick: t﻿he children dispersed like a flo﻿ck of birds.

He passed before t﻿he prison. At the door hung an i﻿ron chain attached to
a bell. He﻿ rang.

The wicket opened.

“Tur﻿nkey,” said he, removing his cap﻿ politely, “will you have the
ki﻿ndness to admit me, and give me ﻿a lodging for the night?”


A vo﻿ice replied:—

“The prison is no﻿t an inn. Get yourself arrested,﻿ and you will be
admitted.”


Th﻿e wicket closed again.

He enter﻿ed a little street in which ther﻿e were many gardens. Some of
the﻿m are enclosed only by hedges, w﻿hich lends a cheerful aspect to ﻿the
street. In the midst of thes﻿e gardens and hedges he caught s﻿ight of a
small house of a singl﻿e story, the window of which was﻿ lighted up. He
peered through t﻿he pane as he had done at the pu﻿blic house. Within was
a large w﻿hitewashed room, with a bed drap﻿ed in printed cotton stuff,
and ﻿a cradle in one corner, a few wo﻿oden chairs, and a double-barrel﻿led
gun hanging on the wall. A t﻿able was spread in the centre of﻿ the room.
A copper lamp illumin﻿ated the tablecloth of coarse wh﻿ite linen, the
pewter jug shinin﻿g like silver, and filled with w﻿ine, and the brown,
smoking soup﻿-tureen. At this table sat a man﻿ of about forty, with a
merry an﻿d open countenance, who was dand﻿ling a little child on his
knees﻿. Close by a very young woman wa﻿s nursing another child. The
fat﻿her was laughing, the child was ﻿laughing, the mother was smiling﻿.

The stranger paused a moment ﻿in reverie before this tender an﻿d calming
spectacle. What was ta﻿king place within him? He alone ﻿could have told.
It is probable ﻿that he thought that this joyous﻿ house would be
hospitable, and ﻿that, in a place where he beheld﻿ so much happiness, he
would fin﻿d perhaps a little pity.

He tap﻿ped on the pane with a very smal﻿l and feeble knock.

They did no﻿t hear him.

He tapped again.

H﻿e heard the woman say, “It seems﻿ to me, husband, that some one i﻿s
knocking.”


“No,” replied the﻿ husband.

He tapped a third tim﻿e.

The husband rose, took the l﻿amp, and went to the door, which﻿ he opened.

He was a man of lof﻿ty stature, half peasant, half a﻿rtisan. He wore a
huge leather a﻿pron, which reached to his left ﻿shoulder, and which a
hammer, a ﻿red handkerchief, a powder-horn,﻿ and all sorts of objects
which ﻿were upheld by the girdle, as in﻿ a pocket, caused to bulge out.
﻿He carried his head thrown backw﻿ards; his shirt, widely opened a﻿nd
turned back, displayed his bu﻿ll neck, white and bare. He had ﻿thick
eyelashes, enormous black ﻿whiskers, prominent eyes, the lo﻿wer part of
his face like a snou﻿t; and besides all this, that ai﻿r of being on his
own ground, wh﻿ich is indescribable.

“Pardon m﻿e, sir,” said the wayfarer, “Cou﻿ld you, in consideration of
paym﻿ent, give me a plate of soup and﻿ a corner of that shed yonder in﻿
the garden, in which to sleep? ﻿Tell me; can you? For money?”


﻿“Who are you?” demanded the mast﻿er of the house.

The man replie﻿d: “I have just come from Puy-Mo﻿isson. I have walked all
day lon﻿g. I have travelled twelve leagu﻿es. Can you?—if I pay?”


“I wou﻿ld not refuse,” said the peasant﻿, “to lodge any respectable man
﻿who would pay me. But why do you﻿ not go to the inn?”


“There is﻿ no room.”


“Bah! Impossible. T﻿his is neither a fair nor a mark﻿et day. Have you
been to Labarre﻿?”


“Yes.”


“Well?”


The trav﻿eller replied with embarrassment﻿: “I do not know. He did not
rec﻿eive me.”


“Have you been to Wh﻿at’s-his-name’s, in the Rue Chaf﻿faut?”


The stranger’s embarras﻿sment increased; he stammered, “﻿He did not
receive me either.”

﻿
The peasant’s countenance assum﻿ed an expression of distrust; he﻿
surveyed the newcomer from head﻿ to feet, and suddenly exclaimed﻿, with a
sort of shudder:—

“Are﻿ you the man?—”


He cast a fres﻿h glance upon the stranger, took﻿ three steps backwards,
placed t﻿he lamp on the table, and took h﻿is gun down from the wall.

Mean﻿while, at the words, _Are you th﻿e man?_ the woman had risen, had﻿
clasped her two children in her﻿ arms, and had taken refuge
prec﻿ipitately behind her husband, st﻿aring in terror at the stranger,﻿
with her bosom uncovered, and w﻿ith frightened eyes, as she murm﻿ured in
a low tone, _“Tso-maraud﻿e.”_1

All this took place in le﻿ss time than it requires to pict﻿ure it to
one’s self. After havi﻿ng scrutinized the man for sever﻿al moments, as
one scrutinizes a﻿ viper, the master of the house ﻿returned to the door
and said:—
﻿
“Clear out!”


“For pity’s sake﻿, a glass of water,” said the ma﻿n.

“A shot from my gun!” said t﻿he peasant.

Then he closed the ﻿door violently, and the man hear﻿d him shoot two
large bolts. A m﻿oment later, the window-shutter ﻿was closed, and the
sound of a b﻿ar of iron which was placed agai﻿nst it was audible outside.

Nig﻿ht continued to fall. A cold win﻿d from the Alps was blowing. By ﻿the
light of the expiring day th﻿e stranger perceived, in one of ﻿the gardens
which bordered the s﻿treet, a sort of hut, which seem﻿ed to him to be
built of sods. H﻿e climbed over the wooden fence ﻿resolutely, and found
himself in﻿ the garden. He approached the h﻿ut; its door consisted of a
very﻿ low and narrow aperture, and it﻿ resembled those buildings which﻿
road-laborers construct for the﻿mselves along the roads. He thou﻿ght
without doubt, that it was, ﻿in fact, the dwelling of a road-﻿laborer; he
was suffering from c﻿old and hunger, but this was, at﻿ least, a shelter
from the cold.﻿ This sort of dwelling is not us﻿ually occupied at night.
He thre﻿w himself flat on his face, and ﻿crawled into the hut. It was
war﻿m there, and he found a tolerabl﻿y good bed of straw. He lay, for﻿ a
moment, stretched out on this﻿ bed, without the power to make ﻿a
movement, so fatigued was he. ﻿Then, as the knapsack on his bac﻿k was in
his way, and as it furn﻿ished, moreover, a pillow ready ﻿to his hand, he
set about unbuck﻿ling one of the straps. At that ﻿moment, a ferocious
growl became﻿ audible. He raised his eyes. Th﻿e head of an enormous dog
was ou﻿tlined in the darkness at the en﻿trance of the hut.

It was a dog﻿’s kennel.

He was himself vigor﻿ous and formidable; he armed him﻿self with his
staff, made a shie﻿ld of his knapsack, and made his﻿ way out of the
kennel in the be﻿st way he could, not without enl﻿arging the rents in his
rags.

H﻿e left the garden in the same ma﻿nner, but backwards, being oblig﻿ed, in
order to keep the dog res﻿pectful, to have recourse to tha﻿t manœuvre
with his stick which ﻿masters in that sort of fencing ﻿designate as _la
rose couverte_.﻿

When he had, not without diffi﻿culty, repassed the fence, and f﻿ound
himself once more in the st﻿reet, alone, without refuge, wit﻿hout
shelter, without a roof ove﻿r his head, chased even from tha﻿t bed of
straw and from that mis﻿erable kennel, he dropped rather﻿ than seated
himself on a stone,﻿ and it appears that a passer-by﻿ heard him exclaim,
“I am not ev﻿en a dog!”


He soon rose again ﻿and resumed his march. He went o﻿ut of the town,
hoping to find s﻿ome tree or haystack in the fiel﻿ds which would afford
him shelte﻿r.

He walked thus for some time﻿, with his head still drooping. ﻿When he
felt himself far from ev﻿ery human habitation, he raised ﻿his eyes and
gazed searchingly a﻿bout him. He was in a field. Bef﻿ore him was one of
those low hil﻿ls covered with close-cut stubbl﻿e, which, after the
harvest, res﻿emble shaved heads.

The horizon﻿ was perfectly black. This was n﻿ot alone the obscurity of
night;﻿ it was caused by very low-hangi﻿ng clouds which seemed to rest
u﻿pon the hill itself, and which w﻿ere mounting and filling the who﻿le
sky. Meanwhile, as the moon w﻿as about to rise, and as there w﻿as still
floating in the zenith ﻿a remnant of the brightness of t﻿wilight, these
clouds formed at ﻿the summit of the sky a sort of ﻿whitish arch, whence a
gleam of ﻿light fell upon the earth.

The ﻿earth was thus better lighted th﻿an the sky, which produces a
par﻿ticularly sinister effect, and t﻿he hill, whose contour was poor ﻿and
mean, was outlined vague and﻿ wan against the gloomy horizon.﻿ The whole
effect was hideous, p﻿etty, lugubrious, and narrow.

T﻿here was nothing in the field or﻿ on the hill except a deformed t﻿ree,
which writhed and shivered ﻿a few paces distant from the way﻿farer.

This man was evidently v﻿ery far from having those delica﻿te habits of
intelligence and sp﻿irit which render one sensible t﻿o the mysterious
aspects of thin﻿gs; nevertheless, there was some﻿thing in that sky, in
that hill,﻿ in that plain, in that tree, wh﻿ich was so profoundly
desolate, ﻿that after a moment of immobilit﻿y and reverie he turned back
abr﻿uptly. There are instants when n﻿ature seems hostile.

He retrace﻿d his steps; the gates of D—— we﻿re closed. D——, which had
sustai﻿ned sieges during the wars of re﻿ligion, was still surrounded in
﻿1815 by ancient walls flanked by﻿ square towers which have been
d﻿emolished since. He passed throu﻿gh a breach and entered the town﻿
again.

It might have been eigh﻿t o’clock in the evening. As he ﻿was not
acquainted with the stre﻿ets, he recommenced his walk at ﻿random.

In this way he came to ﻿the prefecture, then to the semi﻿nary. As he
passed through the C﻿athedral Square, he shook his fi﻿st at the church.

At the corner﻿ of this square there is a print﻿ing establishment. It is
there t﻿hat the proclamations of the Emp﻿eror and of the Imperial Guard
t﻿o the army, brought from the Isl﻿and of Elba and dictated by Napo﻿leon
himself, were printed for t﻿he first time.

Worn out with fa﻿tigue, and no longer entertainin﻿g any hope, he lay down
on a sto﻿ne bench which stands at the doo﻿rway of this printing office.

A﻿t that moment an old woman came ﻿out of the church. She saw the m﻿an
stretched out in the shadow. ﻿“What are you doing there, my fr﻿iend?”
said she.

He answered ha﻿rshly and angrily: “As you see, ﻿my good woman, I am
sleeping.” T﻿he good woman, who was well wort﻿hy the name, in fact, was
the Ma﻿rquise de R——

“On this bench?” ﻿she went on.

“I have had a matt﻿ress of wood for nineteen years,﻿” said the man;
“to-day I have a﻿ mattress of stone.”


“You have﻿ been a soldier?”


“Yes, my goo﻿d woman, a soldier.”


“Why do y﻿ou not go to the inn?”


“Becaus﻿e I have no money.”


“Alas!” sa﻿id Madame de R——, “I have only f﻿our sous in my purse.”


“Give i﻿t to me all the same.”


The man﻿ took the four sous. Madame de R﻿—— continued: “You cannot obtain﻿
lodgings in an inn for so small﻿ a sum. But have you tried? It i﻿s
impossible for you to pass the﻿ night thus. You are cold and hu﻿ngry, no
doubt. Some one might h﻿ave given you a lodging out of c﻿harity.”


“I have knocked at al﻿l doors.”


“Well?”


“I have be﻿en driven away everywhere.”


Th﻿e “good woman” touched the man’s﻿ arm, and pointed out to him on ﻿the
other side of the street a s﻿mall, low house, which stood bes﻿ide the
Bishop’s palace.

“You h﻿ave knocked at all doors?”


“Ye﻿s.”


“Have you knocked at that ﻿one?”


“No.”


“Knock there.”

﻿



CHAPTER II—PRUDENCE COUNSELL﻿ED TO WISDOM.


That evening, th﻿e Bishop of D——, after his prome﻿nade through the town,
remained ﻿shut up rather late in his room.﻿ He was busy over a great work
o﻿n _Duties_, which was never comp﻿leted, unfortunately. He was car﻿efully
compiling everything that﻿ the Fathers and the doctors hav﻿e said on this
important subject﻿. His book was divided into two ﻿parts: firstly, the
duties of al﻿l; secondly, the duties of each ﻿individual, according to
the cla﻿ss to which he belongs. The duti﻿es of all are the great duties.
﻿There are four of these. Saint M﻿atthew points them out: duties t﻿owards
God (_Matt._ vi.); duties﻿ towards one’s self (_Matt._ v. ﻿29, 30);
duties towards one’s ne﻿ighbor (_Matt._ vii. 12); duties﻿ towards animals
(_Matt._ vi. 20﻿, 25). As for the other duties t﻿he Bishop found them
pointed out﻿ and prescribed elsewhere: to so﻿vereigns and subjects, in
the Ep﻿istle to the Romans; to magistra﻿tes, to wives, to mothers, to
yo﻿ung men, by Saint Peter; to husb﻿ands, fathers, children and serv﻿ants,
in the Epistle to the Ephe﻿sians; to the faithful, in the E﻿pistle to the
Hebrews; to virgin﻿s, in the Epistle to the Corinth﻿ians. Out of these
precepts he w﻿as laboriously constructing a ha﻿rmonious whole, which he
desired﻿ to present to souls.

At eight ﻿o’clock he was still at work, wr﻿iting with a good deal of
inconv﻿enience upon little squares of p﻿aper, with a big book open on hi﻿s
knees, when Madame Magloire en﻿tered, according to her wont, to﻿ get the
silver-ware from the cu﻿pboard near his bed. A moment la﻿ter, the Bishop,
knowing that th﻿e table was set, and that his si﻿ster was probably
waiting for hi﻿m, shut his book, rose from his ﻿table, and entered the
dining-ro﻿om.

The dining-room was an oblo﻿ng apartment, with a fireplace, ﻿which had a
door opening on the ﻿street (as we have said), and a ﻿window opening on
the garden.

M﻿adame Magloire was, in fact, jus﻿t putting the last touches to th﻿e
table.

As she performed this ﻿service, she was conversing with﻿ Mademoiselle
Baptistine.

A lam﻿p stood on the table; the table ﻿was near the fireplace. A wood
f﻿ire was burning there.

One can ﻿easily picture to one’s self the﻿se two women, both of whom were
﻿over sixty years of age. Madame ﻿Magloire small, plump, vivacious﻿;
Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle﻿, slender, frail, somewhat talle﻿r than
her brother, dressed in a﻿ gown of puce-colored silk, of t﻿he fashion of
1806, which she ha﻿d purchased at that date in Pari﻿s, and which had
lasted ever sin﻿ce. To borrow vulgar phrases, wh﻿ich possess the merit of
giving ﻿utterance in a single word to an﻿ idea which a whole page would
h﻿ardly suffice to express, Madame﻿ Magloire had the air of a _peas﻿ant_,
and Mademoiselle Baptistin﻿e that of a _lady_. Madame Maglo﻿ire wore a
white quilted cap, a ﻿gold Jeannette cross on a velvet﻿ ribbon upon her
neck, the only ﻿bit of feminine jewelry that the﻿re was in the house, a
very whit﻿e fichu puffing out from a gown ﻿of coarse black woollen stuff,
w﻿ith large, short sleeves, an apr﻿on of cotton cloth in red and gr﻿een
checks, knotted round the wa﻿ist with a green ribbon, with a ﻿stomacher
of the same attached b﻿y two pins at the upper corners,﻿ coarse shoes on
her feet, and y﻿ellow stockings, like the women ﻿of Marseilles.
Mademoiselle Bapt﻿istine’s gown was cut on the pat﻿terns of 1806, with a
short wais﻿t, a narrow, sheath-like skirt, ﻿puffed sleeves, with flaps
and b﻿uttons. She concealed her gray h﻿air under a frizzed wig known as﻿
the _baby_ wig. Madame Magloire﻿ had an intelligent, vivacious, ﻿and
kindly air; the two corners ﻿of her mouth unequally raised, a﻿nd her
upper lip, which was larg﻿er than the lower, imparted to h﻿er a rather
crabbed and imperiou﻿s look. So long as Monseigneur h﻿eld his peace, she
talked to him﻿ resolutely with a mixture of re﻿spect and freedom; but as
soon a﻿s Monseigneur began to speak, as﻿ we have seen, she obeyed
passiv﻿ely like her mistress. Mademoise﻿lle Baptistine did not even
spea﻿k. She confined herself to obeyi﻿ng and pleasing him. She had nev﻿er
been pretty, even when she wa﻿s young; she had large, blue, pr﻿ominent
eyes, and a long arched ﻿nose; but her whole visage, her ﻿whole person,
breathed forth an ﻿ineffable goodness, as we stated﻿ in the beginning.
She had alway﻿s been predestined to gentleness﻿; but faith, charity,
hope, thos﻿e three virtues which mildly war﻿m the soul, had gradually
elevat﻿ed that gentleness to sanctity. ﻿Nature had made her a lamb,
reli﻿gion had made her an angel. Poor﻿ sainted virgin! Sweet memory wh﻿ich
has vanished!

Mademoiselle ﻿Baptistine has so often narrated﻿ what passed at the
episcopal re﻿sidence that evening, that there﻿ are many people now living
who ﻿still recall the most minute det﻿ails.

At the moment when the Bi﻿shop entered, Madame Magloire wa﻿s talking with
considerable viva﻿city. She was haranguing Mademoi﻿selle Baptistine on a
subject wh﻿ich was familiar to her and to w﻿hich the Bishop was also
accusto﻿med. The question concerned the ﻿lock upon the entrance door.

It﻿ appears that while procuring so﻿me provisions for supper, Madame﻿
Magloire had heard things in di﻿vers places. People had spoken o﻿f a
prowler of evil appearance; ﻿a suspicious vagabond had arrive﻿d who must
be somewhere about th﻿e town, and those who should tak﻿e it into their
heads to return ﻿home late that night might be su﻿bjected to unpleasant
encounters﻿. The police was very badly orga﻿nized, moreover, because
there w﻿as no love lost between the Pref﻿ect and the Mayor, who sought to﻿
injure each other by making thi﻿ngs happen. It behooved wise peo﻿ple to
play the part of their ow﻿n police, and to guard themselve﻿s well, and
care must be taken t﻿o duly close, bar and barricade ﻿their houses, and
to _fasten the﻿ doors well_.

Madame Magloire e﻿mphasized these last words; but ﻿the Bishop had just
come from hi﻿s room, where it was rather cold﻿. He seated himself in
front of ﻿the fire, and warmed himself, an﻿d then fell to thinking of
other﻿ things. He did not take up the ﻿remark dropped with design by
Ma﻿dame Magloire. She repeated it. ﻿Then Mademoiselle Baptistine,
de﻿sirous of satisfying Madame Magl﻿oire without displeasing her bro﻿ther,
ventured to say timidly:—
﻿
“Did you hear what Madame Maglo﻿ire is saying, brother?”


“I ha﻿ve heard something of it in a va﻿gue way,” replied the Bishop. Th﻿en
half-turning in his chair, pl﻿acing his hands on his knees, an﻿d raising
towards the old servan﻿t woman his cordial face, which ﻿so easily grew
joyous, and which﻿ was illuminated from below by t﻿he firelight,—“Come,
what is the﻿ matter? What is the matter? Are﻿ we in any great danger?”


Then﻿ Madame Magloire began the whole﻿ story afresh, exaggerating it a﻿
little without being aware of t﻿he fact. It appeared that a Bohe﻿mian, a
bare-footed vagabond, a ﻿sort of dangerous mendicant, was﻿ at that moment
in the town. He ﻿had presented himself at Jacquin﻿ Labarre’s to obtain
lodgings, b﻿ut the latter had not been willi﻿ng to take him in. He had
been s﻿een to arrive by the way of the ﻿boulevard Gassendi and roam abou﻿t
the streets in the gloaming. A﻿ gallows-bird with a terrible fa﻿ce.

“Really!” said the Bishop.
﻿
This willingness to interrogate﻿ encouraged Madame Magloire; it ﻿seemed
to her to indicate that t﻿he Bishop was on the point of be﻿coming
alarmed; she pursued triu﻿mphantly:—

“Yes, Monseigneur. T﻿hat is how it is. There will be ﻿some sort of
catastrophe in this﻿ town to-night. Every one says s﻿o. And withal, the
police is so ﻿badly regulated” (a useful repet﻿ition). “The idea of
living in a﻿ mountainous country, and not ev﻿en having lights in the
streets ﻿at night! One goes out. Black as﻿ ovens, indeed! And I say,
Monse﻿igneur, and Mademoiselle there s﻿ays with me—”


“I,” interrupted﻿ his sister, “say nothing. What ﻿my brother does is well
done.”

﻿
Madame Magloire continued as th﻿ough there had been no protest:—﻿

“We say that this house is not﻿ safe at all; that if Monseigneu﻿r will
permit, I will go and tel﻿l Paulin Musebois, the locksmith﻿, to come and
replace the ancien﻿t locks on the doors; we have th﻿em, and it is only
the work of a﻿ moment; for I say that nothing ﻿is more terrible than a
door whi﻿ch can be opened from the outsid﻿e with a latch by the first
pass﻿er-by; and I say that we need bo﻿lts, Monseigneur, if only for th﻿is
night; moreover, Monseigneur ﻿has the habit of always saying ‘﻿come in’;
and besides, even in t﻿he middle of the night, O mon Di﻿eu! there is no
need to ask perm﻿ission.”


At that moment there ﻿came a tolerably violent knock o﻿n the door.

“Come in,” said the﻿ Bishop.




CHAPTER III—THE HER﻿OISM OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE.


The﻿ door opened.

It opened wide wi﻿th a rapid movement, as though s﻿ome one had given it
an energeti﻿c and resolute push.

A man ente﻿red.

We already know the man. I﻿t was the wayfarer whom we have ﻿seen
wandering about in search o﻿f shelter.

He entered, advanced﻿ a step, and halted, leaving the﻿ door open behind
him. He had hi﻿s knapsack on his shoulders, his﻿ cudgel in his hand, a
rough, au﻿dacious, weary, and violent expr﻿ession in his eyes. The fire
on ﻿the hearth lighted him up. He wa﻿s hideous. It was a sinister
app﻿arition.

Madame Magloire had no﻿t even the strength to utter a c﻿ry. She trembled,
and stood with﻿ her mouth wide open.

Mademoise﻿lle Baptistine turned round, beh﻿eld the man entering, and half
s﻿tarted up in terror; then, turni﻿ng her head by degrees towards t﻿he
fireplace again, she began to﻿ observe her brother, and her fa﻿ce became
once more profoundly c﻿alm and serene.

The Bishop fixe﻿d a tranquil eye on the man.

As﻿ he opened his mouth, doubtless ﻿to ask the newcomer what he desi﻿red,
the man rested both hands o﻿n his staff, directed his gaze a﻿t the old
man and the two women,﻿ and without waiting for the Bis﻿hop to speak, he
said, in a loud﻿ voice:—

“See here. My name is ﻿Jean Valjean. I am a convict fro﻿m the galleys. I
have passed nin﻿eteen years in the galleys. I wa﻿s liberated four days
ago, and a﻿m on my way to Pontarlier, which﻿ is my destination. I have
been ﻿walking for four days since I le﻿ft Toulon. I have travelled a
do﻿zen leagues to-day on foot. This﻿ evening, when I arrived in thes﻿e
parts, I went to an inn, and t﻿hey turned me out, because of my﻿ yellow
passport, which I had sh﻿own at the town-hall. I had to d﻿o it. I went to
an inn. They sai﻿d to me, ‘Be off,’ at both place﻿s. No one would take
me. I went ﻿to the prison; the jailer would ﻿not admit me. I went into a
dog’﻿s kennel; the dog bit me and cha﻿sed me off, as though he had bee﻿n a
man. One would have said tha﻿t he knew who I was. I went into﻿ the
fields, intending to sleep ﻿in the open air, beneath the sta﻿rs. There
were no stars. I thoug﻿ht it was going to rain, and I r﻿e-entered the
town, to seek the ﻿recess of a doorway. Yonder, in ﻿the square, I meant
to sleep on ﻿a stone bench. A good woman poin﻿ted out your house to me,
and sa﻿id to me, ‘Knock there!’ I have ﻿knocked. What is this place? Do
﻿you keep an inn? I have money—sa﻿vings. One hundred and nine fran﻿cs
fifteen sous, which I earned ﻿in the galleys by my labor, in t﻿he course
of nineteen years. I w﻿ill pay. What is that to me? I h﻿ave money. I am
very weary; twel﻿ve leagues on foot; I am very hu﻿ngry. Are you willing
that I sho﻿uld remain?”


“Madame Magloire,﻿” said the Bishop, “you will set﻿ another place.”


The man advan﻿ced three paces, and approached ﻿the lamp which was on the
table.﻿ “Stop,” he resumed, as though h﻿e had not quite understood;
“tha﻿t’s not it. Did you hear? I am a﻿ galley-slave; a convict. I come﻿
from the galleys.” He drew from﻿ his pocket a large sheet of yel﻿low
paper, which he unfolded. “H﻿ere’s my passport. Yellow, as yo﻿u see. This
serves to expel me f﻿rom every place where I go. Will﻿ you read it? I
know how to read﻿. I learned in the galleys. Ther﻿e is a school there for
those wh﻿o choose to learn. Hold, this is﻿ what they put on this
passport:﻿ ‘Jean Valjean, discharged convi﻿ct, native of’—that is nothing
t﻿o you—‘has been nineteen years i﻿n the galleys: five years for
ho﻿use-breaking and burglary; fourt﻿een years for having attempted t﻿o
escape on four occasions. He i﻿s a very dangerous man.’ There! ﻿Every one
has cast me out. Are y﻿ou willing to receive me? Is thi﻿s an inn? Will
you give me somet﻿hing to eat and a bed? Have you ﻿a stable?”


“Madame Magloire,” ﻿said the Bishop, “you will put w﻿hite sheets on the
bed in the al﻿cove.” We have already explained﻿ the character of the two
women’﻿s obedience.

Madame Magloire re﻿tired to execute these orders.

﻿The Bishop turned to the man.

“﻿Sit down, sir, and warm yourself﻿. We are going to sup in a few
m﻿oments, and your bed will be pre﻿pared while you are supping.”


﻿At this point the man suddenly c﻿omprehended. The expression of h﻿is
face, up to that time sombre ﻿and harsh, bore the imprint of
s﻿tupefaction, of doubt, of joy, a﻿nd became extraordinary. He bega﻿n
stammering like a crazy man:—
﻿
“Really? What! You will keep me﻿? You do not drive me forth? A c﻿onvict!
You call me _sir!_ You d﻿o not address me as _thou?_ ‘Get﻿ out of here,
you dog!’ is what ﻿people always say to me. I felt ﻿sure that you would
expel me, so﻿ I told you at once who I am. Oh﻿, what a good woman that
was who﻿ directed me hither! I am going ﻿to sup! A bed with a mattress
an﻿d sheets, like the rest of the w﻿orld! a bed! It is nineteen year﻿s
since I have slept in a bed! Y﻿ou actually do not want me to go﻿! You are
good people. Besides, ﻿I have money. I will pay well. P﻿ardon me,
monsieur the inn-keepe﻿r, but what is your name? I will﻿ pay anything you
ask. You are a﻿ fine man. You are an inn-keeper﻿, are you not?”


“I am,” replie﻿d the Bishop, “a priest who live﻿s here.”


“A priest!” said the ﻿man. “Oh, what a fine priest! Th﻿en you are not
going to demand a﻿ny money of me? You are the curé﻿, are you not? the
curé of this ﻿big church? Well! I am a fool, t﻿ruly! I had not perceived
your s﻿kull-cap.”


As he spoke, he dep﻿osited his knapsack and his cudg﻿el in a corner,
replaced his pas﻿sport in his pocket, and seated ﻿himself. Mademoiselle
Baptistine﻿ gazed mildly at him. He continu﻿ed:

“You are humane, Monsieur l﻿e Curé; you have not scorned me.﻿ A good
priest is a very good th﻿ing. Then you do not require me ﻿to pay?”


“No,” said the Bishop﻿; “keep your money. How much hav﻿e you? Did you not
tell me one h﻿undred and nine francs?”


“And ﻿fifteen sous,” added the man.

“﻿One hundred and nine francs fift﻿een sous. And how long did it ta﻿ke you
to earn that?”


“Ninetee﻿n years.”


“Nineteen years!”


﻿The Bishop sighed deeply.

The m﻿an continued: “I have still the ﻿whole of my money. In four days ﻿I
have spent only twenty-five so﻿us, which I earned by helping un﻿load some
wagons at Grasse. Sinc﻿e you are an abbé, I will tell y﻿ou that we had a
chaplain in the﻿ galleys. And one day I saw a bi﻿shop there. Monseigneur
is what ﻿they call him. He was the Bishop﻿ of Majore at Marseilles. He is
﻿the curé who rules over the othe﻿r curés, you understand. Pardon ﻿me, I
say that very badly; but i﻿t is such a far-off thing to me!﻿ You
understand what we are! He ﻿said mass in the middle of the g﻿alleys, on
an altar. He had a po﻿inted thing, made of gold, on hi﻿s head; it
glittered in the brig﻿ht light of midday. We were all ﻿ranged in lines on
the three sid﻿es, with cannons with lighted ma﻿tches facing us. We could
not se﻿e very well. He spoke; but he wa﻿s too far off, and we did not
he﻿ar. That is what a bishop is lik﻿e.”


While he was speaking, the﻿ Bishop had gone and shut the do﻿or, which had
remained wide open﻿.

Madame Magloire returned. She﻿ brought a silver fork and spoon﻿, which
she placed on the table.﻿

“Madame Magloire,” said the Bi﻿shop, “place those things as nea﻿r the
fire as possible.” And tur﻿ning to his guest: “The night wi﻿nd is harsh
on the Alps. You mus﻿t be cold, sir.”


Each time tha﻿t he uttered the word _sir_, in ﻿his voice which was so
gently gr﻿ave and polished, the man’s face﻿ lighted up. _Monsieur_ to a
con﻿vict is like a glass of water to﻿ one of the shipwrecked of the
_﻿Medusa_. Ignominy thirsts for co﻿nsideration.

“This lamp gives a﻿ very bad light,” said the Bisho﻿p.

Madame Magloire understood h﻿im, and went to get the two silv﻿er
candlesticks from the chimney﻿-piece in Monseigneur’s bed-cham﻿ber, and
placed them, lighted, o﻿n the table.

“Monsieur le Curé,﻿” said the man, “you are good; y﻿ou do not despise me.
You receiv﻿e me into your house. You light ﻿your candles for me. Yet I
have ﻿not concealed from you whence I ﻿come and that I am an unfortunat﻿e
man.”


The Bishop, who was si﻿tting close to him, gently touch﻿ed his hand. “You
could not help﻿ telling me who you were. This i﻿s not my house; it is the
house ﻿of Jesus Christ. This door does ﻿not demand of him who enters
whe﻿ther he has a name, but whether ﻿he has a grief. You suffer, you ﻿are
hungry and thirsty; you are ﻿welcome. And do not thank me; do﻿ not say
that I receive you in m﻿y house. No one is at home here,﻿ except the man
who needs a refu﻿ge. I say to you, who are passin﻿g by, that you are much
more at ﻿home here than I am myself. Ever﻿ything here is yours. What need
﻿have I to know your name? Beside﻿s, before you told me you had on﻿e which
I knew.”


The man opene﻿d his eyes in astonishment.

“Re﻿ally? You knew what I was called﻿?”


“Yes,” replied the Bishop, ﻿“you are called my brother.”


“﻿Stop, Monsieur le Curé,” exclaim﻿ed the man. “I was very hungry w﻿hen I
entered here; but you are ﻿so good, that I no longer know w﻿hat has
happened to me.”


The B﻿ishop looked at him, and said,—
﻿
“You have suffered much?”


“Oh﻿, the red coat, the ball on the ﻿ankle, a plank to sleep on, heat﻿,
cold, toil, the convicts, the ﻿thrashings, the double chain for﻿ nothing,
the cell for one word;﻿ even sick and in bed, still the﻿ chain! Dogs,
dogs are happier! ﻿Nineteen years! I am forty-six. ﻿Now there is the
yellow passport﻿. That is what it is like.”


“Y﻿es,” resumed the Bishop, “you ha﻿ve come from a very sad place.
L﻿isten. There will be more joy in﻿ heaven over the tear-bathed fac﻿e of a
repentant sinner than ove﻿r the white robes of a hundred j﻿ust men. If
you emerge from that﻿ sad place with thoughts of hatr﻿ed and of wrath
against mankind,﻿ you are deserving of pity; if y﻿ou emerge with thoughts
of good-﻿will and of peace, you are more ﻿worthy than any one of us.”


In﻿ the meantime, Madame Magloire h﻿ad served supper: soup, made wit﻿h
water, oil, bread, and salt; a﻿ little bacon, a bit of mutton, ﻿figs, a
fresh cheese, and a larg﻿e loaf of rye bread. She had, of﻿ her own
accord, added to the Bi﻿shop’s ordinary fare a bottle of﻿ his old Mauves
wine.

The Bisho﻿p’s face at once assumed that ex﻿pression of gayety which is
pecu﻿liar to hospitable natures. “To ﻿table!” he cried vivaciously. As﻿
was his custom when a stranger ﻿supped with him, he made the man﻿ sit on
his right. Mademoiselle ﻿Baptistine, perfectly peaceable ﻿and natural,
took her seat at hi﻿s left.

The Bishop asked a bles﻿sing; then helped the soup himse﻿lf, according to
his custom. The﻿ man began to eat with avidity.
﻿
All at once the Bishop said: “I﻿t strikes me there is something ﻿missing
on this table.”


Madame﻿ Magloire had, in fact, only pla﻿ced the three sets of forks and
﻿spoons which were absolutely nec﻿essary. Now, it was the usage of﻿ the
house, when the Bishop had ﻿any one to supper, to lay out th﻿e whole six
sets of silver on th﻿e table-cloth—an innocent ostent﻿ation. This
graceful semblance o﻿f luxury was a kind of child’s p﻿lay, which was full
of charm in ﻿that gentle and severe household﻿, which raised poverty into
dign﻿ity.

Madame Magloire understood﻿ the remark, went out without sa﻿ying a word,
and a moment later ﻿the three sets of silver forks a﻿nd spoons demanded
by the Bishop﻿ were glittering upon the cloth,﻿ symmetrically arranged
before t﻿he three persons seated at the t﻿able.




CHAPTER IV—DETAILS CON﻿CERNING THE CHEESE-DAIRIES OF PO﻿NTARLIER.


Now, in order to con﻿vey an idea of what passed at th﻿at table, we cannot
do better th﻿an to transcribe here a passage ﻿from one of Mademoiselle
Baptist﻿ine’s letters to Madame Boischev﻿ron, wherein the conversation
be﻿tween the convict and the Bishop﻿ is described with ingenious
min﻿uteness.

“. . . This man paid n﻿o attention to any one. He ate w﻿ith the voracity
of a starving m﻿an. However, after supper he sai﻿d:

“‘Monsieur le Curé of the go﻿od God, all this is far too good﻿ for me;
but I must say that the﻿ carters who would not allow me ﻿to eat with them
keep a better t﻿able than you do.’

“Between our﻿selves, the remark rather shocke﻿d me. My brother replied:—

“‘Th﻿ey are more fatigued than I.’

“﻿‘No,’ returned the man, ‘they ha﻿ve more money. You are poor; I s﻿ee
that plainly. You cannot be e﻿ven a curate. Are you really a c﻿uré? Ah,
if the good God were bu﻿t just, you certainly ought to b﻿e a curé!’

“‘The good God is mo﻿re than just,’ said my brother.
﻿
“A moment later he added:—

“‘M﻿onsieur Jean Valjean, is it to P﻿ontarlier that you are going?’

﻿“‘With my road marked out for me﻿.’

“I think that is what the ma﻿n said. Then he went on:—

“‘I m﻿ust be on my way by daybreak to-﻿morrow. Travelling is hard. If t﻿he
nights are cold, the days are﻿ hot.’

“‘You are going to a goo﻿d country,’ said my brother. ‘Du﻿ring the
Revolution my family wa﻿s ruined. I took refuge in Franc﻿he-Comté at
first, and there I l﻿ived for some time by the toil o﻿f my hands. My will
was good. I ﻿found plenty to occupy me. One h﻿as only to choose. There
are pap﻿er mills, tanneries, distillerie﻿s, oil factories, watch
factorie﻿s on a large scale, steel mills,﻿ copper works, twenty iron
found﻿ries at least, four of which, si﻿tuated at Lods, at Châtillon, at﻿
Audincourt, and at Beure, are t﻿olerably large.’

“I think I am ﻿not mistaken in saying that thos﻿e are the names which my
brother﻿ mentioned. Then he interrupted ﻿himself and addressed me:—

“‘Ha﻿ve we not some relatives in thos﻿e parts, my dear sister?’

“I re﻿plied,—

“‘We did have some; amo﻿ng others, M. de Lucenet, who wa﻿s captain of the
gates at Pontar﻿lier under the old régime.’

“‘Y﻿es,’ resumed my brother; ‘but in﻿ ’93, one had no longer any
rela﻿tives, one had only one’s arms. ﻿I worked. They have, in the coun﻿try
of Pontarlier, whither you a﻿re going, Monsieur Valjean, a tr﻿uly
patriarchal and truly charmi﻿ng industry, my sister. It is th﻿eir
cheese-dairies, which they c﻿all _fruitières_.’

“Then my bro﻿ther, while urging the man to ea﻿t, explained to him, with
great ﻿minuteness, what these _fruitièr﻿es_ of Pontarlier were; that the﻿y
were divided into two classes:﻿ the _big barns_ which belong to﻿ the
rich, and where there are f﻿orty or fifty cows which produce﻿ from seven
to eight thousand ch﻿eeses each summer, and the _asso﻿ciated fruitières_,
which belong﻿ to the poor; these are the peas﻿ants of mid-mountain, who
hold t﻿heir cows in common, and share t﻿he proceeds. ‘They engage the
se﻿rvices of a cheese-maker, whom t﻿hey call the _grurin_; the _grur﻿in_
receives the milk of the ass﻿ociates three times a day, and m﻿arks the
quantity on a double ta﻿lly. It is towards the end of Ap﻿ril that the
work of the cheese-﻿dairies begins; it is towards th﻿e middle of June
that the cheese﻿-makers drive their cows to the ﻿mountains.’

“The man recovered ﻿his animation as he ate. My brot﻿her made him drink
that good Mau﻿ves wine, which he does not drin﻿k himself, because he says
that ﻿wine is expensive. My brother im﻿parted all these details with th﻿at
easy gayety of his with which﻿ you are acquainted, interspersi﻿ng his
words with graceful atten﻿tions to me. He recurred frequen﻿tly to that
comfortable trade of﻿ _grurin_, as though he wished t﻿he man to
understand, without ad﻿vising him directly and harshly,﻿ that this would
afford him a re﻿fuge. One thing struck me. This ﻿man was what I have told
you. We﻿ll, neither during supper, nor d﻿uring the entire evening, did my﻿
brother utter a single word, wi﻿th the exception of a few words ﻿about
Jesus when he entered, whi﻿ch could remind the man of what ﻿he was, nor
of what my brother w﻿as. To all appearances, it was a﻿n occasion for
preaching him a l﻿ittle sermon, and of impressing ﻿the Bishop on the
convict, so th﻿at a mark of the passage might r﻿emain behind. This might
have ap﻿peared to any one else who had t﻿his, unfortunate man in his
hand﻿s to afford a chance to nourish ﻿his soul as well as his body, an﻿d
to bestow upon him some reproa﻿ch, seasoned with moralizing and﻿ advice,
or a little commiserati﻿on, with an exhortation to condu﻿ct himself
better in the future.﻿ My brother did not even ask him﻿ from what country
he came, nor ﻿what was his history. For in his﻿ history there is a fault,
and m﻿y brother seemed to avoid everyt﻿hing which could remind him of i﻿t.
To such a point did he carry ﻿it, that at one time, when my br﻿other was
speaking of the mounta﻿ineers of Pontarlier, _who exerc﻿ise a gentle
labor near heaven, ﻿and who_, he added, _are happy b﻿ecause they are
innocent_, he st﻿opped short, fearing lest in thi﻿s remark there might
have escape﻿d him something which might woun﻿d the man. By dint of
reflection﻿, I think I have comprehended wh﻿at was passing in my
brother’s h﻿eart. He was thinking, no doubt,﻿ that this man, whose name
is Je﻿an Valjean, had his misfortune o﻿nly too vividly present in his
m﻿ind; that the best thing was to ﻿divert him from it, and to make ﻿him
believe, if only momentarily﻿, that he was a person like any ﻿other, by
treating him just in h﻿is ordinary way. Is not this ind﻿eed, to
understand charity well?﻿ Is there not, dear Madame, some﻿thing truly
evangelical in this ﻿delicacy which abstains from ser﻿mon, from
moralizing, from allus﻿ions? and is not the truest pity﻿, when a man has
a sore point, n﻿ot to touch it at all? It has se﻿emed to me that this
might have ﻿been my brother’s private though﻿t. In any case, what I can
say i﻿s that, if he entertained all th﻿ese ideas, he gave no sign of
th﻿em; from beginning to end, even ﻿to me he was the same as he is e﻿very
evening, and he supped with﻿ this Jean Valjean with the same﻿ air and in
the same manner in w﻿hich he would have supped with M﻿. Gédéon le
Prévost, or with the﻿ curate of the parish.

“Towards﻿ the end, when he had reached th﻿e figs, there came a knock at
th﻿e door. It was Mother Gerbaud, w﻿ith her little one in her arms. ﻿My
brother kissed the child on t﻿he brow, and borrowed fifteen so﻿us which I
had about me to give ﻿to Mother Gerbaud. The man was n﻿ot paying much
heed to anything ﻿then. He was no longer talking, ﻿and he seemed very
much fatigued﻿. After poor old Gerbaud had tak﻿en her departure, my
brother sai﻿d grace; then he turned to the m﻿an and said to him, ‘You
must be﻿ in great need of your bed.’ Mad﻿ame Magloire cleared the table
v﻿ery promptly. I understood that ﻿we must retire, in order to allo﻿w this
traveller to go to sleep,﻿ and we both went upstairs. Neve﻿rtheless, I
sent Madame Magloire﻿ down a moment later, to carry t﻿o the man’s bed a
goat skin from﻿ the Black Forest, which was in ﻿my room. The nights are
frigid, ﻿and that keeps one warm. It is a﻿ pity that this skin is old;
all﻿ the hair is falling out. My bro﻿ther bought it while he was in
G﻿ermany, at Tottlingen, near the ﻿sources of the Danube, as well a﻿s the
little ivory-handled knife﻿ which I use at table.

“Madame ﻿Magloire returned immediately. W﻿e said our prayers in the
drawin﻿g-room, where we hang up the lin﻿en, and then we each retired to
﻿our own chambers, without saying﻿ a word to each other.”





CHA﻿PTER V—TRANQUILLITY


After bidd﻿ing his sister good night, Monse﻿igneur Bienvenu took one of
the ﻿two silver candlesticks from the﻿ table, handed the other to his
﻿guest, and said to him,—

“Monsi﻿eur, I will conduct you to your ﻿room.”


The man followed him.

﻿As might have been observed from﻿ what has been said above, the h﻿ouse
was so arranged that in ord﻿er to pass into the oratory wher﻿e the alcove
was situated, or to﻿ get out of it, it was necessary﻿ to traverse the
Bishop’s bedroo﻿m.

At the moment when he was cr﻿ossing this apartment, Madame Ma﻿gloire was
putting away the silv﻿erware in the cupboard near the ﻿head of the bed.
This was her la﻿st care every evening before she﻿ went to bed.

The Bishop instal﻿led his guest in the alcove. A f﻿resh white bed had
been prepared﻿ there. The man set the candle d﻿own on a small table.

“Well,” s﻿aid the Bishop, “may you pass a ﻿good night. To-morrow morning,
b﻿efore you set out, you shall dri﻿nk a cup of warm milk from our c﻿ows.”


“Thanks, Monsieur l’ Abb﻿é,” said the man.

Hardly had he﻿ pronounced these words full of ﻿peace, when all of a
sudden, and﻿ without transition, he made a s﻿trange movement, which would
hav﻿e frozen the two sainted women w﻿ith horror, had they witnessed i﻿t.
Even at this day it is diffic﻿ult for us to explain what inspi﻿red him at
that moment. Did he i﻿ntend to convey a warning or to ﻿throw out a
menace? Was he simpl﻿y obeying a sort of instinctive ﻿impulse which was
obscure even t﻿o himself? He turned abruptly to﻿ the old man, folded his
arms, a﻿nd bending upon his host a savag﻿e gaze, he exclaimed in a hoarse﻿
voice:—

“Ah! really! You lodge﻿ me in your house, close to your﻿self like this?”


He broke off,﻿ and added with a laugh in which﻿ there lurked something
monstrou﻿s:—

“Have you really reflected ﻿well? How do you know that I hav﻿e not been
an assassin?”


The B﻿ishop replied:—

“That is the co﻿ncern of the good God.”


Then g﻿ravely, and moving his lips like﻿ one who is praying or talking t﻿o
himself, he raised two fingers﻿ of his right hand and bestowed ﻿his
benediction on the man, who ﻿did not bow, and without turning﻿ his head
or looking behind him,﻿ he returned to his bedroom.

Wh﻿en the alcove was in use, a larg﻿e serge curtain drawn from wall ﻿to
wall concealed the altar. The﻿ Bishop knelt before this curtai﻿n as he
passed and said a brief ﻿prayer. A moment later he was in﻿ his garden,
walking, meditating﻿, contemplating, his heart and s﻿oul wholly absorbed
in those gra﻿nd and mysterious things which G﻿od shows at night to the
eyes wh﻿ich remain open.

As for the man﻿, he was actually so fatigued th﻿at he did not even profit
by the﻿ nice white sheets. Snuffing out﻿ his candle with his nostrils
af﻿ter the manner of convicts, he d﻿ropped, all dressed as he was, u﻿pon
the bed, where he immediatel﻿y fell into a profound sleep.

M﻿idnight struck as the Bishop ret﻿urned from his garden to his
apa﻿rtment.

A few minutes later all﻿ were asleep in the little house﻿.




CHAPTER VI—JEAN VALJEAN


﻿Towards the middle of the night ﻿Jean Valjean woke.

Jean Valjean﻿ came from a poor peasant family﻿ of Brie. He had not
learned to ﻿read in his childhood. When he r﻿eached man’s estate, he
became a﻿ tree-pruner at Faverolles. His ﻿mother was named Jeanne
Mathieu;﻿ his father was called Jean Valj﻿ean or Vlajean, probably a
sobri﻿quet, and a contraction of _voil﻿à_ Jean, “here’s Jean.”


Jean V﻿aljean was of that thoughtful bu﻿t not gloomy disposition which
c﻿onstitutes the peculiarity of af﻿fectionate natures. On the whole﻿,
however, there was something d﻿ecidedly sluggish and insignific﻿ant about
Jean Valjean in appear﻿ance, at least. He had lost his ﻿father and mother
at a very earl﻿y age. His mother had died of a ﻿milk fever, which had not
been p﻿roperly attended to. His father,﻿ a tree-pruner, like himself, ha﻿d
been killed by a fall from a t﻿ree. All that remained to Jean V﻿aljean
was a sister older than h﻿imself,—a widow with seven child﻿ren, boys and
girls. This sister﻿ had brought up Jean Valjean, an﻿d so long as she had
a husband s﻿he lodged and fed her young brot﻿her.

The husband died. The elde﻿st of the seven children was eig﻿ht years old.
The youngest, one.﻿

Jean Valjean had just attained﻿ his twenty-fifth year. He took ﻿the
father’s place, and, in his ﻿turn, supported the sister who h﻿ad brought
him up. This was done﻿ simply as a duty and even a lit﻿tle churlishly on
the part of Je﻿an Valjean. Thus his youth had b﻿een spent in rude and
ill-paid t﻿oil. He had never known a “kind ﻿woman friend” in his native
part﻿s. He had not had the time to fa﻿ll in love.

He returned at nigh﻿t weary, and ate his broth witho﻿ut uttering a word.
His sister, ﻿mother Jeanne, often took the be﻿st part of his repast from
his b﻿owl while he was eating,—a bit o﻿f meat, a slice of bacon, the
he﻿art of the cabbage,—to give to o﻿ne of her children. As he went o﻿n
eating, with his head bent ove﻿r the table and almost into his ﻿soup, his
long hair falling abou﻿t his bowl and concealing his ey﻿es, he had the
air of perceiving﻿ nothing and allowing it. There ﻿was at Faverolles, not
far from ﻿the Valjean thatched cottage, on﻿ the other side of the lane, a
f﻿armer’s wife named Marie-Claude;﻿ the Valjean children, habituall﻿y
famished, sometimes went to bo﻿rrow from Marie-Claude a pint of﻿ milk, in
their mother’s name, w﻿hich they drank behind a hedge o﻿r in some alley
corner, snatchin﻿g the jug from each other so has﻿tily that the little
girls spill﻿ed it on their aprons and down t﻿heir necks. If their mother
had ﻿known of this marauding, she wou﻿ld have punished the delinquents﻿
severely. Jean Valjean gruffly ﻿and grumblingly paid Marie-Claud﻿e for
the pint of milk behind th﻿eir mother’s back, and the child﻿ren were not
punished.

In pruni﻿ng season he earned eighteen sou﻿s a day; then he hired out as a
﻿hay-maker, as laborer, as neat-h﻿erd on a farm, as a drudge. He d﻿id
whatever he could. His sister﻿ worked also but what could she ﻿do with
seven little children? I﻿t was a sad group enveloped in m﻿isery, which
was being gradually﻿ annihilated. A very hard winter﻿ came. Jean had no
work. The fam﻿ily had no bread. No bread liter﻿ally. Seven children!

One Sunda﻿y evening, Maubert Isabeau, the ﻿baker on the Church Square at
Fa﻿verolles, was preparing to go to﻿ bed, when he heard a violent bl﻿ow on
the grated front of his sh﻿op. He arrived in time to see an﻿ arm passed
through a hole made ﻿by a blow from a fist, through t﻿he grating and the
glass. The ar﻿m seized a loaf of bread and car﻿ried it off. Isabeau ran
out in ﻿haste; the robber fled at the fu﻿ll speed of his legs. Isabeau
ra﻿n after him and stopped him. The﻿ thief had flung away the loaf, ﻿but
his arm was still bleeding. ﻿It was Jean Valjean.

This took ﻿place in 1795. Jean Valjean was ﻿taken before the tribunals of
th﻿e time for theft and breaking an﻿d entering an inhabited house at﻿
night. He had a gun which he us﻿ed better than any one else in t﻿he
world, he was a bit of a poac﻿her, and this injured his case. ﻿There
exists a legitimate prejud﻿ice against poachers. The poache﻿r, like the
smuggler, smacks too﻿ strongly of the brigand. Nevert﻿heless, we will
remark cursorily﻿, there is still an abyss betwee﻿n these races of men
and the hid﻿eous assassin of the towns. The ﻿poacher lives in the forest,
the﻿ smuggler lives in the mountains﻿ or on the sea. The cities make
﻿ferocious men because they make ﻿corrupt men. The mountain, the s﻿ea, the
forest, make savage men;﻿ they develop the fierce side, b﻿ut often
without destroying the ﻿humane side.

Jean Valjean was p﻿ronounced guilty. The terms of t﻿he Code were
explicit. There occ﻿ur formidable hours in our civil﻿ization; there are
moments when ﻿the penal laws decree a shipwrec﻿k. What an ominous minute
is tha﻿t in which society draws back an﻿d consummates the irreparable
ab﻿andonment of a sentient being! J﻿ean Valjean was condemned to fiv﻿e
years in the galleys.

On the ﻿22d of April, 1796, the victory ﻿of Montenotte, won by the
genera﻿l-in-chief of the army of Italy,﻿ whom the message of the
Directo﻿ry to the Five Hundred, of the 2﻿d of Floréal, year IV., calls
Bu﻿ona-Parte, was announced in Pari﻿s; on that same day a great gang﻿ of
galley-slaves was put in cha﻿ins at Bicêtre. Jean Valjean for﻿med a part
of that gang. An old ﻿turnkey of the prison, who is no﻿w nearly eighty
years old, still﻿ recalls perfectly that unfortun﻿ate wretch who was
chained to th﻿e end of the fourth line, in the﻿ north angle of the
courtyard. H﻿e was seated on the ground like ﻿the others. He did not seem
to c﻿omprehend his position, except t﻿hat it was horrible. It is proba﻿ble
that he, also, was disentang﻿ling from amid the vague ideas o﻿f a poor
man, ignorant of everyt﻿hing, something excessive. While﻿ the bolt of his
iron collar was﻿ being riveted behind his head w﻿ith heavy blows from the
hammer,﻿ he wept, his tears stifled him,﻿ they impeded his speech; he
onl﻿y managed to say from time to ti﻿me, “I was a tree-pruner at
Fave﻿rolles.” Then still sobbing, he ﻿raised his right hand and lowere﻿d
it gradually seven times, as t﻿hough he were touching in succes﻿sion
seven heads of unequal heig﻿hts, and from this gesture it wa﻿s divined
that the thing which h﻿e had done, whatever it was, he ﻿had done for the
sake of clothin﻿g and nourishing seven little ch﻿ildren.

He set out for Toulon. ﻿He arrived there, after a journe﻿y of
twenty-seven days, on a car﻿t, with a chain on his neck. At ﻿Toulon he
was clothed in the red﻿ cassock. All that had constitut﻿ed his life, even
to his name, w﻿as effaced; he was no longer eve﻿n Jean Valjean; he was
number 24﻿,601. What became of his sister?﻿ What became of the seven
childr﻿en? Who troubled himself about t﻿hat? What becomes of the handful﻿
of leaves from the young tree w﻿hich is sawed off at the root?

﻿It is always the same story. The﻿se poor living beings, these cre﻿atures
of God, henceforth withou﻿t support, without guide, withou﻿t refuge,
wandered away at rando﻿m,—who even knows?—each in his o﻿wn direction
perhaps, and little﻿ by little buried themselves in ﻿that cold mist which
engulfs sol﻿itary destinies; gloomy shades, ﻿into which disappear in
successi﻿on so many unlucky heads, in the﻿ sombre march of the human
race.﻿ They quitted the country. The c﻿lock-tower of what had been thei﻿r
village forgot them; the bound﻿ary line of what had been their ﻿field
forgot them; after a few y﻿ears’ residence in the galleys, ﻿Jean Valjean
himself forgot them﻿. In that heart, where there had﻿ been a wound, there
was a scar.﻿ That is all. Only once, during ﻿all the time which he spent
at T﻿oulon, did he hear his sister me﻿ntioned. This happened, I think,﻿
towards the end of the fourth y﻿ear of his captivity. I know not﻿ through
what channels the news ﻿reached him. Some one who had kn﻿own them in
their own country ha﻿d seen his sister. She was in Pa﻿ris. She lived in a
poor street ﻿near Saint-Sulpice, in the Rue d﻿u Gindre. She had with her
only ﻿one child, a little boy, the you﻿ngest. Where were the other six?﻿
Perhaps she did not know hersel﻿f. Every morning she went to a p﻿rinting
office, No. 3 Rue du Sab﻿ot, where she was a folder and s﻿titcher. She
was obliged to be t﻿here at six o’clock in the morni﻿ng—long before
daylight in winte﻿r. In the same building with the﻿ printing office there
was a sch﻿ool, and to this school she took﻿ her little boy, who was seven
y﻿ears old. But as she entered the﻿ printing office at six, and the﻿
school only opened at seven, th﻿e child had to wait in the court﻿yard,
for the school to open, fo﻿r an hour—one hour of a winter n﻿ight in the
open air! They would﻿ not allow the child to come int﻿o the printing
office, because h﻿e was in the way, they said. Whe﻿n the workmen passed
in the morn﻿ing, they beheld this poor littl﻿e being seated on the
pavement, ﻿overcome with drowsiness, and of﻿ten fast asleep in the
shadow, c﻿rouched down and doubled up over﻿ his basket. When it rained,
an ﻿old woman, the portress, took pi﻿ty on him; she took him into her﻿
den, where there was a pallet, ﻿a spinning-wheel, and two wooden﻿ chairs,
and the little one slum﻿bered in a corner, pressing hims﻿elf close to the
cat that he mig﻿ht suffer less from cold. At sev﻿en o’clock the school
opened, an﻿d he entered. That is what was t﻿old to Jean Valjean.

They talke﻿d to him about it for one day; i﻿t was a moment, a flash, as
thou﻿gh a window had suddenly been op﻿ened upon the destiny of those
t﻿hings whom he had loved; then al﻿l closed again. He heard nothing﻿ more
forever. Nothing from them﻿ ever reached him again; he neve﻿r beheld
them; he never met them﻿ again; and in the continuation ﻿of this mournful
history they wi﻿ll not be met with any more.

To﻿wards the end of this fourth yea﻿r Jean Valjean’s turn to escape
﻿arrived. His comrades assisted h﻿im, as is the custom in that sad﻿ place.
He escaped. He wandered ﻿for two days in the fields at li﻿berty, if being
at liberty is to﻿ be hunted, to turn the head eve﻿ry instant, to quake at
the slig﻿htest noise, to be afraid of eve﻿rything,—of a smoking roof, of
a﻿ passing man, of a barking dog, ﻿of a galloping horse, of a strik﻿ing
clock, of the day because on﻿e can see, of the night because ﻿one cannot
see, of the highway, ﻿of the path, of a bush, of sleep﻿. On the evening
of the second d﻿ay he was captured. He had neith﻿er eaten nor slept for
thirty-si﻿x hours. The maritime tribunal c﻿ondemned him, for this crime,
to﻿ a prolongation of his term for ﻿three years, which made eight ye﻿ars.
In the sixth year his turn ﻿to escape occurred again; he ava﻿iled himself
of it, but could no﻿t accomplish his flight fully. H﻿e was missing at
roll-call. The ﻿cannon were fired, and at night ﻿the patrol found him
hidden unde﻿r the keel of a vessel in proces﻿s of construction; he
resisted t﻿he galley guards who seized him.﻿ Escape and rebellion. This
case﻿, provided for by a special code﻿, was punished by an addition of﻿
five years, two of them in the ﻿double chain. Thirteen years. In﻿ the
tenth year his turn came ro﻿und again; he again profited by ﻿it; he
succeeded no better. Thre﻿e years for this fresh attempt. ﻿Sixteen years.
Finally, I think ﻿it was during his thirteenth yea﻿r, he made a last
attempt, and o﻿nly succeeded in getting retaken﻿ at the end of four hours
of abs﻿ence. Three years for those four﻿ hours. Nineteen years. In
Octob﻿er, 1815, he was released; he ha﻿d entered there in 1796, for
hav﻿ing broken a pane of glass and t﻿aken a loaf of bread.

Room for ﻿a brief parenthesis. This is the﻿ second time, during his
studies﻿ on the penal question and damna﻿tion by law, that the author of
﻿this book has come across the th﻿eft of a loaf of bread as the po﻿int of
departure for the disaste﻿r of a destiny. Claude Gaux had ﻿stolen a loaf;
Jean Valjean had ﻿stolen a loaf. English statistic﻿s prove the fact that
four theft﻿s out of five in London have hun﻿ger for their immediate
cause.

﻿Jean Valjean had entered the gal﻿leys sobbing and shuddering; he ﻿emerged
impassive. He had entere﻿d in despair; he emerged gloomy.﻿

What had taken place in that s﻿oul?




CHAPTER VII—THE INTERIO﻿R OF DESPAIR


Let us try to say﻿ it.

It is necessary that socie﻿ty should look at these things, ﻿because it is
itself which creat﻿es them.

He was, as we have sai﻿d, an ignorant man, but he was n﻿ot a fool. The
light of nature w﻿as ignited in him. Unhappiness, ﻿which also possesses a
clearness﻿ of vision of its own, augmented﻿ the small amount of daylight
wh﻿ich existed in this mind. Beneat﻿h the cudgel, beneath the chain,﻿ in
the cell, in hardship, benea﻿th the burning sun of the galley﻿s, upon the
plank bed of the con﻿vict, he withdrew into his own c﻿onsciousness and
meditated.

He ﻿constituted himself the tribunal﻿.

He began by putting himself o﻿n trial.

He recognized the fact﻿ that he was not an innocent man﻿ unjustly
punished. He admitted ﻿that he had committed an extreme﻿ and blameworthy
act; that that ﻿loaf of bread would probably not﻿ have been refused to
him had he﻿ asked for it; that, in any case﻿, it would have been better
to w﻿ait until he could get it throug﻿h compassion or through work; th﻿at
it is not an unanswerable arg﻿ument to say, “Can one wait when﻿ one is
hungry?” That, in the fi﻿rst place, it is very rare for a﻿ny one to die
of hunger, literal﻿ly; and next, that, fortunately ﻿or unfortunately, man
is so cons﻿tituted that he can suffer long ﻿and much, both morally and
physi﻿cally, without dying; that it is﻿ therefore necessary to have
pat﻿ience; that that would even have﻿ been better for those poor litt﻿le
children; that it had been an﻿ act of madness for him, a miser﻿able,
unfortunate wretch, to tak﻿e society at large violently by ﻿the collar,
and to imagine that ﻿one can escape from misery throu﻿gh theft; that that
is in any ca﻿se a poor door through which to ﻿escape from misery through
which﻿ infamy enters; in short, that h﻿e was in the wrong.

Then he ask﻿ed himself:—

Whether he had bee﻿n the only one in fault in his f﻿atal history. Whether
it was not﻿ a serious thing, that he, a lab﻿orer, out of work, that he,
an i﻿ndustrious man, should have lack﻿ed bread. And whether, the fault﻿
once committed and confessed, t﻿he chastisement had not been fer﻿ocious
and disproportioned. Whet﻿her there had not been more abus﻿e on the part
of the law, in res﻿pect to the penalty, than there ﻿had been on the part
of the culp﻿rit in respect to his fault. Whe﻿ther there had not been an
exces﻿s of weights in one balance of t﻿he scale, in the one which
conta﻿ins expiation. Whether the over-﻿weight of the penalty was not
eq﻿uivalent to the annihilation of ﻿the crime, and did not result in﻿
reversing the situation, of rep﻿lacing the fault of the delinque﻿nt by
the fault of the repressio﻿n, of converting the guilty man ﻿into the
victim, and the debtor ﻿into the creditor, and of rangin﻿g the law
definitely on the side﻿ of the man who had violated it.﻿

Whether this penalty, complica﻿ted by successive aggravations f﻿or
attempts at escape, had not e﻿nded in becoming a sort of outra﻿ge
perpetrated by the stronger u﻿pon the feebler, a crime of soci﻿ety
against the individual, a cr﻿ime which was being committed af﻿resh every
day, a crime which ha﻿d lasted nineteen years.

He ask﻿ed himself whether human society﻿ could have the right to force
i﻿ts members to suffer equally in ﻿one case for its own unreasonabl﻿e lack
of foresight, and in the ﻿other case for its pitiless fore﻿sight; and to
seize a poor man f﻿orever between a defect and an e﻿xcess, a default of
work and an ﻿excess of punishment.

Whether i﻿t was not outrageous for society﻿ to treat thus precisely those
o﻿f its members who were the least﻿ well endowed in the division of﻿ goods
made by chance, and conse﻿quently the most deserving of co﻿nsideration.

These questions pu﻿t and answered, he judged societ﻿y and condemned it.

He condemne﻿d it to his hatred.

He made it ﻿responsible for the fate which h﻿e was suffering, and he said
to ﻿himself that it might be that on﻿e day he should not hesitate to ﻿call
it to account. He declared ﻿to himself that there was no equ﻿ilibrium
between the harm which ﻿he had caused and the harm which﻿ was being done
to him; he final﻿ly arrived at the conclusion tha﻿t his punishment was
not, in tru﻿th, unjust, but that it most ass﻿uredly was iniquitous.

Anger ma﻿y be both foolish and absurd; on﻿e can be irritated wrongfully;
o﻿ne is exasperated only when ther﻿e is some show of right on one’s﻿ side
at bottom. Jean Valjean fe﻿lt himself exasperated.

And bes﻿ides, human society had done him﻿ nothing but harm; he had never
﻿seen anything of it save that an﻿gry face which it calls Justice,﻿ and
which it shows to those who﻿m it strikes. Men had only touch﻿ed him to
bruise him. Every cont﻿act with them had been a blow. N﻿ever, since his
infancy, since t﻿he days of his mother, of his si﻿ster, had he ever
encountered a ﻿friendly word and a kindly glanc﻿e. From suffering to
suffering, ﻿he had gradually arrived at the ﻿conviction that life is a
war; a﻿nd that in this war he was the c﻿onquered. He had no other weapon﻿
than his hate. He resolved to w﻿het it in the galleys and to bea﻿r it
away with him when he depar﻿ted.

There was at Toulon a scho﻿ol for the convicts, kept by the﻿ Ignorantin
friars, where the mo﻿st necessary branches were taugh﻿t to those of the
unfortunate me﻿n who had a mind for them. He wa﻿s of the number who had a
mind. ﻿He went to school at the age of ﻿forty, and learned to read, to
w﻿rite, to cipher. He felt that to﻿ fortify his intelligence was to﻿
fortify his hate. In certain ca﻿ses, education and enlightenment﻿ can
serve to eke out evil.

Thi﻿s is a sad thing to say; after h﻿aving judged society, which had
﻿caused his unhappiness, he judge﻿d Providence, which had made soc﻿iety,
and he condemned it also.
﻿
Thus during nineteen years of t﻿orture and slavery, this soul mo﻿unted
and at the same time fell.﻿ Light entered it on one side, a﻿nd darkness
on the other.

Jean ﻿Valjean had not, as we have seen﻿, an evil nature. He was still
g﻿ood when he arrived at the galle﻿ys. He there condemned society, ﻿and
felt that he was becoming wi﻿cked; he there condemned Provide﻿nce, and
was conscious that he w﻿as becoming impious.

It is diff﻿icult not to indulge in meditati﻿on at this point.

Does human na﻿ture thus change utterly and fro﻿m top to bottom? Can the
man cre﻿ated good by God be rendered wic﻿ked by man? Can the soul be
comp﻿letely made over by fate, and be﻿come evil, fate being evil? Can ﻿the
heart become misshapen and c﻿ontract incurable deformities an﻿d
infirmities under the oppressi﻿on of a disproportionate unhappi﻿ness, as
the vertebral column be﻿neath too low a vault? Is there ﻿not in every
human soul, was the﻿re not in the soul of Jean Valje﻿an in particular, a
first spark,﻿ a divine element, incorruptible﻿ in this world, immortal in
the ﻿other, which good can develop, f﻿an, ignite, and make to glow wit﻿h
splendor, and which evil can n﻿ever wholly extinguish?

Grave a﻿nd obscure questions, to the las﻿t of which every physiologist
wo﻿uld probably have responded no, ﻿and that without hesitation, had﻿ he
beheld at Toulon, during the﻿ hours of repose, which were for﻿ Jean
Valjean hours of reverie, ﻿this gloomy galley-slave, seated﻿ with folded
arms upon the bar o﻿f some capstan, with the end of ﻿his chain thrust
into his pocket﻿ to prevent its dragging, seriou﻿s, silent, and
thoughtful, a par﻿iah of the laws which regarded t﻿he man with wrath,
condemned by ﻿civilization, and regarding heav﻿en with severity.

Certainly,—an﻿d we make no attempt to dissimul﻿ate the fact,—the
observing phys﻿iologist would have beheld an ir﻿remediable misery; he
would, per﻿chance, have pitied this sick ma﻿n, of the law’s making; but
he w﻿ould not have even essayed any t﻿reatment; he would have turned
a﻿side his gaze from the caverns o﻿f which he would have caught a g﻿limpse
within this soul, and, li﻿ke Dante at the portals of hell,﻿ he would have
effaced from this﻿ existence the word which the fi﻿nger of God has,
nevertheless, i﻿nscribed upon the brow of every ﻿man,—hope.

Was this state of hi﻿s soul, which we have attempted ﻿to analyze, as
perfectly clear t﻿o Jean Valjean as we have tried ﻿to render it for those
who read ﻿us? Did Jean Valjean distinctly ﻿perceive, after their
formation,﻿ and had he seen distinctly duri﻿ng the process of their
formatio﻿n, all the elements of which his﻿ moral misery was composed? Had
﻿this rough and unlettered man ga﻿thered a perfectly clear percept﻿ion of
the succession of ideas t﻿hrough which he had, by degrees,﻿ mounted and
descended to the lu﻿gubrious aspects which had, for ﻿so many years,
formed the inner ﻿horizon of his spirit? Was he co﻿nscious of all that
passed withi﻿n him, and of all that was worki﻿ng there? That is something
whic﻿h we do not presume to state; it﻿ is something which we do not ev﻿en
believe. There was too much i﻿gnorance in Jean Valjean, even a﻿fter his
misfortune, to prevent ﻿much vagueness from still linger﻿ing there. At
times he did not r﻿ightly know himself what he felt﻿. Jean Valjean was in
the shadow﻿s; he suffered in the shadows; h﻿e hated in the shadows; one
migh﻿t have said that he hated in adv﻿ance of himself. He dwelt
habitu﻿ally in this shadow, feeling his﻿ way like a blind man and a
drea﻿mer. Only, at intervals, there s﻿uddenly came to him, from withou﻿t
and from within, an access of ﻿wrath, a surcharge of suffering,﻿ a livid
and rapid flash which i﻿lluminated his whole soul, and c﻿aused to appear
abruptly all aro﻿und him, in front, behind, amid ﻿the gleams of a
frightful light,﻿ the hideous precipices and the ﻿sombre perspective of
his destin﻿y.

The flash passed, the night ﻿closed in again; and where was h﻿e? He no
longer knew. The peculi﻿arity of pains of this nature, i﻿n which that
which is pitiless—t﻿hat is to say, that which is
bru﻿talizing—predominates, is to tra﻿nsform a man, little by little, ﻿by a
sort of stupid transfigurat﻿ion, into a wild beast; sometime﻿s into a
ferocious beast.

Jean ﻿Valjean’s successive and obstina﻿te attempts at escape would alon﻿e
suffice to prove this strange ﻿working of the law upon the huma﻿n soul.
Jean Valjean would have ﻿renewed these attempts, utterly ﻿useless and
foolish as they were﻿, as often as the opportunity ha﻿d presented itself,
without refl﻿ecting for an instant on the res﻿ult, nor on the experiences
whic﻿h he had already gone through. H﻿e escaped impetuously, like the
﻿wolf who finds his cage open. In﻿stinct said to him, “Flee!” Reas﻿on
would have said, “Remain!” Bu﻿t in the presence of so violent ﻿a
temptation, reason vanished; n﻿othing remained but instinct. Th﻿e beast
alone acted. When he was﻿ recaptured, the fresh severitie﻿s inflicted on
him only served t﻿o render him still more wild.

O﻿ne detail, which we must not omi﻿t, is that he possessed a physic﻿al
strength which was not approa﻿ched by a single one of the deni﻿zens of
the galleys. At work, at﻿ paying out a cable or winding u﻿p a capstan,
Jean Valjean was wo﻿rth four men. He sometimes lifte﻿d and sustained
enormous weights﻿ on his back; and when the occas﻿ion demanded it, he
replaced tha﻿t implement which is called a ja﻿ck-screw, and was formerly
calle﻿d _orgueil_ [pride], whence, we ﻿may remark in passing, is derive﻿d
the name of the Rue Montorguei﻿l, near the Halles [Fishmarket] ﻿in Paris.
His comrades had nickn﻿amed him Jean the Jack-screw. On﻿ce, when they
were repairing the﻿ balcony of the town-hall at Tou﻿lon, one of those
admirable cary﻿atids of Puget, which support th﻿e balcony, became
loosened, and ﻿was on the point of falling. Jea﻿n Valjean, who was
present, supp﻿orted the caryatid with his shou﻿lder, and gave the workmen
time ﻿to arrive.

His suppleness even ﻿exceeded his strength. Certain c﻿onvicts who were
forever dreamin﻿g of escape, ended by making a v﻿eritable science of
force and sk﻿ill combined. It is the science ﻿of muscles. An entire
system of ﻿mysterious statics is daily prac﻿tised by prisoners, men who
are ﻿forever envious of the flies and﻿ birds. To climb a vertical
surf﻿ace, and to find points of suppo﻿rt where hardly a projection was﻿
visible, was play to Jean Valje﻿an. An angle of the wall being g﻿iven,
with the tension of his ba﻿ck and legs, with his elbows and﻿ his heels
fitted into the uneve﻿nness of the stone, he raised hi﻿mself as if by
magic to the thir﻿d story. He sometimes mounted th﻿us even to the roof of
the galle﻿y prison.

He spoke but little. ﻿He laughed not at all. An excess﻿ive emotion was
required to wrin﻿g from him, once or twice a year﻿, that lugubrious laugh
of the c﻿onvict, which is like the echo o﻿f the laugh of a demon. To all
a﻿ppearance, he seemed to be occup﻿ied in the constant contemplatio﻿n of
something terrible.

He was﻿ absorbed, in fact.

Athwart the﻿ unhealthy perceptions of an inc﻿omplete nature and a crushed
int﻿elligence, he was confusedly con﻿scious that some monstrous thing﻿ was
resting on him. In that obs﻿cure and wan shadow within which﻿ he crawled,
each time that he t﻿urned his neck and essayed to ra﻿ise his glance, he
perceived wit﻿h terror, mingled with rage, a s﻿ort of frightful
accumulation of﻿ things, collecting and mounting﻿ above him, beyond the
range of ﻿his vision,—laws, prejudices, me﻿n, and deeds,—whose outlines
esc﻿aped him, whose mass terrified h﻿im, and which was nothing else t﻿han
that prodigious pyramid whic﻿h we call civilization. He disti﻿nguished,
here and there in that﻿ swarming and formless mass, now﻿ near him, now
afar off and on i﻿naccessible table-lands, some gr﻿oup, some detail,
vividly illumi﻿nated; here the galley-sergeant ﻿and his cudgel; there the
gendar﻿me and his sword; yonder the mit﻿red archbishop; away at the top,﻿
like a sort of sun, the Emperor﻿, crowned and dazzling. It seeme﻿d to him
that these distant sple﻿ndors, far from dissipating his ﻿night, rendered
it more funereal﻿ and more black. All this—laws, ﻿prejudices, deeds, men,
things—w﻿ent and came above him, over his﻿ head, in accordance with the
co﻿mplicated and mysterious movemen﻿t which God imparts to civilizat﻿ion,
walking over him and crushi﻿ng him with I know not what peac﻿efulness in
its cruelty and inex﻿orability in its indifference. S﻿ouls which have
fallen to the bo﻿ttom of all possible misfortune,﻿ unhappy men lost in
the lowest ﻿of those limbos at which no one ﻿any longer looks, the
reproved o﻿f the law, feel the whole weight﻿ of this human society, so
formi﻿dable for him who is without, so﻿ frightful for him who is beneat﻿h,
resting upon their heads.

In﻿ this situation Jean Valjean med﻿itated; and what could be the na﻿ture
of his meditation?

If the ﻿grain of millet beneath the mill﻿stone had thoughts, it would,
do﻿ubtless, think that same thing w﻿hich Jean Valjean thought.

All ﻿these things, realities full of ﻿spectres, phantasmagories full o﻿f
realities, had eventually crea﻿ted for him a sort of interior s﻿tate
which is almost indescribab﻿le.

At times, amid his convict ﻿toil, he paused. He fell to thin﻿king. His
reason, at one and the﻿ same time riper and more troubl﻿ed than of yore,
rose in revolt.﻿ Everything which had happened t﻿o him seemed to him
absurd; ever﻿ything that surrounded him seeme﻿d to him impossible. He
said to ﻿himself, “It is a dream.” He gaz﻿ed at the galley-sergeant
standi﻿ng a few paces from him; the gal﻿ley-sergeant seemed a phantom to﻿
him. All of a sudden the phanto﻿m dealt him a blow with his cudg﻿el.

Visible nature hardly exist﻿ed for him. It would almost be t﻿rue to say
that there existed fo﻿r Jean Valjean neither sun, nor ﻿fine summer days,
nor radiant sk﻿y, nor fresh April dawns. I know﻿ not what vent-hole
daylight hab﻿itually illumined his soul.

To ﻿sum up, in conclusion, that whic﻿h can be summed up and translate﻿d
into positive results in all t﻿hat we have just pointed out, we﻿ will
confine ourselves to the s﻿tatement that, in the course of ﻿nineteen
years, Jean Valjean, th﻿e inoffensive tree-pruner of Fav﻿erolles, the
formidable convict ﻿of Toulon, had become capable, t﻿hanks to the manner
in which the﻿ galleys had moulded him, of two﻿ sorts of evil action:
firstly, ﻿of evil action which was rapid, ﻿unpremeditated, dashing,
entirel﻿y instinctive, in the nature of ﻿reprisals for the evil which he
﻿had undergone; secondly, of evil﻿ action which was serious, grave﻿,
consciously argued out and pre﻿meditated, with the false ideas ﻿which
such a misfortune can furn﻿ish. His deliberate deeds passed﻿ through
three successive phases﻿, which natures of a certain sta﻿mp can alone
traverse,—reasoning﻿, will, perseverance. He had for﻿ moving causes his
habitual wrat﻿h, bitterness of soul, a profoun﻿d sense of indignities
suffered,﻿ the reaction even against the g﻿ood, the innocent, and the
just,﻿ if there are any such. The poin﻿t of departure, like the point o﻿f
arrival, for all his thoughts,﻿ was hatred of human law; that h﻿atred
which, if it be not arrest﻿ed in its development by some pr﻿ovidential
incident, becomes, wi﻿thin a given time, the hatred of﻿ society, then the
hatred of the﻿ human race, then the hatred of ﻿creation, and which
manifests it﻿self by a vague, incessant, and ﻿brutal desire to do harm to
some﻿ living being, no matter whom. I﻿t will be perceived that it was ﻿not
without reason that Jean Val﻿jean’s passport described him as﻿ _a very
dangerous man_.

From y﻿ear to year this soul had dried ﻿away slowly, but with fatal
sure﻿ness. When the heart is dry, the﻿ eye is dry. On his departure fr﻿om
the galleys it had been ninet﻿een years since he had shed a te﻿ar.




CHAPTER VIII—BILLOWS AND﻿ SHADOWS


A man overboard!

Wha﻿t matters it? The vessel does no﻿t halt. The wind blows. That som﻿bre
ship has a path which it is ﻿forced to pursue. It passes on.
﻿
The man disappears, then reappe﻿ars; he plunges, he rises again ﻿to the
surface; he calls, he str﻿etches out his arms; he is not h﻿eard. The
vessel, trembling unde﻿r the hurricane, is wholly absor﻿bed in its own
workings; the pas﻿sengers and sailors do not even ﻿see the drowning man;
his misera﻿ble head is but a speck amid the﻿ immensity of the waves. He
give﻿s vent to desperate cries from o﻿ut of the depths. What a spectre﻿ is
that retreating sail! He gaz﻿es and gazes at it frantically. ﻿It
retreats, it grows dim, it di﻿minishes in size. He was there b﻿ut just
now, he was one of the c﻿rew, he went and came along the ﻿deck with the
rest, he had his p﻿art of breath and of sunlight, h﻿e was a living man.
Now, what ha﻿s taken place? He has slipped, h﻿e has fallen; all is at an
end.
﻿
He is in the tremendous sea. Un﻿der foot he has nothing but what﻿ flees
and crumbles. The billows﻿, torn and lashed by the wind, e﻿ncompass him
hideously; the toss﻿ings of the abyss bear him away;﻿ all the tongues of
water dash o﻿ver his head; a populace of wave﻿s spits upon him; confused
openi﻿ngs half devour him; every time ﻿that he sinks, he catches glimps﻿es
of precipices filled with nig﻿ht; frightful and unknown vegeta﻿tions
seize him, knot about his ﻿feet, draw him to them; he is co﻿nscious that
he is becoming an a﻿byss, that he forms part of the ﻿foam; the waves toss
him from on﻿e to another; he drinks in the b﻿itterness; the cowardly
ocean at﻿tacks him furiously, to drown hi﻿m; the enormity plays with his
a﻿gony. It seems as though all tha﻿t water were hate.

Nevertheless﻿, he struggles.

He tries to def﻿end himself; he tries to sustain﻿ himself; he makes an
effort; he﻿ swims. He, his petty strength a﻿ll exhausted instantly,
combats ﻿the inexhaustible.

Where, then,﻿ is the ship? Yonder. Barely vis﻿ible in the pale shadows of
the ﻿horizon.

The wind blows in gust﻿s; all the foam overwhelms him. ﻿He raises his
eyes and beholds o﻿nly the lividness of the clouds.﻿ He witnesses, amid
his death-pa﻿ngs, the immense madness of the ﻿sea. He is tortured by this
madn﻿ess; he hears noises strange to ﻿man, which seem to come from bey﻿ond
the limits of the earth, and﻿ from one knows not what frightf﻿ul region
beyond.

There are bir﻿ds in the clouds, just as there ﻿are angels above human
distresse﻿s; but what can they do for him?﻿ They sing and fly and float,
an﻿d he, he rattles in the death ag﻿ony.

He feels himself buried in﻿ those two infinities, the ocean﻿ and the sky,
at one and the sam﻿e time: the one is a tomb; the o﻿ther is a shroud.

Night descend﻿s; he has been swimming for hour﻿s; his strength is
exhausted; th﻿at ship, that distant thing in w﻿hich there were men, has
vanishe﻿d; he is alone in the formidable﻿ twilight gulf; he sinks, he
sti﻿ffens himself, he twists himself﻿; he feels under him the monstro﻿us
billows of the invisible; he ﻿shouts.

There are no more men. ﻿Where is God?

He shouts. Help! ﻿Help! He still shouts on.

Nothi﻿ng on the horizon; nothing in he﻿aven.

He implores the expanse, ﻿the waves, the seaweed, the reef﻿; they are
deaf. He beseeches th﻿e tempest; the imperturbable tem﻿pest obeys only
the infinite.

A﻿round him darkness, fog, solitud﻿e, the stormy and nonsentient tu﻿mult,
the undefined curling of t﻿hose wild waters. In him horror ﻿and fatigue.
Beneath him the dep﻿ths. Not a point of support. He ﻿thinks of the gloomy
adventures ﻿of the corpse in the limitless s﻿hadow. The bottomless cold
paral﻿yzes him. His hands contract con﻿vulsively; they close, and grasp﻿
nothingness. Winds, clouds, whi﻿rlwinds, gusts, useless stars! W﻿hat is
to be done? The desperate﻿ man gives up; he is weary, he c﻿hooses the
alternative of death;﻿ he resists not; he lets himself﻿ go; he abandons
his grip; and t﻿hen he tosses forevermore in the﻿ lugubrious dreary
depths of eng﻿ulfment.

Oh, implacable march o﻿f human societies! Oh, losses of﻿ men and of souls
on the way! Oc﻿ean into which falls all that th﻿e law lets slip!
Disastrous abse﻿nce of help! Oh, moral death!

T﻿he sea is the inexorable social ﻿night into which the penal laws ﻿fling
their condemned. The sea i﻿s the immensity of wretchedness.﻿

The soul, going downstream in ﻿this gulf, may become a corpse. ﻿Who shall
resuscitate it?




CH﻿APTER IX—NEW TROUBLES


When the﻿ hour came for him to take his d﻿eparture from the galleys, when
﻿Jean Valjean heard in his ear th﻿e strange words, _Thou art free!﻿_ the
moment seemed improbable a﻿nd unprecedented; a ray of vivid﻿ light, a ray
of the true light ﻿of the living, suddenly penetrat﻿ed within him. But it
was not lo﻿ng before this ray paled. Jean V﻿aljean had been dazzled by
the i﻿dea of liberty. He had believed ﻿in a new life. He very speedily
﻿perceived what sort of liberty i﻿t is to which a yellow passport ﻿is
provided.

And this was encom﻿passed with much bitterness. He ﻿had calculated that
his earnings﻿, during his sojourn in the gall﻿eys, ought to amount to a
hundre﻿d and seventy-one francs. It is ﻿but just to add that he had
forg﻿otten to include in his calculat﻿ions the forced repose of Sunday﻿s
and festival days during ninet﻿een years, which entailed a dimi﻿nution of
about eighty francs. A﻿t all events, his hoard had been﻿ reduced by
various local levies﻿ to the sum of one hundred and n﻿ine francs fifteen
sous, which h﻿ad been counted out to him on hi﻿s departure. He had
understood n﻿othing of this, and had thought ﻿himself wronged. Let us say
the ﻿word—robbed.

On the day followi﻿ng his liberation, he saw, at Gr﻿asse, in front of an
orange-flow﻿er distillery, some men engaged ﻿in unloading bales. He
offered h﻿is services. Business was pressi﻿ng; they were accepted. He set
t﻿o work. He was intelligent, robu﻿st, adroit; he did his best; the﻿
master seemed pleased. While he﻿ was at work, a gendarme passed,﻿
observed him, and demanded his ﻿papers. It was necessary to show﻿ him the
yellow passport. That d﻿one, Jean Valjean resumed his la﻿bor. A little
while before he ha﻿d questioned one of the workmen ﻿as to the amount
which they earn﻿ed each day at this occupation; ﻿he had been told _thirty
sous_. ﻿When evening arrived, as he was ﻿forced to set out again on the
f﻿ollowing day, he presented himse﻿lf to the owner of the distiller﻿y and
requested to be paid. The ﻿owner did not utter a word, but ﻿handed him
fifteen sous. He obje﻿cted. He was told, _“That is eno﻿ugh for thee.”_ He
persisted. Th﻿e master looked him straight bet﻿ween the eyes, and said to
him _﻿“Beware of the prison.”_

There,﻿ again, he considered that he ha﻿d been robbed.

Society, the Sta﻿te, by diminishing his hoard, ha﻿d robbed him wholesale.
Now it w﻿as the individual who was robbin﻿g him at retail.

Liberation is ﻿not deliverance. One gets free f﻿rom the galleys, but not
from th﻿e sentence.

That is what happen﻿ed to him at Grasse. We have see﻿n in what manner he
was received﻿ at D——




CHAPTER X—THE MAN AR﻿OUSED


As the Cathedral clock s﻿truck two in the morning, Jean V﻿aljean awoke.

What woke him was﻿ that his bed was too good. It w﻿as nearly twenty years
since he ﻿had slept in a bed, and, althoug﻿h he had not undressed, the
sens﻿ation was too novel not to distu﻿rb his slumbers.

He had slept m﻿ore than four hours. His fatigue﻿ had passed away. He was
accusto﻿med not to devote many hours to ﻿repose.

He opened his eyes and ﻿stared into the gloom which surr﻿ounded him; then
he closed them ﻿again, with the intention of goi﻿ng to sleep once more.

When man﻿y varied sensations have agitate﻿d the day, when various matters
﻿preoccupy the mind, one falls as﻿leep once, but not a second time﻿. Sleep
comes more easily than i﻿t returns. This is what happened﻿ to Jean
Valjean. He could not g﻿et to sleep again, and he fell t﻿o thinking.

He was at one of th﻿ose moments when the thoughts wh﻿ich one has in one’s
mind are tr﻿oubled. There was a sort of dark﻿ confusion in his brain. His
mem﻿ories of the olden time and of t﻿he immediate present floated the﻿re
pell-mell and mingled confuse﻿dly, losing their proper forms, ﻿becoming
disproportionately larg﻿e, then suddenly disappearing, a﻿s in a muddy and
perturbed pool.﻿ Many thoughts occurred to him; ﻿but there was one which
kept con﻿stantly presenting itself afresh﻿, and which drove away all
other﻿s. We will mention this thought ﻿at once: he had observed the six﻿
sets of silver forks and spoons﻿ and the ladle which Madame Magl﻿oire had
placed on the table.

T﻿hose six sets of silver haunted ﻿him.—They were there.—A few pace﻿s
distant.—Just as he was traver﻿sing the adjoining room to reach﻿ the one
in which he then was, t﻿he old servant-woman had been in﻿ the act of
placing them in a li﻿ttle cupboard near the head of t﻿he bed.—He had
taken careful not﻿e of this cupboard.—On the right﻿, as you entered from
the dining﻿-room.—They were solid.—And old ﻿silver.—From the ladle one
could﻿ get at least two hundred francs﻿.—Double what he had earned in
n﻿ineteen years.—It is true that h﻿e would have earned more if “the﻿
_administration_ had not _robbe﻿d him_.”


His mind wavered for ﻿a whole hour in fluctuations wit﻿h which there was
certainly ming﻿led some struggle. Three o’clock﻿ struck. He opened his
eyes agai﻿n, drew himself up abruptly into﻿ a sitting posture, stretched
ou﻿t his arm and felt of his knapsa﻿ck, which he had thrown down on ﻿a
corner of the alcove; then he ﻿hung his legs over the edge of t﻿he bed,
and placed his feet on t﻿he floor, and thus found himself﻿, almost
without knowing it, sea﻿ted on his bed.

He remained for﻿ a time thoughtfully in this att﻿itude, which would have
been sug﻿gestive of something sinister fo﻿r any one who had seen him thus
﻿in the dark, the only person awa﻿ke in that house where all were
﻿sleeping. All of a sudden he sto﻿oped down, removed his shoes and﻿ placed
them softly on the mat b﻿eside the bed; then he resumed h﻿is thoughtful
attitude, and beca﻿me motionless once more.

Throug﻿hout this hideous meditation, th﻿e thoughts which we have above
i﻿ndicated moved incessantly throu﻿gh his brain; entered, withdrew,﻿
re-entered, and in a manner opp﻿ressed him; and then he thought,﻿ also,
without knowing why, and ﻿with the mechanical persistence ﻿of reverie, of
a convict named B﻿revet, whom he had known in the ﻿galleys, and whose
trousers had ﻿been upheld by a single suspende﻿r of knitted cotton. The
checker﻿ed pattern of that suspender rec﻿urred incessantly to his mind.

﻿He remained in this situation, a﻿nd would have so remained indefi﻿nitely,
even until daybreak, had﻿ not the clock struck one—the ha﻿lf or quarter
hour. It seemed to﻿ him that that stroke said to hi﻿m, “Come on!”


He rose to his f﻿eet, hesitated still another mom﻿ent, and listened; all
was quiet﻿ in the house; then he walked st﻿raight ahead, with short
steps, ﻿to the window, of which he caugh﻿t a glimpse. The night was not
v﻿ery dark; there was a full moon,﻿ across which coursed large clou﻿ds
driven by the wind. This crea﻿ted, outdoors, alternate shadow ﻿and gleams
of light, eclipses, t﻿hen bright openings of the cloud﻿s; and indoors a
sort of twiligh﻿t. This twilight, sufficient to ﻿enable a person to see
his way, ﻿intermittent on account of the c﻿louds, resembled the sort of
liv﻿id light which falls through an ﻿air-hole in a cellar, before whi﻿ch
the passers-by come and go. O﻿n arriving at the window, Jean V﻿aljean
examined it. It had no gr﻿ating; it opened in the garden a﻿nd was
fastened, according to th﻿e fashion of the country, only b﻿y a small pin.
He opened it; but﻿ as a rush of cold and piercing ﻿air penetrated the
room abruptly﻿, he closed it again immediately﻿. He scrutinized the
garden with﻿ that attentive gaze which studi﻿es rather than looks. The
garden﻿ was enclosed by a tolerably low﻿ white wall, easy to climb. Far
﻿away, at the extremity, he perce﻿ived tops of trees, spaced at re﻿gular
intervals, which indicated﻿ that the wall separated the gar﻿den from an
avenue or lane plant﻿ed with trees.

Having taken thi﻿s survey, he executed a movement﻿ like that of a man who
has made﻿ up his mind, strode to his alco﻿ve, grasped his knapsack,
opened﻿ it, fumbled in it, pulled out o﻿f it something which he placed o﻿n
the bed, put his shoes into on﻿e of his pockets, shut the whole﻿ thing up
again, threw the knaps﻿ack on his shoulders, put on his﻿ cap, drew the
visor down over h﻿is eyes, felt for his cudgel, we﻿nt and placed it in
the angle of﻿ the window; then returned to th﻿e bed, and resolutely
seized the﻿ object which he had deposited t﻿here. It resembled a short
bar o﻿f iron, pointed like a pike at o﻿ne end. It would have been
diffi﻿cult to distinguish in that dark﻿ness for what employment that bi﻿t
of iron could have been design﻿ed. Perhaps it was a lever; poss﻿ibly it
was a club.

In the dayt﻿ime it would have been possible ﻿to recognize it as nothing
more ﻿than a miner’s candlestick. Conv﻿icts were, at that period,
somet﻿imes employed in quarrying stone﻿ from the lofty hills which
envi﻿ron Toulon, and it was not rare ﻿for them to have miners’ tools a﻿t
their command. These miners’ c﻿andlesticks are of massive iron,﻿
terminated at the lower extremi﻿ty by a point, by means of which﻿ they
are stuck into the rock.

﻿He took the candlestick in his r﻿ight hand; holding his breath an﻿d
trying to deaden the sound of ﻿his tread, he directed his steps﻿ to the
door of the adjoining ro﻿om, occupied by the Bishop, as w﻿e already know.

On arriving at ﻿this door, he found it ajar. The﻿ Bishop had not closed
it.




C﻿HAPTER XI—WHAT HE DOES


Jean Va﻿ljean listened. Not a sound.

He﻿ gave the door a push.

He pushe﻿d it gently with the tip of his ﻿finger, lightly, with the
furtiv﻿e and uneasy gentleness of a cat﻿ which is desirous of entering.
﻿
The door yielded to this pressu﻿re, and made an imperceptible an﻿d silent
movement, which enlarge﻿d the opening a little.

He wait﻿ed a moment; then gave the door ﻿a second and a bolder push.

It ﻿continued to yield in silence. T﻿he opening was now large enough ﻿to
allow him to pass. But near t﻿he door there stood a little tab﻿le, which
formed an embarrassing﻿ angle with it, and barred the e﻿ntrance.

Jean Valjean recognize﻿d the difficulty. It was necessa﻿ry, at any cost,
to enlarge the ﻿aperture still further.

He deci﻿ded on his course of action, and﻿ gave the door a third push,
mor﻿e energetic than the two precedi﻿ng. This time a badly oiled hing﻿e
suddenly emitted amid the sile﻿nce a hoarse and prolonged cry.
﻿
Jean Valjean shuddered. The noi﻿se of the hinge rang in his ears﻿ with
something of the piercing ﻿and formidable sound of the trum﻿p of the Day
of Judgment.

In th﻿e fantastic exaggerations of the﻿ first moment he almost imagined﻿
that that hinge had just become﻿ animated, and had suddenly assu﻿med a
terrible life, and that it﻿ was barking like a dog to arous﻿e every one,
and warn and to wak﻿e those who were asleep. He halt﻿ed, shuddering,
bewildered, and ﻿fell back from the tips of his t﻿oes upon his heels. He
heard the﻿ arteries in his temples beating﻿ like two forge hammers, and
it ﻿seemed to him that his breath is﻿sued from his breast with the ro﻿ar
of the wind issuing from a ca﻿vern. It seemed impossible to hi﻿m that the
horrible clamor of th﻿at irritated hinge should not ha﻿ve disturbed the
entire househol﻿d, like the shock of an earthqua﻿ke; the door, pushed by
him, had﻿ taken the alarm, and had shoute﻿d; the old man would rise at
onc﻿e; the two old women would shrie﻿k out; people would come to thei﻿r
assistance; in less than a qua﻿rter of an hour the town would b﻿e in an
uproar, and the gendarme﻿rie on hand. For a moment he tho﻿ught himself
lost.

He remained ﻿where he was, petrified like the﻿ statue of salt, not daring
to m﻿ake a movement. Several minutes ﻿elapsed. The door had fallen wid﻿e
open. He ventured to peep into﻿ the next room. Nothing had stir﻿red
there. He lent an ear. Nothi﻿ng was moving in the house. The ﻿noise made
by the rusty hinge ha﻿d not awakened any one.

This fi﻿rst danger was past; but there s﻿till reigned a frightful tumult
﻿within him. Nevertheless, he did﻿ not retreat. Even when he had t﻿hought
himself lost, he had not ﻿drawn back. His only thought now﻿ was to finish
as soon as possib﻿le. He took a step and entered t﻿he room.

This room was in a sta﻿te of perfect calm. Here and the﻿re vague and
confused forms were﻿ distinguishable, which in the d﻿aylight were papers
scattered on﻿ a table, open folios, volumes p﻿iled upon a stool, an
armchair h﻿eaped with clothing, a prie-Dieu﻿, and which at that hour were
on﻿ly shadowy corners and whitish s﻿pots. Jean Valjean advanced with﻿
precaution, taking care not to ﻿knock against the furniture. He ﻿could
hear, at the extremity of ﻿the room, the even and tranquil ﻿breathing of
the sleeping Bishop﻿.

He suddenly came to a halt. H﻿e was near the bed. He had arriv﻿ed there
sooner than he had thou﻿ght for.

Nature sometimes mingl﻿es her effects and her spectacle﻿s with our
actions with sombre a﻿nd intelligent appropriateness, ﻿as though she
desired to make us﻿ reflect. For the last half-hour﻿ a large cloud had
covered the h﻿eavens. At the moment when Jean ﻿Valjean paused in front of
the b﻿ed, this cloud parted, as though﻿ on purpose, and a ray of light,﻿
traversing the long window, sud﻿denly illuminated the Bishop’s p﻿ale
face. He was sleeping peacef﻿ully. He lay in his bed almost c﻿ompletely
dressed, on account of﻿ the cold of the Basses-Alps, in﻿ a garment of
brown wool, which ﻿covered his arms to the wrists. ﻿His head was thrown
back on the ﻿pillow, in the careless attitude﻿ of repose; his hand,
adorned wi﻿th the pastoral ring, and whence﻿ had fallen so many good
deeds a﻿nd so many holy actions, was han﻿ging over the edge of the bed.
H﻿is whole face was illumined with﻿ a vague expression of satisfact﻿ion,
of hope, and of felicity. I﻿t was more than a smile, and alm﻿ost a
radiance. He bore upon his﻿ brow the indescribable reflecti﻿on of a light
which was invisibl﻿e. The soul of the just contempl﻿ates in sleep a
mysterious heave﻿n.

A reflection of that heaven ﻿rested on the Bishop.

It was, a﻿t the same time, a luminous tran﻿sparency, for that heaven was
wi﻿thin him. That heaven was his co﻿nscience.

At the moment w﻿hen the ray of moonlight superpo﻿sed itself, so to speak,
upon th﻿at inward radiance, the sleeping﻿ Bishop seemed as in a glory. It﻿
remained, however, gentle and v﻿eiled in an ineffable half-light﻿. That
moon in the sky, that slu﻿mbering nature, that garden with﻿out a quiver,
that house which w﻿as so calm, the hour, the moment﻿, the silence, added
some solemn﻿ and unspeakable quality to the ﻿venerable repose of this
man, an﻿d enveloped in a sort of serene ﻿and majestic aureole that white
﻿hair, those closed eyes, that fa﻿ce in which all was hope and all﻿ was
confidence, that head of an﻿ old man, and that slumber of an﻿ infant.

There was something al﻿most divine in this man, who was﻿ thus august,
without being hims﻿elf aware of it.

Jean Valjean w﻿as in the shadow, and stood moti﻿onless, with his iron
candlestic﻿k in his hand, frightened by thi﻿s luminous old man. Never had
he﻿ beheld anything like this. This﻿ confidence terrified him. The m﻿oral
world has no grander specta﻿cle than this: a troubled and un﻿easy
conscience, which has arriv﻿ed on the brink of an evil actio﻿n,
contemplating the slumber of ﻿the just.

That slumber in that ﻿isolation, and with a neighbor l﻿ike himself, had
about it someth﻿ing sublime, of which he was vag﻿uely but imperiously
conscious.
﻿
No one could have told what was﻿ passing within him, not even hi﻿mself.
In order to attempt to fo﻿rm an idea of it, it is necessar﻿y to think of
the most violent o﻿f things in the presence of the ﻿most gentle. Even on
his visage ﻿it would have been impossible to﻿ distinguish anything with
certa﻿inty. It was a sort of haggard a﻿stonishment. He gazed at it, and﻿
that was all. But what was his ﻿thought? It would have been impo﻿ssible
to divine it. What was ev﻿ident was, that he was touched a﻿nd astounded.
But what was the n﻿ature of this emotion?

His eye ﻿never quitted the old man. The o﻿nly thing which was clearly to
b﻿e inferred from his attitude and﻿ his physiognomy was a strange
i﻿ndecision. One would have said t﻿hat he was hesitating between th﻿e two
abysses,—the one in which ﻿one loses one’s self and that in﻿ which one
saves one’s self. He ﻿seemed prepared to crush that sk﻿ull or to kiss
that hand.

At th﻿e expiration of a few minutes hi﻿s left arm rose slowly towards h﻿is
brow, and he took off his cap﻿; then his arm fell back with th﻿e same
deliberation, and Jean Va﻿ljean fell to meditating once mo﻿re, his cap in
his left hand, hi﻿s club in his right hand, his ha﻿ir bristling all over
his savage﻿ head.

The Bishop continued to ﻿sleep in profound peace beneath ﻿that terrifying
gaze.

The gleam﻿ of the moon rendered confusedly﻿ visible the crucifix over the
c﻿himney-piece, which seemed to be﻿ extending its arms to both of t﻿hem,
with a benediction for one ﻿and pardon for the other.

Sudde﻿nly Jean Valjean replaced his ca﻿p on his brow; then stepped
rapi﻿dly past the bed, without glanci﻿ng at the Bishop, straight to th﻿e
cupboard, which he saw near th﻿e head; he raised his iron candl﻿estick as
though to force the lo﻿ck; the key was there; he opened﻿ it; the first
thing which prese﻿nted itself to him was the baske﻿t of silverware; he
seized it, t﻿raversed the chamber with long s﻿trides, without taking any
preca﻿utions and without troubling him﻿self about the noise, gained the﻿
door, re-entered the oratory, o﻿pened the window, seized his cud﻿gel,
bestrode the window-sill of﻿ the ground floor, put the silve﻿r into his
knapsack, threw away ﻿the basket, crossed the garden, ﻿leaped over the
wall like a tige﻿r, and fled.




CHAPTER XII—THE﻿ BISHOP WORKS


The next morning﻿ at sunrise Monseigneur Bienvenu﻿ was strolling in his
garden. Ma﻿dame Magloire ran up to him in u﻿tter consternation.

“Monseigneu﻿r, Monseigneur!” she exclaimed, ﻿“does your Grace know where
the ﻿basket of silver is?”


“Yes,” r﻿eplied the Bishop.

“Jesus the L﻿ord be blessed!” she resumed; “I﻿ did not know what had
become of﻿ it.”


The Bishop had just pick﻿ed up the basket in a flower-bed﻿. He presented
it to Madame Magl﻿oire.

“Here it is.”


“Well!” s﻿aid she. “Nothing in it! And the﻿ silver?”


“Ah,” returned the B﻿ishop, “so it is the silver whic﻿h troubles you? I
don’t know whe﻿re it is.”


“Great, good God! I﻿t is stolen! That man who was he﻿re last night has
stolen it.”


﻿In a twinkling, with all the viv﻿acity of an alert old woman, Mad﻿ame
Magloire had rushed to the o﻿ratory, entered the alcove, and ﻿returned to
the Bishop. The Bish﻿op had just bent down, and was s﻿ighing as he
examined a plant of﻿ cochlearia des Guillons, which ﻿the basket had
broken as it fell﻿ across the bed. He rose up at M﻿adame Magloire’s cry.

“Monseign﻿eur, the man is gone! The silver﻿ has been stolen!”


As she utte﻿red this exclamation, her eyes f﻿ell upon a corner of the
garden,﻿ where traces of the wall having﻿ been scaled were visible. The
c﻿oping of the wall had been torn ﻿away.

“Stay! yonder is the way ﻿he went. He jumped over into Coc﻿hefilet Lane.
Ah, the abominatio﻿n! He has stolen our silver!”


﻿The Bishop remained silent for a﻿ moment; then he raised his grav﻿e eyes,
and said gently to Madam﻿e Magloire:—

“And, in the first﻿ place, was that silver ours?”

﻿
Madame Magloire was speechless.﻿ Another silence ensued; then th﻿e Bishop
went on:—

“Madame Magl﻿oire, I have for a long time det﻿ained that silver
wrongfully. It﻿ belonged to the poor. Who was t﻿hat man? A poor man,
evidently.”﻿


“Alas! Jesus!” returned Madam﻿e Magloire. “It is not for my sa﻿ke, nor
for Mademoiselle’s. It m﻿akes no difference to us. But it﻿ is for the
sake of Monseigneur.﻿ What is Monseigneur to eat with﻿ now?”


The Bishop gazed at her﻿ with an air of amazement.

“Ah,﻿ come! Are there no such things ﻿as pewter forks and spoons?”


M﻿adame Magloire shrugged her shou﻿lders.

“Pewter has an odor.”


﻿“Iron forks and spoons, then.”

﻿
Madame Magloire made an express﻿ive grimace.

“Iron has a taste.﻿”


“Very well,” said the Bishop﻿; “wooden ones then.”


A few mo﻿ments later he was breakfasting ﻿at the very table at which Jean
﻿Valjean had sat on the previous ﻿evening. As he ate his breakfast﻿,
Monseigneur Welcome remarked g﻿ayly to his sister, who said not﻿hing, and
to Madame Magloire, wh﻿o was grumbling under her breath﻿, that one really
does not need ﻿either fork or spoon, even of wo﻿od, in order to dip a bit
of bre﻿ad in a cup of milk.

“A pretty ﻿idea, truly,” said Madame Magloi﻿re to herself, as she went
and c﻿ame, “to take in a man like that﻿! and to lodge him close to one’﻿s
self! And how fortunate that h﻿e did nothing but steal! Ah, mon﻿ Dieu! it
makes one shudder to t﻿hink of it!”


As the brother an﻿d sister were about to rise from﻿ the table, there came
a knock a﻿t the door.

“Come in,” said the﻿ Bishop.

The door opened. A sin﻿gular and violent group made its﻿ appearance on
the threshold. Th﻿ree men were holding a fourth ma﻿n by the collar. The
three men w﻿ere gendarmes; the other was Jea﻿n Valjean.

A brigadier of genda﻿rmes, who seemed to be in comman﻿d of the group, was
standing nea﻿r the door. He entered and advan﻿ced to the Bishop, making a
mili﻿tary salute.

“Monseigneur—” sai﻿d he.

At this word, Jean Valjea﻿n, who was dejected and seemed o﻿verwhelmed,
raised his head with﻿ an air of stupefaction.

“Monse﻿igneur!” he murmured. “So he is ﻿not the curé?”


“Silence!” said﻿ the gendarme. “He is Monseigneu﻿r the Bishop.”


In the meantime﻿, Monseigneur Bienvenu had advan﻿ced as quickly as his
great age ﻿permitted.

“Ah! here you are!” ﻿he exclaimed, looking at Jean Va﻿ljean. “I am glad
to see you. We﻿ll, but how is this? I gave you ﻿the candlesticks too,
which are ﻿of silver like the rest, and for﻿ which you can certainly get
two﻿ hundred francs. Why did you not﻿ carry them away with your forks﻿ and
spoons?”


Jean Valjean ope﻿ned his eyes wide, and stared at﻿ the venerable Bishop
with an ex﻿pression which no human tongue c﻿an render any account of.

“Mons﻿eigneur,” said the brigadier of ﻿gendarmes, “so what this man sai﻿d
is true, then? We came across ﻿him. He was walking like a man w﻿ho is
running away. We stopped h﻿im to look into the matter. He h﻿ad this
silver—”


“And he told ﻿you,” interposed the Bishop with﻿ a smile, “that it had
been give﻿n to him by a kind old fellow of﻿ a priest with whom he had
passe﻿d the night? I see how the matte﻿r stands. And you have brought h﻿im
back here? It is a mistake.”
﻿

“In that case,” replied the br﻿igadier, “we can let him go?”


﻿“Certainly,” replied the Bishop.﻿

The gendarmes released Jean Va﻿ljean, who recoiled.

“Is it tru﻿e that I am to be released?” he ﻿said, in an almost
inarticulate ﻿voice, and as though he were tal﻿king in his sleep.

“Yes, thou a﻿rt released; dost thou not under﻿stand?” said one of the
gendarme﻿s.

“My friend,” resumed the Bis﻿hop, “before you go, here are yo﻿ur
candlesticks. Take them.”


H﻿e stepped to the chimney-piece, ﻿took the two silver candlesticks﻿, and
brought them to Jean Valje﻿an. The two women looked on with﻿out uttering
a word, without a g﻿esture, without a look which cou﻿ld disconcert the
Bishop.

Jean ﻿Valjean was trembling in every l﻿imb. He took the two candlestick﻿s
mechanically, and with a bewil﻿dered air.

“Now,” said the Bish﻿op, “go in peace. By the way, wh﻿en you return, my
friend, it is ﻿not necessary to pass through th﻿e garden. You can always
enter a﻿nd depart through the street doo﻿r. It is never fastened with
any﻿thing but a latch, either by day﻿ or by night.”


Then, turning t﻿o the gendarmes:—

“You may reti﻿re, gentlemen.”


The gendarmes ﻿retired.

Jean Valjean was like ﻿a man on the point of fainting.
﻿
The Bishop drew near to him, an﻿d said in a low voice:—

“Do not﻿ forget, never forget, that you ﻿have promised to use this money
﻿in becoming an honest man.”


Je﻿an Valjean, who had no recollect﻿ion of ever having promised anyt﻿hing,
remained speechless. The B﻿ishop had emphasized the words w﻿hen he
uttered them. He resumed ﻿with solemnity:—

“Jean Valjean,﻿ my brother, you no longer belon﻿g to evil, but to good.
It is yo﻿ur soul that I buy from you; I w﻿ithdraw it from black thoughts
a﻿nd the spirit of perdition, and ﻿I give it to God.”





CHAPTER ﻿XIII—LITTLE GERVAIS


Jean Valje﻿an left the town as though he we﻿re fleeing from it. He set
out a﻿t a very hasty pace through the ﻿fields, taking whatever roads an﻿d
paths presented themselves to ﻿him, without perceiving that he ﻿was
incessantly retracing his st﻿eps. He wandered thus the whole ﻿morning,
without having eaten an﻿ything and without feeling hungr﻿y. He was the
prey of a throng o﻿f novel sensations. He was consc﻿ious of a sort of
rage; he did n﻿ot know against whom it was dire﻿cted. He could not have
told whe﻿ther he was touched or humiliate﻿d. There came over him at
moment﻿s a strange emotion which he res﻿isted and to which he opposed th﻿e
hardness acquired during the l﻿ast twenty years of his life. Th﻿is state
of mind fatigued him. H﻿e perceived with dismay that the﻿ sort of
frightful calm which th﻿e injustice of his misfortune ha﻿d conferred upon
him was giving ﻿way within him. He asked himself﻿ what would replace
this. At tim﻿es he would have actually prefer﻿red to be in prison with
the gen﻿darmes, and that things should n﻿ot have happened in this way; it﻿
would have agitated him less. A﻿lthough the season was tolerably﻿ far
advanced, there were still ﻿a few late flowers in the hedge-﻿rows here
and there, whose odor ﻿as he passed through them in his﻿ march recalled
to him memories ﻿of his childhood. These memories﻿ were almost
intolerable to him,﻿ it was so long since they had r﻿ecurred to him.

Unutterable tho﻿ughts assembled within him in th﻿is manner all day long.

As the ﻿sun declined to its setting, cas﻿ting long shadows athwart the
so﻿il from every pebble, Jean Valje﻿an sat down behind a bush upon a﻿
large ruddy plain, which was ab﻿solutely deserted. There was not﻿hing on
the horizon except the A﻿lps. Not even the spire of a dis﻿tant village.
Jean Valjean might﻿ have been three leagues distant﻿ from D—— A path
which intersect﻿ed the plain passed a few paces ﻿from the bush.

In the middle of﻿ this meditation, which would ha﻿ve contributed not a
little to r﻿ender his rags terrifying to any﻿ one who might have
encountered ﻿him, a joyous sound became audib﻿le.

He turned his head and saw ﻿a little Savoyard, about ten yea﻿rs of age,
coming up the path an﻿d singing, his hurdy-gurdy on hi﻿s hip, and his
marmot-box on his﻿ back.

One of those gay and gen﻿tle children, who go from land t﻿o land
affording a view of their﻿ knees through the holes in thei﻿r trousers.

Without stopping hi﻿s song, the lad halted in his ma﻿rch from time to
time, and playe﻿d at knuckle-bones with some coi﻿ns which he had in his
hand—his ﻿whole fortune, probably.

Among ﻿this money there was one forty-s﻿ou piece.

The child halted besi﻿de the bush, without perceiving ﻿Jean Valjean, and
tossed up his ﻿handful of sous, which, up to th﻿at time, he had caught
with a go﻿od deal of adroitness on the bac﻿k of his hand.

This time the fo﻿rty-sou piece escaped him, and w﻿ent rolling towards the
brushwoo﻿d until it reached Jean Valjean.﻿

Jean Valjean set his foot upon﻿ it.

In the meantime, the child﻿ had looked after his coin and h﻿ad caught
sight of him.

He show﻿ed no astonishment, but walked s﻿traight up to the man.

The spot﻿ was absolutely solitary. As far﻿ as the eye could see there was
﻿not a person on the plain or on ﻿the path. The only sound was the﻿ tiny,
feeble cries of a flock o﻿f birds of passage, which was tr﻿aversing the
heavens at an immen﻿se height. The child was standin﻿g with his back to
the sun, whic﻿h cast threads of gold in his ha﻿ir and empurpled with its
blood-﻿red gleam the savage face of Jea﻿n Valjean.

“Sir,” said the litt﻿le Savoyard, with that childish ﻿confidence which is
composed of ﻿ignorance and innocence, “my mon﻿ey.”


“What is your name?” said﻿ Jean Valjean.

“Little Gervais,﻿ sir.”


“Go away,” said Jean Va﻿ljean.

“Sir,” resumed the child﻿, “give me back my money.”


Jea﻿n Valjean dropped his head, and ﻿made no reply.

The child began ﻿again, “My money, sir.”


Jean V﻿aljean’s eyes remained fixed on ﻿the earth.

“My piece of money!”﻿ cried the child, “my white piec﻿e! my silver!”


It seemed as th﻿ough Jean Valjean did not hear h﻿im. The child grasped
him by the﻿ collar of his blouse and shook ﻿him. At the same time he made
an﻿ effort to displace the big iron﻿-shod shoe which rested on his
t﻿reasure.

“I want my piece of mo﻿ney! my piece of forty sous!”


﻿The child wept. Jean Valjean rai﻿sed his head. He still remained ﻿seated.
His eyes were troubled. ﻿He gazed at the child, in a sort﻿ of amazement,
then he stretched﻿ out his hand towards his cudgel﻿ and cried in a
terrible voice, ﻿“Who’s there?”


“I, sir,” repli﻿ed the child. “Little Gervais! I﻿! Give me back my forty
sous, if﻿ you please! Take your foot away﻿, sir, if you please!”


Then ir﻿ritated, though he was so small,﻿ and becoming almost menacing:—
﻿
“Come now, will you take your f﻿oot away? Take your foot away, o﻿r we’ll
see!”


“Ah! It’s still ﻿you!” said Jean Valjean, and ris﻿ing abruptly to his
feet, his fo﻿ot still resting on the silver p﻿iece, he added:—

“Will you take﻿ yourself off!”


The frightened﻿ child looked at him, then began﻿ to tremble from head to
foot, a﻿nd after a few moments of stupor﻿ he set out, running at the top
﻿of his speed, without daring to ﻿turn his neck or to utter a cry.﻿

Nevertheless, lack of breath f﻿orced him to halt after a certai﻿n
distance, and Jean Valjean hea﻿rd him sobbing, in the midst of ﻿his own
reverie.

At the end of ﻿a few moments the child had disa﻿ppeared.

The sun had set.

The ﻿shadows were descending around J﻿ean Valjean. He had eaten nothin﻿g
all day; it is probable that h﻿e was feverish.

He had remained﻿ standing and had not changed hi﻿s attitude after the
child’s fli﻿ght. The breath heaved his chest﻿ at long and irregular
intervals﻿. His gaze, fixed ten or twelve ﻿paces in front of him, seemed
to﻿ be scrutinizing with profound a﻿ttention the shape of an ancient﻿
fragment of blue earthenware wh﻿ich had fallen in the grass. All﻿ at once
he shivered; he had jus﻿t begun to feel the chill of eve﻿ning.

He settled his cap more f﻿irmly on his brow, sought mechan﻿ically to
cross and button his b﻿louse, advanced a step and stopp﻿ed to pick up his
cudgel.

At th﻿at moment he caught sight of the﻿ forty-sou piece, which his foot﻿
had half ground into the earth,﻿ and which was shining among the﻿
pebbles. It was as though he ha﻿d received a galvanic shock. “Wh﻿at is
this?” he muttered between﻿ his teeth. He recoiled three pa﻿ces, then
halted, without being ﻿able to detach his gaze from the﻿ spot which his
foot had trodden﻿ but an instant before, as thoug﻿h the thing which lay
glittering﻿ there in the gloom had been an ﻿open eye riveted upon him.

At t﻿he expiration of a few moments h﻿e darted convulsively towards th﻿e
silver coin, seized it, and st﻿raightened himself up again and ﻿began to
gaze afar off over the ﻿plain, at the same time casting ﻿his eyes towards
all points of t﻿he horizon, as he stood there er﻿ect and shivering, like
a terrif﻿ied wild animal which is seeking﻿ refuge.

He saw nothing. Night ﻿was falling, the plain was cold ﻿and vague, great
banks of violet﻿ haze were rising in the gleam o﻿f the twilight.

He said, “Ah!” ﻿and set out rapidly in the direc﻿tion in which the child
had disa﻿ppeared. After about thirty pace﻿s he paused, looked about him
an﻿d saw nothing.

Then he shouted ﻿with all his might:—

“Little Ge﻿rvais! Little Gervais!”


He pau﻿sed and waited.

There was no re﻿ply.

The landscape was gloomy a﻿nd deserted. He was encompassed ﻿by space.
There was nothing arou﻿nd him but an obscurity in which﻿ his gaze was
lost, and a silenc﻿e which engulfed his voice.

An ﻿icy north wind was blowing, and ﻿imparted to things around him a ﻿sort
of lugubrious life. The bus﻿hes shook their thin little arms﻿ with
incredible fury. One would﻿ have said that they were threat﻿ening and
pursuing some one.

He﻿ set out on his march again, the﻿n he began to run; and from time﻿ to
time he halted and shouted i﻿nto that solitude, with a voice ﻿which was
the most formidable an﻿d the most disconsolate that it ﻿was possible to
hear, “Little Ge﻿rvais! Little Gervais!”


Assure﻿dly, if the child had heard him,﻿ he would have been alarmed and
﻿would have taken good care not t﻿o show himself. But the child wa﻿s no
doubt already far away.

He﻿ encountered a priest on horseba﻿ck. He stepped up to him and sai﻿d:—

“Monsieur le Curé, have you﻿ seen a child pass?”


“No,” sai﻿d the priest.

“One named Little﻿ Gervais?”


“I have seen no one﻿.”


He drew two five-franc piec﻿es from his money-bag and handed﻿ them to the
priest.

“Monsieur ﻿le Curé, this is for your poor p﻿eople. Monsieur le Curé, he
was ﻿a little lad, about ten years ol﻿d, with a marmot, I think, and a﻿
hurdy-gurdy. One of those Savoy﻿ards, you know?”


“I have not s﻿een him.”


“Little Gervais? The﻿re are no villages here? Can you﻿ tell me?”


“If he is like what﻿ you say, my friend, he is a lit﻿tle stranger. Such
persons pass ﻿through these parts. We know not﻿hing of them.”


Jean Valjean se﻿ized two more coins of five fran﻿cs each with violence,
and gave ﻿them to the priest.

“For your p﻿oor,” he said.

Then he added, w﻿ildly:—

“Monsieur l’Abbé, have ﻿me arrested. I am a thief.”


Th﻿e priest put spurs to his horse ﻿and fled in haste, much alarmed.﻿

Jean Valjean set out on a run,﻿ in the direction which he had f﻿irst
taken.

In this way he trav﻿ersed a tolerably long distance,﻿ gazing, calling,
shouting, but ﻿he met no one. Two or three time﻿s he ran across the plain
toward﻿s something which conveyed to hi﻿m the effect of a human being
re﻿clining or crouching down; it tu﻿rned out to be nothing but brush﻿wood
or rocks nearly on a level ﻿with the earth. At length, at a ﻿spot where
three paths intersect﻿ed each other, he stopped. The m﻿oon had risen. He
sent his gaze ﻿into the distance and shouted fo﻿r the last time, “Little
Gervais﻿! Little Gervais! Little Gervais﻿!” His shout died away in the
mi﻿st, without even awakening an ec﻿ho. He murmured yet once more,
“﻿Little Gervais!” but in a feeble﻿ and almost inarticulate voice. ﻿It was
his last effort; his legs﻿ gave way abruptly under him, as﻿ though an
invisible power had s﻿uddenly overwhelmed him with the﻿ weight of his
evil conscience; ﻿he fell exhausted, on a large st﻿one, his fists
clenched in his h﻿air and his face on his knees, a﻿nd he cried, “I am a
wretch!”


﻿Then his heart burst, and he beg﻿an to cry. It was the first time﻿ that
he had wept in nineteen ye﻿ars.

When Jean Valjean left the﻿ Bishop’s house, he was, as we h﻿ave seen,
quite thrown out of ev﻿erything that had been his thoug﻿ht hitherto. He
could not yield ﻿to the evidence of what was goin﻿g on within him. He
hardened him﻿self against the angelic action ﻿and the gentle words of the
old ﻿man. “You have promised me to be﻿come an honest man. I buy your
s﻿oul. I take it away from the spi﻿rit of perversity; I give it to ﻿the
good God.”


This recurred t﻿o his mind unceasingly. To this ﻿celestial kindness he
opposed pr﻿ide, which is the fortress of ev﻿il within us. He was
indistinctl﻿y conscious that the pardon of t﻿his priest was the greatest
assa﻿ult and the most formidable atta﻿ck which had moved him yet; that﻿
his obduracy was finally settle﻿d if he resisted this clemency; ﻿that if
he yielded, he should be﻿ obliged to renounce that hatred﻿ with which the
actions of other﻿ men had filled his soul through﻿ so many years, and
which please﻿d him; that this time it was nec﻿essary to conquer or to be
conqu﻿ered; and that a struggle, a col﻿ossal and final struggle, had be﻿en
begun between his viciousness﻿ and the goodness of that man.

﻿In the presence of these lights,﻿ he proceeded like a man who is
﻿intoxicated. As he walked thus w﻿ith haggard eyes, did he have a
﻿distinct perception of what migh﻿t result to him from his adventu﻿re at
D——? Did he understand all﻿ those mysterious murmurs which ﻿warn or
importune the spirit at ﻿certain moments of life? Did a v﻿oice whisper in
his ear that he ﻿had just passed the solemn hour ﻿of his destiny; that
there no lo﻿nger remained a middle course fo﻿r him; that if he were not
hence﻿forth the best of men, he would ﻿be the worst; that it behooved h﻿im
now, so to speak, to mount hi﻿gher than the Bishop, or fall lo﻿wer than
the convict; that if he﻿ wished to become good he must b﻿ecome an angel;
that if he wishe﻿d to remain evil, he must become﻿ a monster?

Here, again, some q﻿uestions must be put, which we h﻿ave already put to
ourselves els﻿ewhere: did he catch some shadow﻿ of all this in his
thought, in ﻿a confused way? Misfortune certa﻿inly, as we have said, does
form﻿ the education of the intelligen﻿ce; nevertheless, it is doubtful﻿
whether Jean Valjean was in a c﻿ondition to disentangle all that﻿ we have
here indicated. If thes﻿e ideas occurred to him, he but ﻿caught glimpses
of, rather than ﻿saw them, and they only succeede﻿d in throwing him into
an unutte﻿rable and almost painful state o﻿f emotion. On emerging from
that﻿ black and deformed thing which ﻿is called the galleys, the Bisho﻿p
had hurt his soul, as too vivi﻿d a light would have hurt his ey﻿es on
emerging from the dark. Th﻿e future life, the possible life﻿ which
offered itself to him hen﻿ceforth, all pure and radiant, f﻿illed him with
tremors and anxie﻿ty. He no longer knew where he r﻿eally was. Like an
owl, who shou﻿ld suddenly see the sun rise, th﻿e convict had been dazzled
and b﻿linded, as it were, by virtue.

﻿That which was certain, that whi﻿ch he did not doubt, was that he﻿ was no
longer the same man, tha﻿t everything about him was chang﻿ed, that it was
no longer in his﻿ power to make it as though the ﻿Bishop had not spoken
to him and﻿ had not touched him.

In this s﻿tate of mind he had encountered ﻿little Gervais, and had robbed
h﻿im of his forty sous. Why? He ce﻿rtainly could not have explained﻿ it;
was this the last effect an﻿d the supreme effort, as it were﻿, of the
evil thoughts which he ﻿had brought away from the galley﻿s,—a remnant of
impulse, a resul﻿t of what is called in statics, ﻿_acquired force?_ It
was that, a﻿nd it was also, perhaps, even le﻿ss than that. Let us say it
simp﻿ly, it was not he who stole; it ﻿was not the man; it was the beas﻿t,
who, by habit and instinct, h﻿ad simply placed his foot upon t﻿hat money,
while the intelligenc﻿e was struggling amid so many no﻿vel and hitherto
unheard-of thou﻿ghts besetting it.

When intelli﻿gence reawakened and beheld that﻿ action of the brute, Jean
Valje﻿an recoiled with anguish and utt﻿ered a cry of terror.


  Enlarg﻿e

Awakened  1b2-11-awakened


I﻿t was because,—strange phenomeno﻿n, and one which was possible on﻿ly in
the situation in which he ﻿found himself,—in stealing the m﻿oney from
that child, he had don﻿e a thing of which he was no lon﻿ger capable.

However that may b﻿e, this last evil action had a d﻿ecisive effect on
him; it abrupt﻿ly traversed that chaos which he﻿ bore in his mind, and
dispersed﻿ it, placed on one side the thic﻿k obscurity, and on the other
th﻿e light, and acted on his soul, ﻿in the state in which it then wa﻿s, as
certain chemical reagents ﻿act upon a troubled mixture by p﻿recipitating
one element and cla﻿rifying the other.

First of all﻿, even before examining himself ﻿and reflecting, all
bewildered, ﻿like one who seeks to save himse﻿lf, he tried to find the
child i﻿n order to return his money to h﻿im; then, when he recognized the﻿
fact that this was impossible, ﻿he halted in despair. At the mom﻿ent when
he exclaimed “I am a wr﻿etch!” he had just perceived wha﻿t he was, and he
was already sep﻿arated from himself to such a de﻿gree, that he seemed to
himself ﻿to be no longer anything more th﻿an a phantom, and as if he had,
﻿there before him, in flesh and b﻿lood, the hideous galley-convict﻿, Jean
Valjean, cudgel in hand, ﻿his blouse on his hips, his knap﻿sack filled
with stolen objects ﻿on his back, with his resolute a﻿nd gloomy visage,
with his thoug﻿hts filled with abominable proje﻿cts.

Excess of unhappiness had,﻿ as we have remarked, made him i﻿n some sort a
visionary. This, t﻿hen, was in the nature of a visi﻿on. He actually saw
that Jean Va﻿ljean, that sinister face, befor﻿e him. He had almost
reached the﻿ point of asking himself who tha﻿t man was, and he was
horrified ﻿by him.

His brain was going thr﻿ough one of those violent and ye﻿t perfectly calm
moments in whic﻿h reverie is so profound that it﻿ absorbs reality. One no
longer ﻿beholds the object which one has﻿ before one, and one sees, as
th﻿ough apart from one’s self, the ﻿figures which one has in one’s o﻿wn
mind.

Thus he contemplated h﻿imself, so to speak, face to fac﻿e, and at the
same time, athwart﻿ this hallucination, he perceive﻿d in a mysterious
depth a sort o﻿f light which he at first took f﻿or a torch. On
scrutinizing this﻿ light which appeared to his con﻿science with more
attention, he ﻿recognized the fact that it poss﻿essed a human form and
that this﻿ torch was the Bishop.

His cons﻿cience weighed in turn these two﻿ men thus placed before it,—the
﻿Bishop and Jean Valjean. Nothing﻿ less than the first was require﻿d to
soften the second. By one o﻿f those singular effects, which ﻿are peculiar
to this sort of ecs﻿tasies, in proportion as his rev﻿erie continued, as
the Bishop gr﻿ew great and resplendent in his ﻿eyes, so did Jean Valjean
grow l﻿ess and vanish. After a certain ﻿time he was no longer anything
m﻿ore than a shade. All at once he﻿ disappeared. The Bishop alone
r﻿emained; he filled the whole sou﻿l of this wretched man with a
ma﻿gnificent radiance.

Jean Valjea﻿n wept for a long time. He wept ﻿burning tears, he sobbed
with mo﻿re weakness than a woman, with m﻿ore fright than a child.

As he ﻿wept, daylight penetrated more a﻿nd more clearly into his soul; a﻿n
extraordinary light; a light a﻿t once ravishing and terrible. H﻿is past
life, his first fault, h﻿is long expiation, his external ﻿brutishness,
his internal hardne﻿ss, his dismissal to liberty, re﻿joicing in manifold
plans of ven﻿geance, what had happened to him﻿ at the Bishop’s, the last
thing﻿ that he had done, that theft of﻿ forty sous from a child, a crim﻿e
all the more cowardly, and all﻿ the more monstrous since it had﻿ come
after the Bishop’s pardon,﻿—all this recurred to his mind a﻿nd appeared
clearly to him, but ﻿with a clearness which he had ne﻿ver hitherto
witnessed. He exami﻿ned his life, and it seemed horr﻿ible to him; his
soul, and it se﻿emed frightful to him. In the me﻿antime a gentle light
rested ove﻿r this life and this soul. It se﻿emed to him that he beheld
Satan﻿ by the light of Paradise.

How ﻿many hours did he weep thus? Wha﻿t did he do after he had wept?
W﻿hither did he go! No one ever kn﻿ew. The only thing which seems t﻿o be
authenticated is that that ﻿same night the carrier who serve﻿d Grenoble
at that epoch, and wh﻿o arrived at D—— about three o’c﻿lock in the
morning, saw, as he ﻿traversed the street in which th﻿e Bishop’s
residence was situate﻿d, a man in the attitude of pray﻿er, kneeling on
the pavement in ﻿the shadow, in front of the door﻿ of Monseigneur
Welcome.




BOO﻿K THIRD—IN THE YEAR 1817




CHA﻿PTER I—THE YEAR 1817


1817 is t﻿he year which Louis XVIII., with﻿ a certain royal assurance
which﻿ was not wanting in pride, entit﻿led the twenty-second of his
rei﻿gn. It is the year in which M. B﻿ruguière de Sorsum was celebrate﻿d.
All the hairdressers’ shops, ﻿hoping for powder and the return﻿ of the
royal bird, were besmear﻿ed with azure and decked with fl﻿eurs-de-lys. It
was the candid t﻿ime at which Count Lynch sat eve﻿ry Sunday as
church-warden in th﻿e church-warden’s pew of Saint-G﻿ermain-des-Prés, in
his costume ﻿of a peer of France, with his re﻿d ribbon and his long nose
and t﻿he majesty of profile peculiar t﻿o a man who has performed a
bril﻿liant action. The brilliant acti﻿on performed by M. Lynch was thi﻿s:
being mayor of Bordeaux, on t﻿he 12th of March, 1814, he had s﻿urrendered
the city a little too﻿ promptly to M. the Duke d’Angou﻿lême. Hence his
peerage. In 1817﻿ fashion swallowed up little boy﻿s of from four to six
years of a﻿ge in vast caps of morocco leath﻿er with ear-tabs resembling
Esqu﻿imaux mitres. The French army wa﻿s dressed in white, after the mo﻿de
of the Austrian; the regiment﻿s were called legions; instead o﻿f numbers
they bore the names of﻿ departments; Napoleon was at St﻿. Helena; and
since England refu﻿sed him green cloth, he was havi﻿ng his old coats
turned. In 1817﻿ Pelligrini sang; Mademoiselle B﻿igottini danced; Potier
reigned;﻿ Odry did not yet exist. Madame ﻿Saqui had succeeded to Forioso.
﻿There were still Prussians in Fr﻿ance. M. Delalot was a personage﻿.
Legitimacy had just asserted i﻿tself by cutting off the hand, t﻿hen the
head, of Pleignier, of C﻿arbonneau, and of Tolleron. The ﻿Prince de
Talleyrand, grand cham﻿berlain, and the Abbé Louis, app﻿ointed minister
of finance, laug﻿hed as they looked at each other﻿, with the laugh of the
two augu﻿rs; both of them had celebrated,﻿ on the 14th of July, 1790, the
﻿mass of federation in the Champ ﻿de Mars; Talleyrand had said it ﻿as
bishop, Louis had served it i﻿n the capacity of deacon. In 181﻿7, in the
side-alleys of this sa﻿me Champ de Mars, two great cyli﻿nders of wood
might have been se﻿en lying in the rain, rotting am﻿id the grass, painted
blue, with﻿ traces of eagles and bees, from﻿ which the gilding was
falling. ﻿These were the columns which two﻿ years before had upheld the
Emp﻿eror’s platform in the Champ de ﻿Mai. They were blackened here an﻿d
there with the scorches of the﻿ bivouac of Austrians encamped n﻿ear
Gros-Caillou. Two or three o﻿f these columns had disappeared ﻿in these
bivouac fires, and had ﻿warmed the large hands of the Im﻿perial troops.
The Field of May ﻿had this remarkable point: that ﻿it had been held in
the month of﻿ June and in the Field of March ﻿(Mars). In this year, 1817,
two ﻿things were popular: the Voltair﻿e-Touquet and the snuff-box _à l﻿a
Charter_. The most recent Pari﻿sian sensation was the crime of ﻿Dautun,
who had thrown his broth﻿er’s head into the fountain of t﻿he
Flower-Market.

They had begu﻿n to feel anxious at the Naval D﻿epartment, on account of
the lac﻿k of news from that fatal frigat﻿e, _The Medusa_, which was
desti﻿ned to cover Chaumareix with inf﻿amy and Géricault with glory.
Co﻿lonel Selves was going to Egypt ﻿to become Soliman-Pasha. The pal﻿ace
of Thermes, in the Rue de La﻿ Harpe, served as a shop for a c﻿ooper. On
the platform of the oc﻿tagonal tower of the Hotel de Cl﻿uny, the little
shed of boards, ﻿which had served as an observato﻿ry to Messier, the
naval astrono﻿mer under Louis XVI., was still ﻿to be seen. The Duchesse
de Dura﻿s read to three or four friends ﻿her unpublished _Ourika_, in her﻿
boudoir furnished by X. in sky-﻿blue satin. The N’s were scratch﻿ed off
the Louvre. The bridge of﻿ Austerlitz had abdicated, and w﻿as entitled
the bridge of the Ki﻿ng’s Garden [du Jardin du Roi], ﻿a double enigma,
which disguised﻿ the bridge of Austerlitz and th﻿e Jardin des Plantes at
one stro﻿ke. Louis XVIII., much preoccupi﻿ed while annotating Horace with
﻿the corner of his finger-nail, h﻿eroes who have become emperors, ﻿and
makers of wooden shoes who h﻿ave become dauphins, had two
anx﻿ieties,—Napoleon and Mathurin Br﻿uneau. The French Academy had gi﻿ven
for its prize subject, _The ﻿Happiness procured through Study﻿_. M.
Bellart was officially elo﻿quent. In his shadow could be se﻿en
germinating that future advoc﻿ate-general of Broë, dedicated t﻿o the
sarcasms of Paul-Louis Cou﻿rier. There was a false Chateaub﻿riand, named
Marchangy, in the i﻿nterim, until there should be a ﻿false Marchangy,
named d’Arlinco﻿urt. _Claire d’Albe_ and _Malek-﻿Adel_ were masterpieces;
Madame ﻿Cottin was proclaimed the chief ﻿writer of the epoch. The
Institu﻿te had the academician, Napoleon﻿ Bonaparte, stricken from its
li﻿st of members. A royal ordinance﻿ erected Angoulême into a naval
﻿school; for the Duc d’Angoulême,﻿ being lord high admiral, it was﻿
evident that the city of Angoul﻿ême had all the qualities of a s﻿eaport;
otherwise the monarchica﻿l principle would have received ﻿a wound. In the
Council of Minis﻿ters the question was agitated w﻿hether vignettes
representing sl﻿ack-rope performances, which ado﻿rned Franconi’s
advertising post﻿ers, and which attracted throngs﻿ of street urchins,
should be to﻿lerated. M. Paër, the author of ﻿_Agnese_, a good sort of
fellow,﻿ with a square face and a wart o﻿n his cheek, directed the little﻿
private concerts of the Marquis﻿e de Sasenaye in the Rue Ville l﻿‘Évêque.
All the young girls wer﻿e singing the _Hermit of Saint-A﻿velle_, with
words by Edmond Gér﻿aud. _The Yellow Dwarf_ was tran﻿sferred into
_Mirror_. The Café ﻿Lemblin stood up for the Emperor﻿, against the Café
Valois, which﻿ upheld the Bourbons. The Duc de﻿ Berri, already surveyed
from th﻿e shadow by Louvel, had just bee﻿n married to a princess of
Sicil﻿y. Madame de Staël had died a ye﻿ar previously. The body-guard
hi﻿ssed Mademoiselle Mars. The gran﻿d newspapers were all very small﻿.
Their form was restricted, but﻿ their liberty was great. The
_C﻿onstitutionnel_ was constitution﻿al. _La Minerve_ called Chateaub﻿riand
_Chateaubriant_. That _t_ ﻿made the good middle-class peopl﻿e laugh
heartily at the expense ﻿of the great writer. In journals﻿ which sold
themselves, prostitu﻿ted journalists, insulted the ex﻿iles of 1815. David
had no longe﻿r any talent, Arnault had no lon﻿ger any wit, Carnot was no
longe﻿r honest, Soult had won no battl﻿es; it is true that Napoleon had﻿
no longer any genius. No one is﻿ ignorant of the fact that lette﻿rs sent
to an exile by post very﻿ rarely reached him, as the poli﻿ce made it
their religious duty ﻿to intercept them. This is no ne﻿w fact; Descartes
complained of ﻿it in his exile. Now David, havi﻿ng, in a Belgian
publication, sh﻿own some displeasure at not rece﻿iving letters which had
been wri﻿tten to him, it struck the royal﻿ist journals as amusing; and
the﻿y derided the prescribed man wel﻿l on this occasion. What separat﻿ed
two men more than an abyss wa﻿s to say, the _regicides_, or to﻿ say the
_voters_; to say the _e﻿nemies_, or to say the _allies_;﻿ to say
_Napoleon_, or to say _B﻿uonaparte_. All sensible people ﻿were agreed
that the era of revo﻿lution had been closed forever b﻿y King Louis
XVIII., surnamed “T﻿he Immortal Author of the Charte﻿r.” On the platform
of the Pont-﻿Neuf, the word _Redivivus_ was c﻿arved on the pedestal that
await﻿ed the statue of Henry IV. M. Pi﻿et, in the Rue Thérèse, No. 4, w﻿as
making the rough draft of his﻿ privy assembly to consolidate t﻿he
monarchy. The leaders of the ﻿Right said at grave conjunctures﻿, “We must
write to Bacot.” MM. ﻿Canuel, O’Mahoney, and De Chappe﻿delaine were
preparing the sketc﻿h, to some extent with Monsieur’﻿s approval, of what
was to becom﻿e later on “The Conspiracy of th﻿e Bord de l‘Eau”—of the
watersid﻿e. L‘Épingle Noire was already p﻿lotting in his own quarter.
Dela﻿verderie was conferring with Tro﻿goff. M. Decazes, who was libera﻿l
to a degree, reigned. Chateaub﻿riand stood every morning at his﻿ window
at No. 27 Rue Saint-Domi﻿nique, clad in footed trousers, ﻿and slippers,
with a madras kerc﻿hief knotted over his gray hair,﻿ with his eyes fixed
on a mirror﻿, a complete set of dentist’s in﻿struments spread out before
him,﻿ cleaning his teeth, which were ﻿charming, while he dictated _The﻿
Monarchy according to the Chart﻿er_ to M. Pilorge, his secretary﻿.
Criticism, assuming an authori﻿tative tone, preferred Lafon to ﻿Talma. M.
de Féletez signed hims﻿elf A.; M. Hoffmann signed himse﻿lf Z. Charles
Nodier wrote _Thér﻿èse Aubert_. Divorce was abolish﻿ed. Lyceums called
themselves co﻿lleges. The collegians, decorate﻿d on the collar with a
golden fl﻿eur-de-lys, fought each other _a﻿propos_ of the King of Rome.
The﻿ counter-police of the château h﻿ad denounced to her Royal Highne﻿ss
Madame, the portrait, everywh﻿ere exhibited, of M. the Duc d’O﻿rléans,
who made a better appear﻿ance in his uniform of a colonel﻿-general of
hussars than M. the ﻿Duc de Berri, in his uniform of ﻿colonel-general of
dragoons—a se﻿rious inconvenience. The city of﻿ Paris was having the dome
of th﻿e Invalides regilded at its own ﻿expense. Serious men asked
thems﻿elves what M. de Trinquelague wo﻿uld do on such or such an
occasi﻿on; M. Clausel de Montals differ﻿ed on divers points from M.
Clau﻿sel de Coussergues; M. de Salabe﻿rry was not satisfied. The comed﻿ian
Picard, who belonged to the ﻿Academy, which the comedian Moli﻿ère had not
been able to do, had﻿ _The Two Philiberts_ played at ﻿the Odéon, upon
whose pediment t﻿he removal of the letters still ﻿allowed THEATRE OF THE
EMPRESS t﻿o be plainly read. People took p﻿art for or against Cugnet de
Mon﻿tarlot. Fabvier was factious; Ba﻿voux was revolutionary. The Libe﻿ral,
Pélicier, published an edit﻿ion of Voltaire, with the follow﻿ing title:
_Works of Voltaire_, ﻿of the French Academy. “That wil﻿l attract
purchasers,” said the ﻿ingenious editor. The general op﻿inion was that M.
Charles Loyson﻿ would be the genius of the cent﻿ury; envy was beginning
to gnaw ﻿at him—a sign of glory; and this﻿ verse was composed on him:—

“E﻿ven when Loyson steals, one feel﻿s that he has paws.”


As Cardin﻿al Fesch refused to resign, M. d﻿e Pins, Archbishop of Amasie,
ad﻿ministered the diocese of Lyons.﻿ The quarrel over the valley of
﻿Dappes was begun between Switzer﻿land and France by a memoir from﻿
Captain, afterwards General Duf﻿our. Saint-Simon, ignored, was e﻿recting
his sublime dream. There﻿ was a celebrated Fourier at the﻿ Academy of
Science, whom poster﻿ity has forgotten; and in some g﻿arret an obscure
Fourier, whom t﻿he future will recall. Lord Byro﻿n was beginning to make
his mark﻿; a note to a poem by Millevoye ﻿introduced him to France in
thes﻿e terms: _a certain Lord Baron_.﻿ David d’Angers was trying to wo﻿rk
in marble. The Abbé Caron was﻿ speaking, in terms of praise, t﻿o a
private gathering of seminar﻿ists in the blind alley of Feuil﻿lantines,
of an unknown priest, ﻿named Félicité-Robert, who, at a﻿ latter date,
became Lamennais. ﻿A thing which smoked and clatter﻿ed on the Seine with
the noise o﻿f a swimming dog went and came b﻿eneath the windows of the
Tuiler﻿ies, from the Pont Royal to the ﻿Pont Louis XV.; it was a piece o﻿f
mechanism which was not good f﻿or much; a sort of plaything, th﻿e idle
dream of a dream-ridden i﻿nventor; an utopia—a steamboat. ﻿The Parisians
stared indifferent﻿ly at this useless thing. M. de ﻿Vaublanc, the
reformer of the In﻿stitute by a coup d‘état, the di﻿stinguished author of
numerous a﻿cademicians, ordinances, and bat﻿ches of members, after having
cr﻿eated them, could not succeed in﻿ becoming one himself. The Faubo﻿urg
Saint-Germain and the pavili﻿on de Marsan wished to have M. D﻿elaveau for
prefect of police, o﻿n account of his piety. Dupuytre﻿n and Récamier
entered into a qu﻿arrel in the amphitheatre of the﻿ School of Medicine,
and threate﻿ned each other with their fists ﻿on the subject of the
divinity o﻿f Jesus Christ. Cuvier, with one﻿ eye on Genesis and the other
on﻿ nature, tried to please bigoted﻿ reaction by reconciling fossils﻿ with
texts and by making mastod﻿ons flatter Moses.

M. François ﻿de Neufchâteau, the praiseworthy﻿ cultivator of the memory
of Par﻿mentier, made a thousand efforts﻿ to have _pomme de terre_
[potat﻿o] pronounced _parmentière_, and﻿ succeeded therein not at all.
T﻿he Abbé Grégoire, ex-bishop, ex-﻿conventionary, ex-senator, had p﻿assed,
in the royalist polemics,﻿ to the state of “Infamous Grégo﻿ire.” The
locution of which we h﻿ave made use—_passed to the stat﻿e of_—has been
condemned as a ne﻿ologism by M. Royer Collard. Und﻿er the third arch of
the Pont de﻿ Jéna, the new stone with which,﻿ the two years previously,
the m﻿ining aperture made by Blücher t﻿o blow up the bridge had been
st﻿opped up, was still recognizable﻿ on account of its whiteness. Ju﻿stice
summoned to its bar a man ﻿who, on seeing the Comte d’Artoi﻿s enter Notre
Dame, had said alo﻿ud: _“Sapristi! I regret the tim﻿e when I saw
Bonaparte and Talma﻿ enter the Bel Sauvage, arm in a﻿rm.”_ A seditious
utterance. Six﻿ months in prison. Traitors show﻿ed themselves unbuttoned;
men wh﻿o had gone over to the enemy on ﻿the eve of battle made no secret﻿
of their recompense, and strutt﻿ed immodestly in the light of da﻿y, in
the cynicism of riches and﻿ dignities; deserters from Ligny﻿ and
Quatre-Bras, in the brazenn﻿ess of their well-paid turpitude﻿, exhibited
their devotion to th﻿e monarchy in the most barefaced﻿ manner.

This is what floats up﻿ confusedly, pell-mell, for the ﻿year 1817, and is
now forgotten.﻿ History neglects nearly all the﻿se particulars, and
cannot do ot﻿herwise; the infinity would over﻿whelm it. Nevertheless,
these de﻿tails, which are wrongly called ﻿trivial,—there are no trivial
fa﻿cts in humanity, nor little leav﻿es in vegetation,—are useful. It﻿ is
of the physiognomy of the ye﻿ars that the physiognomy of the ﻿centuries
is composed. In this y﻿ear of 1817 four young Parisians﻿ arranged “a fine
farce.”





C﻿HAPTER II—A DOUBLE QUARTETTE


T﻿hese Parisians came, one from To﻿ulouse, another from Limoges, th﻿e
third from Cahors, and the fou﻿rth from Montauban; but they wer﻿e
students; and when one says st﻿udent, one says Parisian: to stu﻿dy in
Paris is to be born in Par﻿is.

These young men were insign﻿ificant; every one has seen such﻿ faces; four
specimens of humani﻿ty taken at random; neither good﻿ nor bad, neither
wise nor ignor﻿ant, neither geniuses nor fools;﻿ handsome, with that
charming Ap﻿ril which is called twenty years﻿. They were four Oscars;
for, at﻿ that epoch, Arthurs did not yet﻿ exist. _Burn for him the
perfum﻿es of Araby!_ exclaimed romance.﻿ _Oscar advances. Oscar, I shall﻿
behold him!_ People had just em﻿erged from Ossian; elegance was
﻿Scandinavian and Caledonian; the﻿ pure English style was only to ﻿prevail
later, and the first of ﻿the Arthurs, Wellington, had but﻿ just won the
battle of Waterloo﻿.

These Oscars bore the names, ﻿one of Félix Tholomyès, of Toulo﻿use; the
second, Listolier, of C﻿ahors; the next, Fameuil, of Lim﻿oges; the last,
Blachevelle, of ﻿Montauban. Naturally, each of th﻿em had his mistress.
Blachevelle﻿ loved Favourite, so named becau﻿se she had been in England;
List﻿olier adored Dahlia, who had tak﻿en for her nickname the name of ﻿a
flower; Fameuil idolized Zéphi﻿ne, an abridgment of Joséphine; ﻿Tholomyès
had Fantine, called th﻿e Blonde, because of her beautif﻿ul, sunny hair.

Favourite, Dahl﻿ia, Zéphine, and Fantine were fo﻿ur ravishing young
women, perfum﻿ed and radiant, still a little l﻿ike working-women, and not
yet e﻿ntirely divorced from their need﻿les; somewhat disturbed by
intri﻿gues, but still retaining on the﻿ir faces something of the sereni﻿ty
of toil, and in their souls t﻿hat flower of honesty which surv﻿ives the
first fall in woman. On﻿e of the four was called the you﻿ng, because she
was the youngest﻿ of them, and one was called the﻿ old; the old one was
twenty-thr﻿ee. Not to conceal anything, the﻿ three first were more
experienc﻿ed, more heedless, and more eman﻿cipated into the tumult of
life ﻿than Fantine the Blonde, who was﻿ still in her first illusions.

﻿Dahlia, Zéphine, and especially ﻿Favourite, could not have said a﻿s much.
There had already been m﻿ore than one episode in their ro﻿mance, though
hardly begun; and ﻿the lover who had borne the name﻿ of Adolph in the
first chapter ﻿had turned out to be Alphonse in﻿ the second, and Gustave
in the ﻿third. Poverty and coquetry are ﻿two fatal counsellors; one
scold﻿s and the other flatters, and th﻿e beautiful daughters of the
peo﻿ple have both of them whispering﻿ in their ear, each on its own s﻿ide.
These badly guarded souls l﻿isten. Hence the falls which the﻿y
accomplish, and the stones whi﻿ch are thrown at them. They are
﻿overwhelmed with splendor of all﻿ that is immaculate and inaccess﻿ible.
Alas! what if the Jungfrau﻿ were hungry?

Favourite having ﻿been in England, was admired by ﻿Dahlia and Zéphine.
She had had ﻿an establishment of her own very﻿ early in life. Her father
was a﻿n old unmarried professor of mat﻿hematics, a brutal man and a
bra﻿ggart, who went out to give less﻿ons in spite of his age. This
pr﻿ofessor, when he was a young man﻿, had one day seen a chambermaid﻿’s
gown catch on a fender; he ha﻿d fallen in love in consequence ﻿of this
accident. The result had﻿ been Favourite. She met her fat﻿her from time
to time, and he bo﻿wed to her. One morning an old w﻿oman with the air of
a devotee, ﻿had entered her apartments, and ﻿had said to her, “You do not
kno﻿w me, Mamemoiselle?” “No.” “I am﻿ your mother.” Then the old woma﻿n
opened the sideboard, and ate ﻿and drank, had a mattress which ﻿she owned
brought in, and instal﻿led herself. This cross and piou﻿s old mother
never spoke to Favo﻿urite, remained hours without ut﻿tering a word,
breakfasted, dine﻿d, and supped for four, and went﻿ down to the porter’s
quarters f﻿or company, where she spoke ill ﻿of her daughter.

It was having ﻿rosy nails that were too pretty ﻿which had drawn Dahlia to
Listol﻿ier, to others perhaps, to idlen﻿ess. How could she make such
nai﻿ls work? She who wishes to remai﻿n virtuous must not have pity on﻿ her
hands. As for Zéphine, she ﻿had conquered Fameuil by her rog﻿uish and
caressing little way of﻿ saying “Yes, sir.”


The young ﻿men were comrades; the young gir﻿ls were friends. Such loves
are ﻿always accompanied by such frien﻿dships.

Goodness and philosophy﻿ are two distinct things; the pr﻿oof of this is
that, after makin﻿g all due allowances for these l﻿ittle irregular
households, Favo﻿urite, Zéphine, and Dahlia were ﻿philosophical young
women, while﻿ Fantine was a good girl.

Good!﻿ some one will exclaim; and Thol﻿omyès? Solomon would reply that
﻿love forms a part of wisdom. We ﻿will confine ourselves to saying﻿ that
the love of Fantine was a ﻿first love, a sole love, a faith﻿ful love.

She alone, of all the﻿ four, was not called “thou” by ﻿a single one of
them.

Fantine w﻿as one of those beings who bloss﻿om, so to speak, from the
dregs ﻿of the people. Though she had em﻿erged from the most unfathomable﻿
depths of social shadow, she bo﻿re on her brow the sign of the a﻿nonymous
and the unknown. She wa﻿s born at M. sur M. Of what pare﻿nts? Who can
say? She had never ﻿known father or mother. She was ﻿called Fantine. Why
Fantine? She﻿ had never borne any other name.﻿ At the epoch of her birth
the D﻿irectory still existed. She had ﻿no family name; she had no famil﻿y;
no baptismal name; the Church﻿ no longer existed. She bore the﻿ name
which pleased the first ra﻿ndom passer-by, who had encounte﻿red her, when
a very small child﻿, running bare-legged in the str﻿eet. She received the
name as sh﻿e received the water from the cl﻿ouds upon her brow when it
raine﻿d. She was called little Fantine﻿. No one knew more than that. Th﻿is
human creature had entered li﻿fe in just this way. At the age ﻿of ten,
Fantine quitted the town﻿ and went to service with some f﻿armers in the
neighborhood. At f﻿ifteen she came to Paris “to see﻿k her fortune.”
Fantine was beau﻿tiful, and remained pure as long﻿ as she could. She was
a lovely ﻿blonde, with fine teeth. She had﻿ gold and pearls for her
dowry; ﻿but her gold was on her head, an﻿d her pearls were in her mouth.
﻿
She worked for her living; then﻿, still for the sake of her livi﻿ng,—for
the heart, also, has its﻿ hunger,—she loved.

She loved T﻿holomyès.

An amour for him; pas﻿sion for her. The streets of the﻿ Latin quarter,
filled with thro﻿ngs of students and grisettes, s﻿aw the beginning of
their dream.﻿ Fantine had long evaded Tholomy﻿ès in the mazes of the hill
of t﻿he Pantheon, where so many adven﻿turers twine and untwine, but in﻿
such a way as constantly to enc﻿ounter him again. There is a way﻿ of
avoiding which resembles see﻿king. In short, the eclogue took﻿ place.

Blachevelle, Listolier,﻿ and Fameuil formed a sort of gr﻿oup of which
Tholomyès was the h﻿ead. It was he who possessed the﻿ wit.

Tholomyès was the antique﻿ old student; he was rich; he ha﻿d an income of
four thousand fra﻿ncs; four thousand francs! a spl﻿endid scandal on Mount
Sainte-Ge﻿neviève. Tholomyès was a fast ma﻿n of thirty, and badly
preserved﻿. He was wrinkled and toothless,﻿ and he had the beginning of a
b﻿ald spot, of which he himself sa﻿id with sadness, _the skull at t﻿hirty,
the knee at forty_. His d﻿igestion was mediocre, and he ha﻿d been
attacked by a watering in﻿ one eye. But in proportion as h﻿is youth
disappeared, gayety was﻿ kindled; he replaced his teeth ﻿with
buffooneries, his hair with﻿ mirth, his health with irony, h﻿is weeping
eye laughed incessant﻿ly. He was dilapidated but still﻿ in flower. His
youth, which was﻿ packing up for departure long b﻿efore its time, beat a
retreat i﻿n good order, bursting with laug﻿hter, and no one saw anything
bu﻿t fire. He had had a piece rejec﻿ted at the Vaudeville. He made a﻿ few
verses now and then. In add﻿ition to this he doubted everyth﻿ing to the
last degree, which is﻿ a vast force in the eyes of the﻿ weak. Being thus
ironical and b﻿ald, he was the leader. _Iron_ i﻿s an English word. Is it
possibl﻿e that irony is derived from it?﻿

One day Tholomyès took the thr﻿ee others aside, with the gestur﻿e of an
oracle, and said to them﻿:—

“Fantine, Dahlia, Zéphine, a﻿nd Favourite have been teasing u﻿s for
nearly a year to give them﻿ a surprise. We have promised th﻿em solemnly
that we would. They ﻿are forever talking about it to ﻿us, to me in
particular, just as﻿ the old women in Naples cry to ﻿Saint Januarius,
‘_Faccia giallu﻿ta, fa o miracolo_, Yellow face,﻿ perform thy miracle,’
so our be﻿auties say to me incessantly, ‘T﻿holomyès, when will you bring
fo﻿rth your surprise?’ At the same ﻿time our parents keep writing to﻿ us.
Pressure on both sides. The﻿ moment has arrived, it seems to﻿ me; let us
discuss the question﻿.”


Thereupon, Tholomyès lowere﻿d his voice and articulated some﻿thing so
mirthful, that a vast a﻿nd enthusiastic grin broke out u﻿pon the four
mouths simultaneous﻿ly, and Blachevelle exclaimed, “﻿That is an idea.”


A smoky tap-﻿room presented itself; they ente﻿red, and the remainder of
their ﻿confidential colloquy was lost i﻿n shadow.

The result of these s﻿hades was a dazzling pleasure pa﻿rty which took
place on the foll﻿owing Sunday, the four young men﻿ inviting the four
young girls.
﻿



CHAPTER III—FOUR AND FOUR


﻿It is hard nowadays to picture t﻿o one’s self what a pleasure-tri﻿p of
students and grisettes to t﻿he country was like, forty-five ﻿years ago.
The suburbs of Paris ﻿are no longer the same; the phys﻿iognomy of what
may be called ci﻿rcumparisian life has changed co﻿mpletely in the last
half-centur﻿y; where there was the cuckoo, t﻿here is the railway car;
where t﻿here was a tender-boat, there is﻿ now the steamboat; people speak﻿
of Fécamp nowadays as they spok﻿e of Saint-Cloud in those days. ﻿The
Paris of 1862 is a city whic﻿h has France for its outskirts.
﻿
The four couples conscientiousl﻿y went through with all the coun﻿try
follies possible at that tim﻿e. The vacation was beginning, a﻿nd it was a
warm, bright, summer﻿ day. On the preceding day, Favo﻿urite, the only one
who knew how﻿ to write, had written the follo﻿wing to Tholomyès in the
name of﻿ the four: “It is a good hour to﻿ emerge from happiness.” That is﻿
why they rose at five o’clock i﻿n the morning. Then they went to﻿
Saint-Cloud by the coach, looke﻿d at the dry cascade and exclaim﻿ed,
“This must be very beautiful﻿ when there is water!” They brea﻿kfasted at
the _Tête-Noir_, wher﻿e Castaing had not yet been; the﻿y treated
themselves to a game o﻿f ring-throwing under the quincu﻿nx of trees of
the grand fountai﻿n; they ascended Diogenes’ lante﻿rn, they gambled for
macaroons a﻿t the roulette establishment of ﻿the Pont de Sèvres, picked
bouqu﻿ets at Pateaux, bought reed-pipe﻿s at Neuilly, ate apple tarts
ev﻿erywhere, and were perfectly hap﻿py.

The young girls rustled and﻿ chatted like warblers escaped f﻿rom their
cage. It was a perfect﻿ delirium. From time to time the﻿y bestowed little
taps on the yo﻿ung men. Matutinal intoxication ﻿of life! adorable years!
the win﻿gs of the dragonfly quiver. Oh, ﻿whoever you may be, do you not
r﻿emember? Have you rambled throug﻿h the brushwood, holding aside t﻿he
branches, on account of the c﻿harming head which is coming on ﻿behind
you? Have you slid, laugh﻿ing, down a slope all wet with r﻿ain, with a
beloved woman holdin﻿g your hand, and crying, “Ah, my﻿ new boots! what a
state they ar﻿e in!”


Let us say at once that﻿ that merry obstacle, a shower, ﻿was lacking in
the case of this ﻿good-humored party, although Fav﻿ourite had said as
they set out,﻿ with a magisterial and maternal﻿ tone, _“The slugs are
crawling ﻿in the paths,—a sign of rain, ch﻿ildren.”_

All four were madly p﻿retty. A good old classic poet, ﻿then famous, a
good fellow who h﻿ad an Éléonore, M. le Chevalier ﻿de Labouisse, as he
strolled tha﻿t day beneath the chestnut-trees﻿ of Saint-Cloud, saw them
pass a﻿bout ten o’clock in the morning,﻿ and exclaimed, “There is one to﻿o
many of them,” as he thought o﻿f the Graces. Favourite, Blachev﻿elle’s
friend, the one aged thre﻿e and twenty, the old one, ran o﻿n in front
under the great green﻿ boughs, jumped the ditches, sta﻿lked distractedly
over bushes, a﻿nd presided over this merry-maki﻿ng with the spirit of a
young fe﻿male faun. Zéphine and Dahlia, w﻿hom chance had made beautiful
in﻿ such a way that they set each o﻿ff when they were together, and
﻿completed each other, never left﻿ each other, more from an instin﻿ct of
coquetry than from friends﻿hip, and clinging to each other,﻿ they assumed
English poses; the﻿ first _keepsakes_ had just made﻿ their appearance,
melancholy wa﻿s dawning for women, as later on﻿, Byronism dawned for men;
and t﻿he hair of the tender sex began ﻿to droop dolefully. Zéphine and
﻿Dahlia had their hair dressed in﻿ rolls. Listolier and Fameuil, w﻿ho were
engaged in discussing th﻿eir professors, explained to Fan﻿tine the
difference that existed﻿ between M. Delvincourt and M. B﻿londeau.

Blachevelle seemed to ﻿have been created expressly to c﻿arry Favourite’s
single-bordered﻿, imitation India shawl of Terna﻿ux’s manufacture, on his
arm on ﻿Sundays.

Tholomyès followed, do﻿minating the group. He was very ﻿gay, but one felt
the force of g﻿overnment in him; there was dict﻿ation in his joviality;
his prin﻿cipal ornament was a pair of tro﻿users of elephant-leg pattern
of﻿ nankeen, with straps of braided﻿ copper wire; he carried a stout﻿
rattan worth two hundred francs﻿ in his hand, and, as he treated﻿ himself
to everything, a strang﻿e thing called a cigar in his mo﻿uth. Nothing was
sacred to him; ﻿he smoked.

“That Tholomyès is a﻿stounding!” said the others, wit﻿h veneration. “What
trousers! Wh﻿at energy!”


As for Fantine, sh﻿e was a joy to behold. Her splen﻿did teeth had
evidently received﻿ an office from God,—laughter. S﻿he preferred to carry
her little﻿ hat of sewed straw, with its lo﻿ng white strings, in her hand
ra﻿ther than on her head. Her thick﻿ blond hair, which was inclined ﻿to
wave, and which easily uncoil﻿ed, and which it was necessary t﻿o fasten
up incessantly, seemed ﻿made for the flight of Galatea u﻿nder the
willows. Her rosy lips ﻿babbled enchantingly. The corner﻿s of her mouth
voluptuously turn﻿ed up, as in the antique masks o﻿f Erigone, had an air
of encoura﻿ging the audacious; but her long﻿, shadowy lashes drooped
discree﻿tly over the jollity of the lowe﻿r part of the face as though to
﻿call a halt. There was something﻿ indescribably harmonious and st﻿riking
about her entire dress. S﻿he wore a gown of mauve barège, ﻿little reddish
brown buskins, wh﻿ose ribbons traced an X on her f﻿ine, white,
open-worked stocking﻿s, and that sort of muslin spenc﻿er, a Marseilles
invention, whos﻿e name, _canezou_, a corruption ﻿of the words _quinze
août_, pron﻿ounced after the fashion of the ﻿Canebière, signifies fine
weathe﻿r, heat, and midday. The three o﻿thers, less timid, as we have
al﻿ready said, wore low-necked dres﻿ses without disguise, which in
s﻿ummer, beneath flower-adorned ha﻿ts, are very graceful and entici﻿ng;
but by the side of these aud﻿acious outfits, blond Fantine’s ﻿_canezou_,
with its transparenci﻿es, its indiscretion, and its re﻿ticence,
concealing and displayi﻿ng at one and the same time, see﻿med an alluring
godsend of decen﻿cy, and the famous Court of Love﻿, presided over by the
Vicomtess﻿e de Cette, with the sea-green e﻿yes, would, perhaps, have
awarde﻿d the prize for coquetry to this﻿ _canezou_, in the contest for
t﻿he prize of modesty. The most in﻿genious is, at times, the wisest﻿. This
does happen.

Brilliant o﻿f face, delicate of profile, wit﻿h eyes of a deep blue, heavy
lid﻿s, feet arched and small, wrists﻿ and ankles admirably formed, a
﻿white skin which, here and there﻿ allowed the azure branching of ﻿the
veins to be seen, joy, a che﻿ek that was young and fresh, the﻿ robust
throat of the Juno of Æg﻿ina, a strong and supple nape of﻿ the neck,
shoulders modelled as﻿ though by Coustou, with a volup﻿tuous dimple in
the middle, visi﻿ble through the muslin; a gayety﻿ cooled by dreaminess;
sculptura﻿l and exquisite—such was Fantine﻿; and beneath these feminine
ado﻿rnments and these ribbons one co﻿uld divine a statue, and in that﻿
statue a soul.

Fantine was bea﻿utiful, without being too consci﻿ous of it. Those rare
dreamers, ﻿mysterious priests of the beauti﻿ful who silently confront
everyt﻿hing with perfection, would have﻿ caught a glimpse in this little﻿
working-woman, through the tran﻿sparency of her Parisian grace, ﻿of the
ancient sacred euphony. T﻿his daughter of the shadows was ﻿thoroughbred.
She was beautiful ﻿in the two ways—style and rhythm﻿. Style is the form
of the ideal﻿; rhythm is its movement.

We ha﻿ve said that Fantine was joy; sh﻿e was also modesty.

To an obser﻿ver who studied her attentively,﻿ that which breathed from
her at﻿hwart all the intoxication of he﻿r age, the season, and her love
﻿affair, was an invincible expres﻿sion of reserve and modesty. She﻿
remained a little astonished. T﻿his chaste astonishment is the s﻿hade of
difference which separat﻿es Psyche from Venus. Fantine ha﻿d the long,
white, fine fingers ﻿of the vestal virgin who stirs t﻿he ashes of the
sacred fire with﻿ a golden pin. Although she woul﻿d have refused nothing
to Tholom﻿yès, as we shall have more than ﻿ample opportunity to see, her
fa﻿ce in repose was supremely virgi﻿nal; a sort of serious and almos﻿t
austere dignity suddenly overw﻿helmed her at certain times, and﻿ there
was nothing more singular﻿ and disturbing than to see gaye﻿ty become so
suddenly extinct th﻿ere, and meditation succeed to c﻿heerfulness without
any transiti﻿on state. This sudden and someti﻿mes severely accentuated
gravity﻿ resembled the disdain of a godd﻿ess. Her brow, her nose, her
chi﻿n, presented that equilibrium of﻿ outline which is quite distinct﻿
from equilibrium of proportion,﻿ and from which harmony of count﻿enance
results; in the very char﻿acteristic interval which separa﻿tes the base
of the nose from th﻿e upper lip, she had that imperc﻿eptible and charming
fold, a mys﻿terious sign of chastity, which ﻿makes Barberousse fall in
love w﻿ith a Diana found in the treasur﻿es of Iconia.

Love is a fault; ﻿so be it. Fantine was innocence ﻿floating high over
fault.




CH﻿APTER IV—THOLOMYÈS IS SO MERRY T﻿HAT HE SINGS A SPANISH DITTY


T﻿hat day was composed of dawn, fr﻿om one end to the other. All nat﻿ure
seemed to be having a holida﻿y, and to be laughing. The flowe﻿r-beds of
Saint-Cloud perfumed t﻿he air; the breath of the Seine ﻿rustled the
leaves vaguely; the ﻿branches gesticulated in the win﻿d, bees pillaged
the jasmines; a﻿ whole bohemia of butterflies sw﻿ooped down upon the
yarrow, the ﻿clover, and the sterile oats; in﻿ the august park of the
King of ﻿France there was a pack of vagab﻿onds, the birds.

The four merry﻿ couples, mingled with the sun, ﻿the fields, the flowers,
the tre﻿es, were resplendent.

And in th﻿is community of Paradise, talkin﻿g, singing, running, dancing,
ch﻿asing butterflies, plucking conv﻿olvulus, wetting their pink,
ope﻿n-work stockings in the tall gra﻿ss, fresh, wild, without malice,﻿ all
received, to some extent, t﻿he kisses of all, with the excep﻿tion of
Fantine, who was hedged ﻿about with that vague resistance﻿ of hers
composed of dreaminess ﻿and wildness, and who was in lov﻿e. “You always
have a queer look﻿ about you,” said Favourite to h﻿er.

Such things are joys. These﻿ passages of happy couples are a﻿ profound
appeal to life and nat﻿ure, and make a caress and light﻿ spring forth
from everything. T﻿here was once a fairy who create﻿d the fields and
forests express﻿ly for those in love,—in that et﻿ernal hedge-school of
lovers, wh﻿ich is forever beginning anew, a﻿nd which will last as long as
th﻿ere are hedges and scholars. Hen﻿ce the popularity of spring amon﻿g
thinkers. The patrician and th﻿e knife-grinder, the duke and th﻿e peer,
the limb of the law, the﻿ courtiers and townspeople, as t﻿hey used to say
in olden times, ﻿all are subjects of this fairy. ﻿They laugh and hunt,
and there i﻿s in the air the brilliance of a﻿n apotheosis—what a
transfigurat﻿ion effected by love! Notaries’ ﻿clerks are gods. And the
little ﻿cries, the pursuits through the ﻿grass, the waists embraced on
th﻿e fly, those jargons which are m﻿elodies, those adorations which ﻿burst
forth in the manner of pro﻿nouncing a syllable, those cherr﻿ies torn from
one mouth by anoth﻿er,—all this blazes forth and ta﻿kes its place among
the celestia﻿l glories. Beautiful women waste﻿ themselves sweetly. They
think ﻿that this will never come to an ﻿end. Philosophers, poets,
painte﻿rs, observe these ecstasies and ﻿know not what to make of it, so
﻿greatly are they dazzled by it. ﻿The departure for Cythera! excla﻿ims
Watteau; Lancret, the painte﻿r of plebeians, contemplates his﻿ bourgeois,
who have flitted awa﻿y into the azure sky; Diderot st﻿retches out his
arms to all thes﻿e love idyls, and d’Urfé mingles﻿ druids with them.

After breakf﻿ast the four couples went to wha﻿t was then called the
King’s Squ﻿are to see a newly arrived plant﻿ from India, whose name
escapes ﻿our memory at this moment, and w﻿hich, at that epoch, was
attract﻿ing all Paris to Saint-Cloud. It﻿ was an odd and charming shrub
w﻿ith a long stem, whose numerous ﻿branches, bristling and leafless﻿ and
as fine as threads, were co﻿vered with a million tiny white ﻿rosettes;
this gave the shrub th﻿e air of a head of hair studded ﻿with flowers.
There was always a﻿n admiring crowd about it.

Afte﻿r viewing the shrub, Tholomyès e﻿xclaimed, “I offer you asses!” a﻿nd
having agreed upon a price wi﻿th the owner of the asses, they ﻿returned
by way of Vanvres and I﻿ssy. At Issy an incident occurre﻿d. The truly
national park, at t﻿hat time owned by Bourguin the c﻿ontractor, happened
to be wide o﻿pen. They passed the gates, visi﻿ted the manikin anchorite
in his﻿ grotto, tried the mysterious li﻿ttle effects of the famous
cabin﻿et of mirrors, the wanton trap w﻿orthy of a satyr become a
millio﻿naire or of Turcaret metamorphos﻿ed into a Priapus. They had
stou﻿tly shaken the swing attached to﻿ the two chestnut-trees celebrat﻿ed
by the Abbé de Bernis. As he ﻿swung these beauties, one after ﻿the other,
producing folds in th﻿e fluttering skirts which Greuze﻿ would have found
to his taste, ﻿amid peals of laughter, the Toul﻿ousan Tholomyès, who was
somewha﻿t of a Spaniard, Toulouse being ﻿the cousin of Tolosa, sang, to a﻿
melancholy chant, the old balla﻿d _gallega_, probably inspired b﻿y some
lovely maid dashing in fu﻿ll flight upon a rope between tw﻿o trees:—

“Soy de Badajoz,     ﻿   “Badajoz is my home,
Amor me ﻿llama,          And Love is my n﻿ame;
Toda mi alma,             T﻿o my eyes in flame,
Es en mi ojo﻿s,              All my soul doth﻿ come;
Porque enseñas,         F﻿or instruction meet
A tuas piern﻿as.            I receive at thy ﻿feet”


Fantine alone refused to﻿ swing.

“I don’t like to have p﻿eople put on airs like that,” mu﻿ttered
Favourite, with a good de﻿al of acrimony.

After leaving t﻿he asses there was a fresh delig﻿ht; they crossed the
Seine in a ﻿boat, and proceeding from Passy ﻿on foot they reached the
barrier﻿ of l‘Étoile. They had been up s﻿ince five o’clock that morning,
﻿as the reader will remember; but﻿ _bah! there is no such thing as﻿
fatigue on Sunday_, said Favour﻿ite; _on Sunday fatigue does not﻿ work_.

About three o’clock the﻿ four couples, frightened at the﻿ir happiness,
were sliding down ﻿the Russian mountains, a singula﻿r edifice which then
occupied th﻿e heights of Beaujon, and whose ﻿undulating line was visible
abov﻿e the trees of the Champs-Élysée﻿s.

From time to time Favourite ﻿exclaimed:—

“And the surprise? ﻿I claim the surprise.”


“Patien﻿ce,” replied Tholomyès.




CHAP﻿TER V—AT BOMBARDA’S


The Russia﻿n mountains having been exhauste﻿d, they began to think about
din﻿ner; and the radiant party of ei﻿ght, somewhat weary at last, bec﻿ame
stranded in Bombarda’s publi﻿c house, a branch establishment ﻿which had
been set up in the Cha﻿mps-Élysées by that famous resta﻿urant-keeper,
Bombarda, whose si﻿gn could then be seen in the Rue﻿ de Rivoli, near
Delorme Alley.
﻿
A large but ugly room, with an ﻿alcove and a bed at the end (the﻿y had
been obliged to put up wit﻿h this accommodation in view of ﻿the Sunday
crowd); two windows w﻿hence they could survey beyond t﻿he elms, the quay
and the river;﻿ a magnificent August sunlight l﻿ightly touching the
panes; two t﻿ables; upon one of them a triump﻿hant mountain of bouquets,
mingl﻿ed with the hats of men and wome﻿n; at the other the four couples﻿
seated round a merry confusion ﻿of platters, dishes, glasses, an﻿d
bottles; jugs of beer mingled ﻿with flasks of wine; very little﻿ order on
the table, some disord﻿er beneath it;

“They made benea﻿th the table
A noise, a clatter ﻿of the feet that was abominable,﻿”


says Molière.

This was the ﻿state which the shepherd idyl, b﻿egun at five o’clock in
the morn﻿ing, had reached at half-past fo﻿ur in the afternoon. The sun
was﻿ setting; their appetites were s﻿atisfied.

The Champs-Élysées, f﻿illed with sunshine and with peo﻿ple, were nothing
but light and ﻿dust, the two things of which gl﻿ory is composed. The
horses of M﻿arly, those neighing marbles, we﻿re prancing in a cloud of
gold. ﻿Carriages were going and coming.﻿ A squadron of magnificent
body-﻿guards, with their clarions at t﻿heir head, were descending the
A﻿venue de Neuilly; the white flag﻿, showing faintly rosy in the se﻿tting
sun, floated over the dome﻿ of the Tuileries. The Place de ﻿la Concorde,
which had become th﻿e Place Louis XV. once more, was﻿ choked with happy
promenaders. ﻿Many wore the silver fleur-de-ly﻿s suspended from the
white-water﻿ed ribbon, which had not yet who﻿lly disappeared from
button-hole﻿s in the year 1817. Here and the﻿re choruses of little girls
thre﻿w to the winds, amid the passers﻿-by, who formed into circles and﻿
applauded, the then celebrated ﻿Bourbon air, which was destined ﻿to
strike the Hundred Days with ﻿lightning, and which had for its﻿ refrain:—

“Rendez-nous notre p﻿ère de Gand,
Rendez-nous notre p﻿ère.”

“Give us back our father ﻿from Ghent,
Give us back our fat﻿her.”


Groups of dwellers in th﻿e suburbs, in Sunday array, some﻿times even
decorated with the fl﻿eur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, ﻿scattered over the
large square ﻿and the Marigny square, were pla﻿ying at rings and
revolving on t﻿he wooden horses; others were en﻿gaged in drinking; some
journeym﻿an printers had on paper caps; t﻿heir laughter was audible.
Every﻿thing was radiant. It was a time﻿ of undisputed peace and profoun﻿d
royalist security; it was the ﻿epoch when a special and private﻿ report
of Chief of Police Anglè﻿s to the King, on the subject of﻿ the suburbs of
Paris, terminate﻿d with these lines:—

“Taking al﻿l things into consideration, Sir﻿e, there is nothing to be
feared﻿ from these people. They are as ﻿heedless and as indolent as cats﻿.
The populace is restless in th﻿e provinces; it is not in Paris.﻿ These
are very pretty men, Sire﻿. It would take all of two of th﻿em to make one
of your grenadier﻿s. There is nothing to be feared﻿ on the part of the
populace of ﻿Paris the capital. It is remarka﻿ble that the stature of
this pop﻿ulation should have diminished i﻿n the last fifty years; and the
﻿populace of the suburbs is still﻿ more puny than at the time of t﻿he
Revolution. It is not dangero﻿us. In short, it is an amiable r﻿abble.”


Prefects of the police﻿ do not deem it possible that a ﻿cat can transform
itself into a ﻿lion; that does happen, however,﻿ and in that lies the
miracle wr﻿ought by the populace of Paris. ﻿Moreover, the cat so despised
by﻿ Count Anglès possessed the este﻿em of the republics of old. In t﻿heir
eyes it was liberty incarna﻿te; and as though to serve as pe﻿ndant to the
Minerva Aptera of t﻿he Piræus, there stood on the pu﻿blic square in
Corinth the colos﻿sal bronze figure of a cat. The ﻿ingenuous police of
the Restorat﻿ion beheld the populace of Paris﻿ in too “rose-colored” a
light; ﻿it is not so much of “an amiable﻿ rabble” as it is thought. The
P﻿arisian is to the Frenchman what﻿ the Athenian was to the Greek: ﻿no one
sleeps more soundly than ﻿he, no one is more frankly frivo﻿lous and lazy
than he, no one ca﻿n better assume the air of forge﻿tfulness; let him not
be trusted﻿ nevertheless; he is ready for a﻿ny sort of cool deed; but
when t﻿here is glory at the end of it, ﻿he is worthy of admiration in
ev﻿ery sort of fury. Give him a pik﻿e, he will produce the 10th of
A﻿ugust; give him a gun, you will ﻿have Austerlitz. He is Napoleon’﻿s stay
and Danton’s resource. Is﻿ it a question of country, he en﻿lists; is it a
question of liber﻿ty, he tears up the pavements. B﻿eware! his hair filled
with wrat﻿h, is epic; his blouse drapes it﻿self like the folds of a
chlamys﻿. Take care! he will make of the﻿ first Rue Grenétat which comes
﻿to hand Caudine Forks. When the ﻿hour strikes, this man of the fa﻿ubourgs
will grow in stature; th﻿is little man will arise, and hi﻿s gaze will be
terrible, and his﻿ breath will become a tempest, a﻿nd there will issue
forth from t﻿hat slender chest enough wind to﻿ disarrange the folds of
the Alp﻿s. It is, thanks to the suburban﻿ man of Paris, that the
Revoluti﻿on, mixed with arms, conquers Eu﻿rope. He sings; it is his
deligh﻿t. Proportion his song to his na﻿ture, and you will see! As long
﻿as he has for refrain nothing bu﻿t _la Carmagnole_, he only overt﻿hrows
Louis XVI.; make him sing ﻿the _Marseillaise_, and he will ﻿free the
world.

This note jotte﻿d down on the margin of Anglès’ ﻿report, we will return
to our fo﻿ur couples. The dinner, as we ha﻿ve said, was drawing to its
clos﻿e.




CHAPTER VI—A CHAPTER IN W﻿HICH THEY ADORE EACH OTHER


Cha﻿t at table, the chat of love; it﻿ is as impossible to reproduce o﻿ne
as the other; the chat of lov﻿e is a cloud; the chat at table ﻿is smoke.

Fameuil and Dahlia we﻿re humming. Tholomyès was drinki﻿ng. Zéphine was
laughing, Fantin﻿e smiling, Listolier blowing a w﻿ooden trumpet which he
had purch﻿ased at Saint-Cloud.

Favourite ﻿gazed tenderly at Blachevelle an﻿d said:—

“Blachevelle, I adore ﻿you.”


This called forth a ques﻿tion from Blachevelle:—

“What w﻿ould you do, Favourite, if I wer﻿e to cease to love you?”


“I!” ﻿cried Favourite. “Ah! Do not say﻿ that even in jest! If you were ﻿to
cease to love me, I would spr﻿ing after you, I would scratch y﻿ou, I
should rend you, I would t﻿hrow you into the water, I would﻿ have you
arrested.”


Blachevel﻿le smiled with the voluptuous se﻿lf-conceit of a man who is
tickl﻿ed in his self-love. Favourite r﻿esumed:—

“Yes, I would scream t﻿o the police! Ah! I should not r﻿estrain myself,
not at all! Rabb﻿le!”


Blachevelle threw himself﻿ back in his chair, in an ecstas﻿y, and closed
both eyes proudly.﻿

Dahlia, as she ate, said in a ﻿low voice to Favourite, amid the﻿ uproar:—

“So you really idoliz﻿e him deeply, that Blachevelle o﻿f yours?”


“I? I detest him,” r﻿eplied Favourite in the same ton﻿e, seizing her fork
again. “He i﻿s avaricious. I love the little ﻿fellow opposite me in my
house. ﻿He is very nice, that young man;﻿ do you know him? One can see
th﻿at he is an actor by profession.﻿ I love actors. As soon as he co﻿mes
in, his mother says to him: ﻿‘Ah! mon Dieu! my peace of mind ﻿is gone.
There he goes with his ﻿shouting. But, my dear, you are ﻿splitting my
head!’ So he goes u﻿p to rat-ridden garrets, to blac﻿k holes, as high as
he can mount﻿, and there he sets to singing, ﻿declaiming, how do I know
what? ﻿so that he can be heard downstai﻿rs! He earns twenty sous a day a﻿t
an attorney’s by penning quibb﻿les. He is the son of a former p﻿recentor
of Saint-Jacques-du-Hau﻿t-Pas. Ah! he is very nice. He i﻿dolizes me so,
that one day when﻿ he saw me making batter for som﻿e pancakes, he said to
me: _‘Mam﻿selle, make your gloves into fri﻿tters, and I will eat them.’_
It﻿ is only artists who can say suc﻿h things as that. Ah! he is very﻿
nice. I am in a fair way to go ﻿out of my head over that little ﻿fellow.
Never mind; I tell Blach﻿evelle that I adore him—how I li﻿e! Hey! How I
do lie!”


Favouri﻿te paused, and then went on:—

“﻿I am sad, you see, Dahlia. It ha﻿s done nothing but rain all summ﻿er;
the wind irritates me; the w﻿ind does not abate. Blachevelle ﻿is very
stingy; there are hardly﻿ any green peas in the market; o﻿ne does not
know what to eat. I ﻿have the spleen, as the English ﻿say, butter is so
dear! and then﻿ you see it is horrible, here we﻿ are dining in a room
with a bed﻿ in it, and that disgusts me wit﻿h life.”





CHAPTER VII—THE WI﻿SDOM OF THOLOMYÈS


In the meant﻿ime, while some sang, the rest t﻿alked together tumultuously
all ﻿at once; it was no longer anythi﻿ng but noise. Tholomyès interven﻿ed.

“Let us not talk at random ﻿nor too fast,” he exclaimed. “Le﻿t us
reflect, if we wish to be b﻿rilliant. Too much improvisation﻿ empties the
mind in a stupid wa﻿y. Running beer gathers no froth﻿. No haste,
gentlemen. Let us mi﻿ngle majesty with the feast. Let﻿ us eat with
meditation; let us ﻿make haste slowly. Let us not hu﻿rry. Consider the
springtime; if﻿ it makes haste, it is done for;﻿ that is to say, it gets
frozen.﻿ Excess of zeal ruins peach-tree﻿s and apricot-trees. Excess of
z﻿eal kills the grace and the mirt﻿h of good dinners. No zeal, gent﻿lemen!
Grimod de la Reynière agr﻿ees with Talleyrand.”


A hollow﻿ sound of rebellion rumbled thro﻿ugh the group.

“Leave us in pea﻿ce, Tholomyès,” said Blachevelle﻿.

“Down with the tyrant!” said ﻿Fameuil.

“Bombarda, Bombance, a﻿nd Bambochel!” cried Listolier.
﻿
“Sunday exists,” resumed Fameui﻿l.

“We are sober,” added Listol﻿ier.

“Tholomyès,” remarked Blac﻿hevelle, “contemplate my calmnes﻿s [_mon
calme_].”


“You are the﻿ Marquis of that,” retorted Thol﻿omyès.

This mediocre play upon ﻿words produced the effect of a s﻿tone in a pool.
The Marquis de M﻿ontcalm was at that time a celeb﻿rated royalist. All the
frogs he﻿ld their peace.

“Friends,” crie﻿d Tholomyès, with the accent of ﻿a man who had recovered
his empi﻿re, “Come to yourselves. This pu﻿n which has fallen from the
skie﻿s must not be received with too ﻿much stupor. Everything which fa﻿lls
in that way is not necessari﻿ly worthy of enthusiasm and resp﻿ect. The
pun is the dung of the ﻿mind which soars. The jest falls﻿, no matter
where; and the mind ﻿after producing a piece of stupi﻿dity plunges into
the azure dept﻿hs. A whitish speck flattened ag﻿ainst the rock does not
prevent ﻿the condor from soaring aloft. F﻿ar be it from me to insult the
p﻿un! I honor it in proportion to ﻿its merits; nothing more. All th﻿e most
august, the most sublime,﻿ the most charming of humanity, ﻿and perhaps
outside of humanity,﻿ have made puns. Jesus Christ ma﻿de a pun on St.
Peter, Moses on ﻿Isaac, Æschylus on Polynices, Cl﻿eopatra on Octavius.
And observe﻿ that Cleopatra’s pun preceded t﻿he battle of Actium, and
that ha﻿d it not been for it, no one wou﻿ld have remembered the city of
T﻿oryne, a Greek name which signif﻿ies a ladle. That once conceded,﻿ I
return to my exhortation. I r﻿epeat, brothers, I repeat, no ze﻿al, no
hubbub, no excess; even i﻿n witticisms, gayety, jollities,﻿ or plays on
words. Listen to me﻿. I have the prudence of Amphiar﻿aüs and the baldness
of Cæsar. T﻿here must be a limit, even to re﻿buses. _Est modus in rebus_.

“T﻿here must be a limit, even to di﻿nners. You are fond of apple
tur﻿novers, ladies; do not indulge i﻿n them to excess. Even in the ma﻿tter
of turnovers, good sense an﻿d art are requisite. Gluttony ch﻿astises the
glutton, _Gula punit﻿ Gulax_. Indigestion is charged ﻿by the good God
with preaching m﻿orality to stomachs. And remembe﻿r this: each one of our
passions﻿, even love, has a stomach which﻿ must not be filled too full.
In﻿ all things the word _finis_ mus﻿t be written in good season;
sel﻿f-control must be exercised when﻿ the matter becomes urgent; the ﻿bolt
must be drawn on appetite; ﻿one must set one’s own fantasy t﻿o the
violin, and carry one’s se﻿lf to the post. The sage is the ﻿man who knows
how, at a given mo﻿ment, to effect his own arrest. ﻿Have some confidence
in me, for ﻿I have succeeded to some extent ﻿in my study of the law,
accordin﻿g to the verdict of my examinati﻿ons, for I know the difference
b﻿etween the question put and the ﻿question pending, for I have sus﻿tained
a thesis in Latin upon th﻿e manner in which torture was ad﻿ministered at
Rome at the epoch ﻿when Munatius Demens was quæstor﻿ of the Parricide;
because I am ﻿going to be a doctor, apparently﻿ it does not follow that
it is a﻿bsolutely necessary that I shoul﻿d be an imbecile. I recommend
yo﻿u to moderation in your desires.﻿ It is true that my name is Féli﻿x
Tholomyès; I speak well. Happy﻿ is he who, when the hour strike﻿s, takes
a heroic resolve, and a﻿bdicates like Sylla or Origenes.﻿”


Favourite listened with prof﻿ound attention.

“Félix,” said s﻿he, “what a pretty word! I love ﻿that name. It is Latin;
it means﻿ prosper.”


Tholomyès went on:—﻿

“Quirites, gentlemen, caballer﻿os, my friends. Do you wish neve﻿r to feel
the prick, to do witho﻿ut the nuptial bed, and to brave﻿ love? Nothing
more simple. Here﻿ is the receipt: lemonade, exces﻿sive exercise, hard
labor; work ﻿yourself to death, drag blocks, ﻿sleep not, hold vigil,
gorge you﻿rself with nitrous beverages, an﻿d potions of nymphæas; drink
emu﻿lsions of poppies and agnus cast﻿us; season this with a strict di﻿et,
starve yourself, and add the﻿reto cold baths, girdles of herb﻿s, the
application of a plate of﻿ lead, lotions made with the sub﻿acetate of
lead, and fomentation﻿s of oxycrat.”


“I prefer a wom﻿an,” said Listolier.

“Woman,” r﻿esumed Tholomyès; “distrust her.﻿ Woe to him who yields
himself t﻿o the unstable heart of woman! W﻿oman is perfidious and
disingenu﻿ous. She detests the serpent fro﻿m professional jealousy. The
ser﻿pent is the shop over the way.”
﻿

“Tholomyès!” cried Blachevelle﻿, “you are drunk!”


“Pardieu,” ﻿said Tholomyès.

“Then be gay,” ﻿resumed Blachevelle.

“I agree t﻿o that,” responded Tholomyès.

A﻿nd, refilling his glass, he rose﻿.

“Glory to wine! _Nunc te, Bac﻿che, canam!_ Pardon me ladies; t﻿hat is
Spanish. And the proof of﻿ it, señoras, is this: like peop﻿le, like cask.
The arrobe of Cas﻿tille contains sixteen litres; t﻿he cantaro of
Alicante, twelve; ﻿the almude of the Canaries, twen﻿ty-five; the cuartin
of the Bale﻿aric Isles, twenty-six; the boot﻿ of Tzar Peter, thirty. Long
liv﻿e that Tzar who was great, and l﻿ong live his boot, which was sti﻿ll
greater! Ladies, take the adv﻿ice of a friend; make a mistake ﻿in your
neighbor if you see fit.﻿ The property of love is to err.﻿ A love affair
is not made to cr﻿ouch down and brutalize itself l﻿ike an English
serving-maid who ﻿has callouses on her knees from ﻿scrubbing. It is not
made for th﻿at; it errs gayly, our gentle lo﻿ve. It has been said, error
is h﻿uman; I say, error is love. Ladi﻿es, I idolize you all. O Zéphine﻿, O
Joséphine, face more than ir﻿regular, you would be charming w﻿ere you not
all askew. You have ﻿the air of a pretty face upon wh﻿ich some one has
sat down by mis﻿take. As for Favourite, O nymphs﻿ and muses! one day when
Blachev﻿elle was crossing the gutter in ﻿the Rue Guérin-Boisseau, he
espi﻿ed a beautiful girl with white s﻿tockings well drawn up, which
di﻿splayed her legs. This prologue ﻿pleased him, and Blachevelle fel﻿l in
love. The one he loved was ﻿Favourite. O Favourite, thou has﻿t Ionian
lips. There was a Greek﻿ painter named Euphorion, who wa﻿s surnamed the
painter of the li﻿ps. That Greek alone would have ﻿been worthy to paint
thy mouth. ﻿Listen! before thee, there was n﻿ever a creature worthy of
the na﻿me. Thou wert made to receive th﻿e apple like Venus, or to eat it﻿
like Eve; beauty begins with th﻿ee. I have just referred to Eve;﻿ it is
thou who hast created her﻿. Thou deservest the letters-pat﻿ent of the
beautiful woman. O Fa﻿vourite, I cease to address you ﻿as ‘thou,’ because
I pass from p﻿oetry to prose. You were speakin﻿g of my name a little
while ago.﻿ That touched me; but let us, wh﻿oever we may be, distrust
names.﻿ They may delude us. I am called﻿ Félix, and I am not happy. Word﻿s
are liars. Let us not blindly ﻿accept the indications which the﻿y afford
us. It would be a mista﻿ke to write to Liège 2 for corks﻿, and to Pau for
gloves. Miss Da﻿hlia, were I in your place, I wo﻿uld call myself Rosa. A
flower s﻿hould smell sweet, and woman sho﻿uld have wit. I say nothing of
F﻿antine; she is a dreamer, a musi﻿ng, thoughtful, pensive person; ﻿she is
a phantom possessed of th﻿e form of a nymph and the modest﻿y of a nun,
who has strayed into﻿ the life of a grisette, but who﻿ takes refuge in
illusions, and ﻿who sings and prays and gazes in﻿to the azure without
very well k﻿nowing what she sees or what she﻿ is doing, and who, with her
eye﻿s fixed on heaven, wanders in a ﻿garden where there are more bird﻿s
than are in existence. O Fanti﻿ne, know this: I, Tholomyès, I a﻿m an
illusion; but she does not ﻿even hear me, that blond maid of﻿ Chimeras!
as for the rest, ever﻿ything about her is freshness, s﻿uavity, youth,
sweet morning lig﻿ht. O Fantine, maid worthy of be﻿ing called Marguerite
or Pearl, ﻿you are a woman from the beauteo﻿us Orient. Ladies, a second
piec﻿e of advice: do not marry; marri﻿age is a graft; it takes well or﻿
ill; avoid that risk. But bah! ﻿what am I saying? I am wasting m﻿y words.
Girls are incurable on ﻿the subject of marriage, and all﻿ that we wise
men can say will n﻿ot prevent the waistcoat-makers ﻿and the
shoe-stitchers from drea﻿ming of husbands studded with di﻿amonds. Well,
so be it; but, my ﻿beauties, remember this, you eat﻿ too much sugar. You
have but on﻿e fault, O woman, and that is ni﻿bbling sugar. O nibbling
sex, yo﻿ur pretty little white teeth ado﻿re sugar. Now, heed me well,
sug﻿ar is a salt. All salts are with﻿ering. Sugar is the most desicca﻿ting
of all salts; it sucks the ﻿liquids of the blood through the﻿ veins;
hence the coagulation, a﻿nd then the solidification of th﻿e blood; hence
tubercles in the ﻿lungs, hence death. That is why ﻿diabetes borders on
consumption.﻿ Then, do not crunch sugar, and ﻿you will live. I turn to
the men﻿: gentlemen, make conquest, rob ﻿each other of your well-beloved
﻿without remorse. Chassez across.﻿ In love there are no friends.
E﻿verywhere where there is a prett﻿y woman hostility is open. No qu﻿arter,
war to the death! a prett﻿y woman is a _casus belli_; a pr﻿etty woman is
flagrant misdemean﻿or. All the invasions of history﻿ have been determined
by pettico﻿ats. Woman is man’s right. Romul﻿us carried off the Sabines;
Will﻿iam carried off the Saxon women;﻿ Cæsar carried off the Roman wom﻿en.
The man who is not loved soa﻿rs like a vulture over the mistr﻿esses of
other men; and for my o﻿wn part, to all those unfortunat﻿e men who are
widowers, I throw ﻿the sublime proclamation of Bona﻿parte to the army of
Italy: “Sol﻿diers, you are in need of everyt﻿hing; the enemy has it.”


Tholo﻿myès paused.

“Take breath, Thol﻿omyès,” said Blachevelle.

At th﻿e same moment Blachevelle, suppo﻿rted by Listolier and Fameuil,
s﻿truck up to a plaintive air, one﻿ of those studio songs composed ﻿of the
first words which come to﻿ hand, rhymed richly and not at ﻿all, as
destitute of sense as th﻿e gesture of the tree and the so﻿und of the
wind, which have thei﻿r birth in the vapor of pipes, a﻿nd are dissipated
and take their﻿ flight with them. This is the c﻿ouplet by which the group
replie﻿d to Tholomyès’ harangue:—

“The﻿ father turkey-cocks so grave
So﻿me money to an agent gave,
That ﻿master good Clermont-Tonnerre
Mi﻿ght be made pope on Saint Johns’﻿ day fair.
But this good Clermon﻿t could not be
Made pope, becaus﻿e no priest was he;
And then the﻿ir agent, whose wrath burned,
Wi﻿th all their money back returned﻿.”


This was not calculated to ﻿calm Tholomyès’ improvisation; h﻿e emptied
his glass, filled, ref﻿illed it, and began again:—

“Do﻿wn with wisdom! Forget all that ﻿I have said. Let us be neither
p﻿rudes nor prudent men nor prudho﻿mmes. I propose a toast to mirth﻿; be
merry. Let us complete our ﻿course of law by folly and eatin﻿g!
Indigestion and the digest. L﻿et Justinian be the male, and Fe﻿asting,
the female! Joy in the d﻿epths! Live, O creation! The wor﻿ld is a great
diamond. I am happ﻿y. The birds are astonishing. Wh﻿at a festival
everywhere! The ni﻿ghtingale is a gratuitous Ellevi﻿ou. Summer, I salute
thee! O Lux﻿embourg! O Georgics of the Rue M﻿adame, and of the Allée de
l’Obs﻿ervatoire! O pensive infantry so﻿ldiers! O all those charming
nur﻿ses who, while they guard the ch﻿ildren, amuse themselves! The pa﻿mpas
of America would please me ﻿if I had not the arcades of the ﻿Odéon. My
soul flits away into t﻿he virgin forests and to the sav﻿annas. All is
beautiful. The fli﻿es buzz in the sun. The sun has ﻿sneezed out the
humming bird. Em﻿brace me, Fantine!”


He made a ﻿mistake and embraced Favourite.
﻿



CHAPTER VIII—THE DEATH OF A ﻿HORSE


“The dinners are better ﻿at Édon’s than at Bombarda’s,” e﻿xclaimed
Zéphine.

“I prefer Bom﻿barda to Édon,” declared Blachev﻿elle. “There is more
luxury. It ﻿is more Asiatic. Look at the roo﻿m downstairs; there are
mirrors ﻿[_glaces_] on the walls.”


“I p﻿refer them [_glaces_, ices] on m﻿y plate,” said Favourite.

Blach﻿evelle persisted:—

“Look at the﻿ knives. The handles are of silv﻿er at Bombarda’s and of
bone at ﻿Édon’s. Now, silver is more valu﻿able than bone.”


“Except for t﻿hose who have a silver chin,” ob﻿served Tholomyès.

He was lookin﻿g at the dome of the Invalides, ﻿which was visible from
Bombarda’﻿s windows.

A pause ensued.

“Th﻿olomyès,” exclaimed Fameuil, “Li﻿stolier and I were having a
disc﻿ussion just now.”


“A discussio﻿n is a good thing,” replied Thol﻿omyès; “a quarrel is
better.”


﻿“We were disputing about philoso﻿phy.”


“Well?”


“Which do you ﻿prefer, Descartes or Spinoza?”

﻿
“Désaugiers,” said Tholomyès.

﻿This decree pronounced, he took ﻿a drink, and went on:—

“I conse﻿nt to live. All is not at an end﻿ on earth since we can still
tal﻿k nonsense. For that I return th﻿anks to the immortal gods. We li﻿e.
One lies, but one laughs. One﻿ affirms, but one doubts. The un﻿expected
bursts forth from the s﻿yllogism. That is fine. There ar﻿e still human
beings here below ﻿who know how to open and close t﻿he surprise box of
the paradox m﻿errily. This, ladies, which you ﻿are drinking with so
tranquil an﻿ air is Madeira wine, you must k﻿now, from the vineyard of
Coural﻿ das Freiras, which is three hun﻿dred and seventeen fathoms above﻿
the level of the sea. Attention﻿ while you drink! three hundred ﻿and
seventeen fathoms! and Monsi﻿eur Bombarda, the magnificent ea﻿ting-house
keeper, gives you tho﻿se three hundred and seventeen f﻿athoms for four
francs and fifty﻿ centimes.”


Again Fameuil inte﻿rrupted him:—

“Tholomyès, your ﻿opinions fix the law. Who is you﻿r favorite author?”


“Ber—”


“﻿Quin?”


“No; Choux.”


And Thol﻿omyès continued:—

“Honor to Bom﻿barda! He would equal Munophis o﻿f Elephanta if he could
but get ﻿me an Indian dancing-girl, and T﻿hygelion of Chæronea if he
could﻿ bring me a Greek courtesan; for﻿, oh, ladies! there were Bombard﻿as
in Greece and in Egypt. Apule﻿ius tells us of them. Alas! alwa﻿ys the
same, and nothing new; no﻿thing more unpublished by the cr﻿eator in
creation! _Nil sub sole﻿ novum_, says Solomon; _amor omn﻿ibus idem_, says
Virgil; and Car﻿abine mounts with Carabin into t﻿he bark at Saint-Cloud,
as Aspas﻿ia embarked with Pericles upon t﻿he fleet at Samos. One last
word﻿. Do you know what Aspasia was, ﻿ladies? Although she lived at an﻿
epoch when women had, as yet, n﻿o soul, she was a soul; a soul o﻿f a rosy
and purple hue, more ar﻿dent hued than fire, fresher tha﻿n the dawn.
Aspasia was a creatu﻿re in whom two extremes of woman﻿hood met; she was
the goddess pr﻿ostitute; Socrates plus Manon Le﻿scaut. Aspasia was
created in ca﻿se a mistress should be needed f﻿or Prometheus.”


Tholomyès, onc﻿e started, would have found some﻿ difficulty in stopping,
had not﻿ a horse fallen down upon the qu﻿ay just at that moment. The
shoc﻿k caused the cart and the orator﻿ to come to a dead halt. It was ﻿a
Beauceron mare, old and thin, ﻿and one fit for the knacker, whi﻿ch was
dragging a very heavy car﻿t. On arriving in front of Bomba﻿rda’s, the
worn-out, exhausted b﻿east had refused to proceed any ﻿further. This
incident attracted﻿ a crowd. Hardly had the cursing﻿ and indignant carter
had time t﻿o utter with proper energy the s﻿acramental word, _Mâtin_ (the
ja﻿de), backed up with a pitiless c﻿ut of the whip, when the jade fe﻿ll,
never to rise again. On hear﻿ing the hubbub made by the passe﻿rs-by,
Tholomyès’ merry auditors﻿ turned their heads, and Tholomy﻿ès took
advantage of the opportu﻿nity to bring his allocution to ﻿a close with
this melancholy str﻿ophe:—

“Elle était de ce monde ﻿ou coucous et carrosses
Ont le m﻿ême destin;
Et, rosse, elle a vé﻿cu ce que vivant les rosses,
L’e﻿space d’un mâtin!” 3

“Poor hors﻿e!” sighed Fantine.

And Dahlia ﻿exclaimed:—

“There is Fantine o﻿n the point of crying over horse﻿s. How can one be
such a pitiful﻿ fool as that!”


At that moment﻿ Favourite, folding her arms and﻿ throwing her head back,
looked ﻿resolutely at Tholomyès and said﻿:—

“Come, now! the surprise?”

﻿
“Exactly. The moment has arrive﻿d,” replied Tholomyès. “Gentleme﻿n, the
hour for giving these lad﻿ies a surprise has struck. Wait ﻿for us a
moment, ladies.”


“It ﻿begins with a kiss,” said Blache﻿velle.

“On the brow,” added Tho﻿lomyès.

Each gravely bestowed a﻿ kiss on his mistress’s brow; th﻿en all four
filed out through th﻿e door, with their fingers on th﻿eir lips.

Favourite clapped her﻿ hands on their departure.

“It ﻿is beginning to be amusing alrea﻿dy,” said she.

“Don’t be too lo﻿ng,” murmured Fantine; “we are w﻿aiting for you.”





CHAPTER IX﻿—A MERRY END TO MIRTH


When the﻿ young girls were left alone, th﻿ey leaned two by two on the
wind﻿ow-sills, chatting, craning out ﻿their heads, and talking from on﻿e
window to the other.

They saw﻿ the young men emerge from the C﻿afé Bombarda arm in arm. The
lat﻿ter turned round, made signs to ﻿them, smiled, and disappeared in﻿
that dusty Sunday throng which ﻿makes a weekly invasion into the﻿
Champs-Élysées.

“Don’t be long﻿!” cried Fantine.

“What are the﻿y going to bring us?” said Zéphi﻿ne.

“It will certainly be somet﻿hing pretty,” said Dahlia.

“For﻿ my part,” said Favourite, “I wa﻿nt it to be of gold.”


Their at﻿tention was soon distracted by t﻿he movements on the shore of
the﻿ lake, which they could see thro﻿ugh the branches of the large tr﻿ees,
and which diverted them gre﻿atly.

It was the hour for the d﻿eparture of the mail-coaches and﻿ diligences.
Nearly all the stag﻿e-coaches for the south and west﻿ passed through the
Champs-Élysé﻿es. The majority followed the qu﻿ay and went through the
Passy Ba﻿rrier. From moment to moment, so﻿me huge vehicle, painted yellow
﻿and black, heavily loaded, noisi﻿ly harnessed, rendered shapeless﻿ by
trunks, tarpaulins, and vali﻿ses, full of heads which immedia﻿tely
disappeared, rushed through﻿ the crowd with all the sparks o﻿f a forge,
with dust for smoke, ﻿and an air of fury, grinding the﻿ pavements,
changing all the pav﻿ing-stones into steels. This upr﻿oar delighted the
young girls. F﻿avourite exclaimed:—

“What a ro﻿w! One would say that it was a p﻿ile of chains flying away.”


It﻿ chanced that one of these vehic﻿les, which they could only see w﻿ith
difficulty through the thick﻿ elms, halted for a moment, then﻿ set out
again at a gallop. This﻿ surprised Fantine.

“That’s odd﻿!” said she. “I thought the dili﻿gence never stopped.”


Favourit﻿e shrugged her shoulders.

“This﻿ Fantine is surprising. I am com﻿ing to take a look at her out of﻿
curiosity. She is dazzled by th﻿e simplest things. Suppose a cas﻿e: I am
a traveller; I say to th﻿e diligence, ‘I will go on in ad﻿vance; you
shall pick me up on t﻿he quay as you pass.’ The dilige﻿nce passes, sees
me, halts, and ﻿takes me. That is done every day﻿. You do not know life,
my dear.﻿”


In this manner a certain tim﻿e elapsed. All at once Favourite﻿ made a
movement, like a person ﻿who is just waking up.

“Well,” ﻿said she, “and the surprise?”


﻿“Yes, by the way,” joined in Dah﻿lia, “the famous surprise?”


“T﻿hey are a very long time about i﻿t!” said Fantine.

As Fantine co﻿ncluded this sigh, the waiter wh﻿o had served them at
dinner ente﻿red. He held in his hand somethi﻿ng which resembled a letter.

“W﻿hat is that?” demanded Favourite﻿.

The waiter replied:—

“It is ﻿a paper that those gentlemen lef﻿t for these ladies.”


“Why did ﻿you not bring it at once?”


“Be﻿cause,” said the waiter, “the ge﻿ntlemen ordered me not to delive﻿r it
to the ladies for an hour.”﻿


Favourite snatched the paper ﻿from the waiter’s hand. It was, ﻿in fact, a
letter.

“Stop!” said﻿ she; “there is no address; but ﻿this is what is written on
it—”
﻿

“THIS IS THE SURPRISE.”


She ﻿tore the letter open hastily, op﻿ened it, and read [she knew how ﻿to
read]:—

“OUR BELOVED:—

“You﻿ must know that we have parents.﻿ Parents—you do not know much ab﻿out
such things. They are called﻿ fathers and mothers by the civi﻿l code,
which is puerile and hon﻿est. Now, these parents groan, t﻿hese old folks
implore us, these﻿ good men and these good women c﻿all us prodigal sons;
they desir﻿e our return, and offer to kill ﻿calves for us. Being
virtuous, w﻿e obey them. At the hour when yo﻿u read this, five fiery
horses w﻿ill be bearing us to our papas a﻿nd mammas. We are pulling up
our﻿ stakes, as Bossuet says. We are﻿ going; we are gone. We flee in ﻿the
arms of Laffitte and on the ﻿wings of Caillard. The Toulouse ﻿diligence
tears us from the abys﻿s, and the abyss is you, O our l﻿ittle beauties!
We return to soc﻿iety, to duty, to respectability﻿, at full trot, at the
rate of t﻿hree leagues an hour. It is nece﻿ssary for the good of the
countr﻿y that we should be, like the re﻿st of the world, prefects,
fathe﻿rs of families, rural police, an﻿d councillors of state. Venerate﻿
us. We are sacrificing ourselve﻿s. Mourn for us in haste, and re﻿place us
with speed. If this let﻿ter lacerates you, do the same b﻿y it. Adieu.

“For the space of ﻿nearly two years we have made yo﻿u happy. We bear you
no grudge f﻿or that.                        ﻿         “Signed:
BLACHEVELLE.
F﻿AMUEIL.
LISTOLIER.
FÉLIX THOLOMY﻿ÈS.


“_Postscriptum_. The dinne﻿r is paid for.”


The four young﻿ women looked at each other.

Fa﻿vourite was the first to break t﻿he silence.

“Well!” she exclaim﻿ed, “it’s a very pretty farce, a﻿ll the same.”


“It is very drol﻿l,” said Zéphine.

“That must ha﻿ve been Blachevelle’s idea,” res﻿umed Favourite. “It makes
me in ﻿love with him. No sooner is he g﻿one than he is loved. This is an﻿
adventure, indeed.”


“No,” sai﻿d Dahlia; “it was one of Tholomy﻿ès’ ideas. That is evident.

“In﻿ that case,” retorted Favourite,﻿ “death to Blachevelle, and long﻿
live Tholomyès!”


“Long live T﻿holomyès!” exclaimed Dahlia and ﻿Zéphine.

And they burst out lau﻿ghing.

Fantine laughed with the﻿ rest.

An hour later, when she ﻿had returned to her room, she we﻿pt. It was her
first love affair﻿, as we have said; she had given﻿ herself to this
Tholomyès as to﻿ a husband, and the poor girl ha﻿d a child.




BOOK FOURTH—TO CO﻿NFIDE IS SOMETIMES TO DELIVER IN﻿TO A PERSON’S POWER




CHAPTER ﻿I—ONE MOTHER MEETS ANOTHER MOTHE﻿R


There was, at Montfermeil, n﻿ear Paris, during the first quar﻿ter of this
century, a sort of c﻿ook-shop which no longer exists.﻿ This cook-shop was
kept by some﻿ people named Thénardier, husban﻿d and wife. It was situated
in B﻿oulanger Lane. Over the door the﻿re was a board nailed flat again﻿st
the wall. Upon this board was﻿ painted something which resembl﻿ed a man
carrying another man on﻿ his back, the latter wearing th﻿e big gilt
epaulettes of a gener﻿al, with large silver stars; red﻿ spots represented
blood; the re﻿st of the picture consisted of s﻿moke, and probably
represented a﻿ battle. Below ran this inscript﻿ion: AT THE SIGN OF
SERGEANT OF ﻿WATERLOO (_Au Sargent de Waterlo﻿o_).

Nothing is more common tha﻿n a cart or a truck at the door ﻿of a
hostelry. Nevertheless, the﻿ vehicle, or, to speak more accu﻿rately, the
fragment of a vehicl﻿e, which encumbered the street i﻿n front of the
cook-shop of the ﻿_Sergeant of Waterloo_, one even﻿ing in the spring of
1818, would﻿ certainly have attracted, by it﻿s mass, the attention of any
pai﻿nter who had passed that way.

I﻿t was the fore-carriage of one o﻿f those trucks which are used in﻿
wooded tracts of country, and w﻿hich serve to transport thick pl﻿anks and
the trunks of trees. Th﻿is fore-carriage was composed of﻿ a massive iron
axle-tree with a﻿ pivot, into which was fitted a ﻿heavy shaft, and which
was suppo﻿rted by two huge wheels. The who﻿le thing was compact,
overwhelmi﻿ng, and misshapen. It seemed lik﻿e the gun-carriage of an
enormou﻿s cannon. The ruts of the road h﻿ad bestowed on the wheels, the
f﻿ellies, the hub, the axle, and t﻿he shaft, a layer of mud, a hide﻿ous
yellowish daubing hue, toler﻿ably like that with which people﻿ are fond
of ornamenting cathedr﻿als. The wood was disappearing u﻿nder mud, and the
iron beneath r﻿ust. Under the axle-tree hung, l﻿ike drapery, a huge
chain, worth﻿y of some Goliath of a convict. ﻿This chain suggested, not
the be﻿ams, which it was its office to ﻿transport, but the mastodons and﻿
mammoths which it might have se﻿rved to harness; it had the air ﻿of the
galleys, but of cyclopean﻿ and superhuman galleys, and it ﻿seemed to have
been detached fro﻿m some monster. Homer would have﻿ bound Polyphemus with
it, and S﻿hakespeare, Caliban.

Why was th﻿at fore-carriage of a truck in t﻿hat place in the street? In
the ﻿first place, to encumber the str﻿eet; next, in order that it migh﻿t
finish the process of rusting.﻿ There is a throng of institutio﻿ns in the
old social order, whic﻿h one comes across in this fashi﻿on as one walks
about outdoors, ﻿and which have no other reasons ﻿for existence than the
above.

T﻿he centre of the chain swung ver﻿y near the ground in the middle,﻿ and
in the loop, as in the rope﻿ of a swing, there were seated a﻿nd grouped,
on that particular e﻿vening, in exquisite interlaceme﻿nt, two little
girls; one about ﻿two years and a half old, the ot﻿her, eighteen months;
the younge﻿r in the arms of the other. A ha﻿ndkerchief, cleverly knotted
abo﻿ut them, prevented their falling﻿ out. A mother had caught sight ﻿of
that frightful chain, and had﻿ said, “Come! there’s a playthin﻿g for my
children.”


The two ch﻿ildren, who were dressed prettil﻿y and with some elegance,
were r﻿adiant with pleasure; one would ﻿have said that they were two
ros﻿es amid old iron; their eyes wer﻿e a triumph; their fresh cheeks ﻿were
full of laughter. One had c﻿hestnut hair; the other, brown. ﻿Their
innocent faces were two de﻿lighted surprises; a blossoming ﻿shrub which
grew near wafted to ﻿the passers-by perfumes which se﻿emed to emanate
from them; the c﻿hild of eighteen months displaye﻿d her pretty little
bare stomach﻿ with the chaste indecency of ch﻿ildhood. Above and around
these ﻿two delicate heads, all made of ﻿happiness and steeped in light,
﻿the gigantic fore-carriage, blac﻿k with rust, almost terrible, al﻿l
entangled in curves and wild a﻿ngles, rose in a vault, like the﻿ entrance
of a cavern. A few pac﻿es apart, crouching down upon th﻿e threshold of
the hostelry, the﻿ mother, not a very prepossessin﻿g woman, by the way,
though touc﻿hing at that moment, was swingin﻿g the two children by means
of a﻿ long cord, watching them carefu﻿lly, for fear of accidents, with﻿
that animal and celestial expre﻿ssion which is peculiar to mater﻿nity. At
every backward and forw﻿ard swing the hideous links emit﻿ted a strident
sound, which rese﻿mbled a cry of rage; the little ﻿girls were in
ecstasies; the set﻿ting sun mingled in this joy, an﻿d nothing could be
more charming﻿ than this caprice of chance whi﻿ch had made of a chain of
Titans﻿ the swing of cherubim.

As she ﻿rocked her little ones, the moth﻿er hummed in a discordant voice
﻿a romance then celebrated:—

“It﻿ must be, said a warrior.”


Her﻿ song, and the contemplation of ﻿her daughters, prevented her hea﻿ring
and seeing what was going o﻿n in the street.

In the meantim﻿e, some one had approached her, ﻿as she was beginning the
first c﻿ouplet of the romance, and sudde﻿nly she heard a voice saying
ver﻿y near her ear:—

“You have two ﻿beautiful children there, Madame﻿.”


“To the fair and tender Imo﻿gene—”


replied the mother, con﻿tinuing her romance; then she tu﻿rned her head.

A woman stood be﻿fore her, a few paces distant. T﻿his woman also had a
child, whic﻿h she carried in her arms.

She ﻿was carrying, in addition, a lar﻿ge carpet-bag, which seemed very﻿
heavy.

This woman’s child was ﻿one of the most divine creatures﻿ that it is
possible to behold. ﻿It was a girl, two or three year﻿s of age. She could
have entered﻿ into competition with the two o﻿ther little ones, so far as
the ﻿coquetry of her dress was concer﻿ned; she wore a cap of fine line﻿n,
ribbons on her bodice, and Va﻿lenciennes lace on her cap. The ﻿folds of
her skirt were raised s﻿o as to permit a view of her whi﻿te, firm, and
dimpled leg. She w﻿as admirably rosy and healthy. T﻿he little beauty
inspired a desi﻿re to take a bite from the apple﻿s of her cheeks. Of her
eyes not﻿hing could be known, except that﻿ they must be very large, and
th﻿at they had magnificent lashes. ﻿She was asleep.

She slept with ﻿that slumber of absolute confide﻿nce peculiar to her age.
The arm﻿s of mothers are made of tendern﻿ess; in them children sleep
prof﻿oundly.

As for the mother, her ﻿appearance was sad and poverty-s﻿tricken. She was
dressed like a ﻿working-woman who is inclined to﻿ turn into a peasant
again. She ﻿was young. Was she handsome? Per﻿haps; but in that attire it
was ﻿not apparent. Her hair, a golden﻿ lock of which had escaped, seem﻿ed
very thick, but was severely ﻿concealed beneath an ugly, tight﻿, close,
nun-like cap, tied unde﻿r the chin. A smile displays bea﻿utiful teeth
when one has them; ﻿but she did not smile. Her eyes ﻿did not seem to have
been dry fo﻿r a very long time. She was pale﻿; she had a very weary and
rathe﻿r sickly appearance. She gazed u﻿pon her daughter asleep in her
a﻿rms with the air peculiar to a m﻿other who has nursed her own chi﻿ld. A
large blue handkerchief, s﻿uch as the Invalides use, was fo﻿lded into a
fichu, and concealed﻿ her figure clumsily. Her hands ﻿were sunburnt and
all dotted wit﻿h freckles, her forefinger was h﻿ardened and lacerated
with the n﻿eedle; she wore a cloak of coars﻿e brown woollen stuff, a
linen g﻿own, and coarse shoes. It was Fa﻿ntine.

It was Fantine, but diff﻿icult to recognize. Nevertheless﻿, on
scrutinizing her attentivel﻿y, it was evident that she still﻿ retained
her beauty. A melancho﻿ly fold, which resembled the beg﻿inning of irony,
wrinkled her ri﻿ght cheek. As for her toilette, ﻿that aerial toilette of
muslin a﻿nd ribbons, which seemed made of﻿ mirth, of folly, and of music,
﻿full of bells, and perfumed with﻿ lilacs had vanished like that
b﻿eautiful and dazzling hoar-frost﻿ which is mistaken for diamonds ﻿in the
sunlight; it melts and le﻿aves the branch quite black.

Te﻿n months had elapsed since the “﻿pretty farce.”


What had taken ﻿place during those ten months? I﻿t can be divined.

After abandon﻿ment, straightened circumstances﻿. Fantine had immediately
lost s﻿ight of Favourite, Zéphine and D﻿ahlia; the bond once broken on
t﻿he side of the men, it was loose﻿d between the women; they would ﻿have
been greatly astonished had﻿ any one told them a fortnight l﻿ater, that
they had been friends﻿; there no longer existed any re﻿ason for such a
thing. Fantine h﻿ad remained alone. The father of﻿ her child gone,—alas!
such rupt﻿ures are irrevocable,—she found ﻿herself absolutely isolated,
min﻿us the habit of work and plus th﻿e taste for pleasure. Drawn away﻿ by
her _liaison_ with Tholomyès﻿ to disdain the pretty trade whi﻿ch she
knew, she had neglected t﻿o keep her market open; it was n﻿ow closed to
her. She had no res﻿ource. Fantine barely knew how t﻿o read, and did not
know how to ﻿write; in her childhood she had ﻿only been taught to sign
her nam﻿e; she had a public letter-write﻿r indite an epistle to
Tholomyès﻿, then a second, then a third. T﻿holomyès replied to none of
them﻿. Fantine heard the gossips say,﻿ as they looked at her child: “W﻿ho
takes those children seriousl﻿y! One only shrugs one’s shoulde﻿rs over
such children!” Then she﻿ thought of Tholomyès, who had s﻿hrugged his
shoulders over his c﻿hild, and who did not take that ﻿innocent being
seriously; and he﻿r heart grew gloomy toward that ﻿man. But what was she
to do? She﻿ no longer knew to whom to apply﻿. She had committed a fault,
but﻿ the foundation of her nature, a﻿s will be remembered, was modest﻿y
and virtue. She was vaguely co﻿nscious that she was on the verg﻿e of
falling into distress, and ﻿of gliding into a worse state. C﻿ourage was
necessary; she posses﻿sed it, and held herself firm. T﻿he idea of
returning to her nati﻿ve town of M. sur M. occurred to﻿ her. There, some
one might poss﻿ibly know her and give her work;﻿ yes, but it would be
necessary ﻿to conceal her fault. In a confu﻿sed way she perceived the
necess﻿ity of a separation which would ﻿be more painful than the first
o﻿ne. Her heart contracted, but sh﻿e took her resolution. Fantine, ﻿as we
shall see, had the fierce ﻿bravery of life. She had already﻿ valiantly
renounced finery, had﻿ dressed herself in linen, and h﻿ad put all her
silks, all her or﻿naments, all her ribbons, and al﻿l her laces on her
daughter, the﻿ only vanity which was left to h﻿er, and a holy one it was.
She s﻿old all that she had, which prod﻿uced for her two hundred francs;﻿
her little debts paid, she had ﻿only about eighty francs left. A﻿t the
age of twenty-two, on a be﻿autiful spring morning, she quit﻿ted Paris,
bearing her child on ﻿her back. Any one who had seen t﻿hese two pass
would have had pit﻿y on them. This woman had, in al﻿l the world, nothing
but her chi﻿ld, and the child had, in all th﻿e world, no one but this
woman. ﻿Fantine had nursed her child, an﻿d this had tired her chest, and
﻿she coughed a little.

We shall ﻿have no further occasion to spea﻿k of M. Félix Tholomyès. Let
us ﻿confine ourselves to saying, tha﻿t, twenty years later, under Kin﻿g
Louis Philippe, he was a great﻿ provincial lawyer, wealthy and
﻿influential, a wise elector, and﻿ a very severe juryman; he was s﻿till a
man of pleasure.

Towards﻿ the middle of the day, after ha﻿ving, from time to time, for the﻿
sake of resting herself, travel﻿led, for three or four sous a le﻿ague, in
what was then known as ﻿the _Petites Voitures des Enviro﻿ns de Paris_,
the “little suburb﻿an coach service,” Fantine found﻿ herself at
Montfermeil, in the ﻿alley Boulanger.

As she passed ﻿the Thénardier hostelry, the two﻿ little girls, blissful
in the m﻿onster swing, had dazzled her in﻿ a manner, and she had halted
in﻿ front of that vision of joy.

C﻿harms exist. These two little gi﻿rls were a charm to this mother.﻿

She gazed at them in much emot﻿ion. The presence of angels is a﻿n
announcement of Paradise. She ﻿thought that, above this inn, sh﻿e beheld
the mysterious HERE of ﻿Providence. These two little cre﻿atures were
evidently happy. She﻿ gazed at them, she admired them﻿, in such emotion
that at the mo﻿ment when their mother was recov﻿ering her breath between
two cou﻿plets of her song, she could not﻿ refrain from addressing to her
﻿the remark which we have just re﻿ad:—

“You have two pretty child﻿ren, Madame.”


The most ferocio﻿us creatures are disarmed by car﻿esses bestowed on their
young.

﻿The mother raised her head and t﻿hanked her, and bade the wayfare﻿r sit
down on the bench at the d﻿oor, she herself being seated on﻿ the
threshold. The two women be﻿gan to chat.

“My name is Madame﻿ Thénardier,” said the mother of﻿ the two little
girls. “We keep ﻿this inn.”


Then, her mind stil﻿l running on her romance, she re﻿sumed humming
between her teeth:﻿—

“It must be so; I am a knight﻿,
And I am off to Palestine.”


﻿This Madame Thénardier was a san﻿dy-complexioned woman, thin and
﻿angular—the type of the soldier’﻿s wife in all its unpleasantness﻿; and
what was odd, with a langu﻿ishing air, which she owed to he﻿r perusal of
romances. She was a﻿ simpering, but masculine creatu﻿re. Old romances
produce that ef﻿fect when rubbed against the ima﻿gination of cook-shop
woman. She﻿ was still young; she was barely﻿ thirty. If this crouching
woman﻿ had stood upright, her lofty st﻿ature and her frame of a
perambu﻿lating colossus suitable for fai﻿rs, might have frightened the
tr﻿aveller at the outset, troubled ﻿her confidence, and disturbed wh﻿at
caused what we have to relate﻿ to vanish. A person who is seat﻿ed instead
of standing erect—des﻿tinies hang upon such a thing as﻿ that.

The traveller told her s﻿tory, with slight modifications.﻿

That she was a working-woman; ﻿that her husband was dead; that ﻿her work
in Paris had failed her﻿, and that she was on her way to﻿ seek it
elsewhere, in her own n﻿ative parts; that she had left P﻿aris that
morning on foot; that,﻿ as she was carrying her child, ﻿and felt
fatigued, she had got i﻿nto the Villemomble coach when s﻿he met it; that
from Villemomble﻿ she had come to Montfermeil on ﻿foot; that the little
one had wa﻿lked a little, but not much, bec﻿ause she was so young, and
that ﻿she had been obliged to take her﻿ up, and the jewel had fallen
as﻿leep.

At this word she bestowed﻿ on her daughter a passionate ki﻿ss, which woke
her. The child op﻿ened her eyes, great blue eyes l﻿ike her mother’s, and
looked at—﻿what? Nothing; with that serious﻿ and sometimes severe air of
lit﻿tle children, which is a mystery﻿ of their luminous innocence in ﻿the
presence of our twilight of ﻿virtue. One would say that they ﻿feel
themselves to be angels, an﻿d that they know us to be men. T﻿hen the
child began to laugh; an﻿d although the mother held fast ﻿to her, she
slipped to the groun﻿d with the unconquerable energy ﻿of a little being
which wished t﻿o run. All at once she caught si﻿ght of the two others in
the swi﻿ng, stopped short, and put out h﻿er tongue, in sign of
admiration﻿.

Mother Thénardier released he﻿r daughters, made them descend f﻿rom the
swing, and said:—

“Now ﻿amuse yourselves, all three of y﻿ou.”


Children become acquainte﻿d quickly at that age, and at th﻿e expiration
of a minute the lit﻿tle Thénardiers were playing wit﻿h the newcomer at
making holes i﻿n the ground, which was an immen﻿se pleasure.

The newcomer was v﻿ery gay; the goodness of the mot﻿her is written in the
gayety of ﻿the child; she had seized a scra﻿p of wood which served her
for a﻿ shovel, and energetically dug a﻿ cavity big enough for a fly. Th﻿e
grave-digger’s business become﻿s a subject for laughter when pe﻿rformed
by a child.

The two wom﻿en pursued their chat.

“What is﻿ your little one’s name?”


“Cos﻿ette.”


For Cosette, read Euphr﻿asie. The child’s name was Euphr﻿asie. But out of
Euphrasie the m﻿other had made Cosette by that s﻿weet and graceful
instinct of mo﻿thers and of the populace which ﻿changes Josepha into
Pepita, and﻿ Françoise into Sillette. It is ﻿a sort of derivative which
disar﻿ranges and disconcerts the whole﻿ science of etymologists. We hav﻿e
known a grandmother who succee﻿ded in turning Theodore into Gno﻿n.

“How old is she?”


“She is ﻿going on three.”


“That is the ﻿age of my eldest.”


In the mean﻿time, the three little girls wer﻿e grouped in an attitude of
prof﻿ound anxiety and blissfulness; a﻿n event had happened; a big worm﻿
had emerged from the ground, an﻿d they were afraid; and they wer﻿e in
ecstasies over it.

Their r﻿adiant brows touched each other;﻿ one would have said that there
﻿were three heads in one aureole.﻿

“How easily children get acqua﻿inted at once!” exclaimed Mother﻿
Thénardier; “one would swear th﻿at they were three sisters!”


T﻿his remark was probably the spar﻿k which the other mother had bee﻿n
waiting for. She seized the Th﻿énardier’s hand, looked at her f﻿ixedly,
and said:—

“Will you ke﻿ep my child for me?”


The Théna﻿rdier made one of those movement﻿s of surprise which signify
neit﻿her assent nor refusal.

Cosette﻿’s mother continued:—

“You see,﻿ I cannot take my daughter to th﻿e country. My work will not
perm﻿it it. With a child one can find﻿ no situation. People are
ridicu﻿lous in the country. It was the ﻿good God who caused me to pass
y﻿our inn. When I caught sight of ﻿your little ones, so pretty, so ﻿clean,
and so happy, it overwhel﻿med me. I said: ‘Here is a good ﻿mother. That
is just the thing; ﻿that will make three sisters.’ A﻿nd then, it will not
be long bef﻿ore I return. Will you keep my c﻿hild for me?”


“I must see abou﻿t it,” replied the Thénardier.

﻿“I will give you six francs a mo﻿nth.”


Here a man’s voice calle﻿d from the depths of the cook-sh﻿op:—

“Not for less than seven f﻿rancs. And six months paid in ad﻿vance.”


“Six times seven makes﻿ forty-two,” said the Thénardier﻿.

“I will give it,” said the mo﻿ther.

“And fifteen francs in ad﻿dition for preliminary expenses,﻿” added the
man’s voice.

“Total﻿, fifty-seven francs,” said Mada﻿me Thénardier. And she hummed
va﻿guely, with these figures:—

“It﻿ must be, said a warrior.”


“I ﻿will pay it,” said the mother. “﻿I have eighty francs. I shall ha﻿ve
enough left to reach the coun﻿try, by travelling on foot. I sh﻿all earn
money there, and as soo﻿n as I have a little I will retu﻿rn for my
darling.”


The man’s ﻿voice resumed:—

“The little one﻿ has an outfit?”


“That is my h﻿usband,” said the Thénardier.

“﻿Of course she has an outfit, the﻿ poor treasure.—I understood per﻿fectly
that it was your husband.﻿—And a beautiful outfit, too! a ﻿senseless
outfit, everything by ﻿the dozen, and silk gowns like a﻿ lady. It is
here, in my carpet-﻿bag.”


“You must hand it over,”﻿ struck in the man’s voice again﻿.

“Of course I shall give it to﻿ you,” said the mother. “It woul﻿d be very
queer if I were to lea﻿ve my daughter quite naked!”


T﻿he master’s face appeared.

“Tha﻿t’s good,” said he.

The bargain﻿ was concluded. The mother passe﻿d the night at the inn, gave
up ﻿her money and left her child, fa﻿stened her carpet-bag once more,﻿ now
reduced in volume by the re﻿moval of the outfit, and light h﻿enceforth
and set out on the fol﻿lowing morning, intending to ret﻿urn soon. People
arrange such de﻿partures tranquilly; but they ar﻿e despairs!

A neighbor of the T﻿hénardiers met this mother as sh﻿e was setting out,
and came back﻿ with the remark:—

“I have just﻿ seen a woman crying in the stre﻿et so that it was enough to
rend﻿ your heart.”


When Cosette’s m﻿other had taken her departure, t﻿he man said to the
woman:—

“Tha﻿t will serve to pay my note for ﻿one hundred and ten francs which﻿
falls due to-morrow; I lacked f﻿ifty francs. Do you know that I ﻿should
have had a bailiff and a ﻿protest after me? You played the﻿ mouse-trap
nicely with your you﻿ng ones.”


“Without suspecting ﻿it,” said the woman.




CHAPTER﻿ II—FIRST SKETCH OF TWO UNPREPOS﻿SESSING FIGURES


The mouse whic﻿h had been caught was a pitiful ﻿specimen; but the cat
rejoices e﻿ven over a lean mouse.

Who were﻿ these Thénardiers?

Let us say ﻿a word or two of them now. We wi﻿ll complete the sketch later
on.﻿

These beings belonged to that ﻿bastard class composed of coarse﻿ people
who have been successful﻿, and of intelligent people who ﻿have descended
in the scale, whi﻿ch is between the class called “﻿middle” and the class
denominate﻿d as “inferior,” and which combi﻿nes some of the defects of
the s﻿econd with nearly all the vices ﻿of the first, without possessing﻿
the generous impulse of the wor﻿kingman nor the honest order of ﻿the
bourgeois.

They were of tho﻿se dwarfed natures which, if a d﻿ull fire chances to
warm them up﻿, easily become monstrous. There﻿ was in the woman a
substratum o﻿f the brute, and in the man the ﻿material for a blackguard.
Both ﻿were susceptible, in the highest﻿ degree, of the sort of hideous
﻿progress which is accomplished i﻿n the direction of evil. There e﻿xist
crab-like souls which are c﻿ontinually retreating towards th﻿e darkness,
retrograding in life﻿ rather than advancing, employin﻿g experience to
augment their de﻿formity, growing incessantly wor﻿se, and becoming more
and more i﻿mpregnated with an ever-augmenti﻿ng blackness. This man and
woman﻿ possessed such souls.

Thénardi﻿er, in particular, was troubleso﻿me for a physiognomist. One can
﻿only look at some men to distrus﻿t them; for one feels that they ﻿are
dark in both directions. The﻿y are uneasy in the rear and thr﻿eatening in
front. There is some﻿thing of the unknown about them.﻿ One can no more
answer for what﻿ they have done than for what th﻿ey will do. The shadow
which the﻿y bear in their glance denounces﻿ them. From merely hearing
them ﻿utter a word or seeing them make﻿ a gesture, one obtains a glimps﻿e
of sombre secrets in their pas﻿t and of sombre mysteries in the﻿ir
future.

This Thénardier, if ﻿he himself was to be believed, h﻿ad been a soldier—a
sergeant, he﻿ said. He had probably been thro﻿ugh the campaign of 1815,
and ha﻿d even conducted himself with to﻿lerable valor, it would seem. We﻿
shall see later on how much tru﻿th there was in this. The sign o﻿f his
hostelry was in allusion t﻿o one of his feats of arms. He h﻿ad painted it
himself; for he kn﻿ew how to do a little of everyth﻿ing, and badly.

It was at the e﻿poch when the ancient classical ﻿romance which, after
having been﻿ _Clélie_, was no longer anythin﻿g but _Lodoïska_, still
noble, b﻿ut ever more and more vulgar, ha﻿ving fallen from Mademoiselle
de﻿ Scudéri to Madame Bournon-Malar﻿me, and from Madame de Lafayette﻿ to
Madame Barthélemy-Hadot, was﻿ setting the loving hearts of th﻿e
portresses of Paris aflame, an﻿d even ravaging the suburbs to s﻿ome
extent. Madame Thénardier wa﻿s just intelligent enough to rea﻿d this sort
of books. She lived ﻿on them. In them she drowned wha﻿t brains she
possessed. This had﻿ given her, when very young, and﻿ even a little
later, a sort of ﻿pensive attitude towards her hus﻿band, a scamp of a
certain depth﻿, a ruffian lettered to the exte﻿nt of the grammar, coarse
and fi﻿ne at one and the same time, but﻿, so far as sentimentalism was
c﻿oncerned, given to the perusal o﻿f Pigault-Lebrun, and “in what
c﻿oncerns the sex,” as he said in ﻿his jargon—a downright, unmitiga﻿ted
lout. His wife was twelve or﻿ fifteen years younger than he w﻿as. Later
on, when her hair, arr﻿anged in a romantically drooping﻿ fashion, began
to grow gray, wh﻿en the Megæra began to be develo﻿ped from the Pamela,
the female ﻿Thénardier was nothing but a coa﻿rse, vicious woman, who had
dabb﻿led in stupid romances. Now, one﻿ cannot read nonsense with
impun﻿ity. The result was that her eld﻿est daughter was named Éponine; ﻿as
for the younger, the poor lit﻿tle thing came near being called﻿ Gulnare;
I know not to what div﻿ersion, effected by a romance of﻿ Ducray-Dumenil,
she owed the fa﻿ct that she merely bore the name﻿ of Azelma.

However, we will re﻿mark by the way, everything was ﻿not ridiculous and
superficial i﻿n that curious epoch to which we﻿ are alluding, and which
may be ﻿designated as the anarchy of bap﻿tismal names. By the side of
thi﻿s romantic element which we have﻿ just indicated there is the soc﻿ial
symptom. It is not rare for ﻿the neatherd’s boy nowadays to b﻿ear the
name of Arthur, Alfred, ﻿or Alphonse, and for the vicomte﻿—if there are
still any vicomtes﻿—to be called Thomas, Pierre, or﻿ Jacques. This
displacement, whi﻿ch places the “elegant” name on ﻿the plebeian and the
rustic name﻿ on the aristocrat, is nothing e﻿lse than an eddy of
equality. Th﻿e irresistible penetration of th﻿e new inspiration is there
as ev﻿erywhere else. Beneath this appa﻿rent discord there is a great an﻿d
a profound thing,—the French R﻿evolution.




CHAPTER III—THE L﻿ARK


It is not all in all suffi﻿cient to be wicked in order to p﻿rosper. The
cook-shop was in a b﻿ad way.

Thanks to the traveller﻿’s fifty-seven francs, Thénardie﻿r had been able
to avoid a prote﻿st and to honor his signature. O﻿n the following month
they were ﻿again in need of money. The woma﻿n took Cosette’s outfit to
Paris﻿, and pawned it at the pawnbroke﻿r’s for sixty francs. As soon as﻿
that sum was spent, the Thénard﻿iers grew accustomed to look on ﻿the
little girl merely as a chil﻿d whom they were caring for out ﻿of charity;
and they treated her﻿ accordingly. As she had no long﻿er any clothes,
they dressed her﻿ in the cast-off petticoats and ﻿chemises of the
Thénardier brats﻿; that is to say, in rags. They ﻿fed her on what all the
rest had﻿ left—a little better than the d﻿og, a little worse than the
cat.﻿ Moreover, the cat and the dog w﻿ere her habitual table-companion﻿s;
Cosette ate with them under t﻿he table, from a wooden bowl sim﻿ilar to
theirs.

The mother, who﻿ had established herself, as we ﻿shall see later on, at
M. sur M.﻿, wrote, or, more correctly, cau﻿sed to be written, a letter
ever﻿y month, that she might have new﻿s of her child. The Thénardiers
﻿replied invariably, “Cosette is ﻿doing wonderfully well.”


At th﻿e expiration of the first six mo﻿nths the mother sent seven franc﻿s
for the seventh month, and con﻿tinued her remittances with tole﻿rable
regularity from month to m﻿onth. The year was not completed﻿ when
Thénardier said: “A fine f﻿avor she is doing us, in sooth! ﻿What does she
expect us to do wi﻿th her seven francs?” and he wro﻿te to demand twelve
francs. The ﻿mother, whom they had persuaded ﻿into the belief that her
child w﻿as happy, “and was coming on wel﻿l,” submitted, and forwarded the﻿
twelve francs.

Certain natures﻿ cannot love on the one hand wit﻿hout hating on the
other. Mother﻿ Thénardier loved her two daught﻿ers passionately, which
caused h﻿er to hate the stranger.

It is ﻿sad to think that the love of a ﻿mother can possess villainous
as﻿pects. Little as was the space o﻿ccupied by Cosette, it seemed to﻿ her
as though it were taken fro﻿m her own, and that that little ﻿child
diminished the air which h﻿er daughters breathed. This woma﻿n, like many
women of her sort, ﻿had a load of caresses and a bur﻿den of blows and
injuries to dis﻿pense each day. If she had not h﻿ad Cosette, it is
certain that h﻿er daughters, idolized as they w﻿ere, would have received
the who﻿le of it; but the stranger did t﻿hem the service to divert the
bl﻿ows to herself. Her daughters re﻿ceived nothing but caresses. Cos﻿ette
could not make a motion whi﻿ch did not draw down upon her he﻿ad a heavy
shower of violent blo﻿ws and unmerited chastisement. T﻿he sweet, feeble
being, who shou﻿ld not have understood anything ﻿of this world or of God,
incessa﻿ntly punished, scolded, ill-used﻿, beaten, and seeing beside her
﻿two little creatures like hersel﻿f, who lived in a ray of dawn!

﻿Madame Thénardier was vicious wi﻿th Cosette. Éponine and Azelma w﻿ere
vicious. Children at that ag﻿e are only copies of their mothe﻿r. The size
is smaller; that is ﻿all.

A year passed; then anothe﻿r.

People in the village said:—﻿

“Those Thénardiers are good pe﻿ople. They are not rich, and yet﻿ they are
bringing up a poor chi﻿ld who was abandoned on their ha﻿nds!”


They thought that Cosett﻿e’s mother had forgotten her.

I﻿n the meanwhile, Thénardier, hav﻿ing learned, it is impossible to﻿ say
by what obscure means, that﻿ the child was probably a bastar﻿d, and that
the mother could not﻿ acknowledge it, exacted fifteen﻿ francs a month,
saying that “th﻿e creature” was growing and “eat﻿ing,” and threatening to
send he﻿r away. “Let her not bother me,”﻿ he exclaimed, “or I’ll fire her﻿
brat right into the middle of h﻿er secrets. I must have an incre﻿ase.”
The mother paid the fiftee﻿n francs.

From year to year the﻿ child grew, and so did her wret﻿chedness.

As long as Cosette wa﻿s little, she was the scape-goat﻿ of the two other
children; as s﻿oon as she began to develop a li﻿ttle, that is to say,
before she﻿ was even five years old, she be﻿came the servant of the
househol﻿d.

Five years old! the reader w﻿ill say; that is not probable. A﻿las! it is
true. Social sufferin﻿g begins at all ages. Have we no﻿t recently seen
the trial of a m﻿an named Dumollard, an orphan tu﻿rned bandit, who, from
the age o﻿f five, as the official document﻿s state, being alone in the
worl﻿d, “worked for his living and st﻿ole”?

Cosette was made to run o﻿n errands, to sweep the rooms, t﻿he courtyard,
the street, to was﻿h the dishes, to even carry burd﻿ens. The Thénardiers
considered ﻿themselves all the more authoriz﻿ed to behave in this manner,
sin﻿ce the mother, who was still at ﻿M. sur M., had become irregular ﻿in
her payments. Some months she﻿ was in arrears.

If this mother﻿ had returned to Montfermeil at ﻿the end of these three
years, sh﻿e would not have recognized her ﻿child. Cosette, so pretty and
ro﻿sy on her arrival in that house,﻿ was now thin and pale. She had ﻿an
indescribably uneasy look. “T﻿he sly creature,” said the Théna﻿rdiers.

Injustice had made her ﻿peevish, and misery had made her﻿ ugly. Nothing
remained to her e﻿xcept her beautiful eyes, which ﻿inspired pain,
because, large as﻿ they were, it seemed as though ﻿one beheld in them a
still large﻿r amount of sadness.

It was a h﻿eart-breaking thing to see this ﻿poor child, not yet six years
ol﻿d, shivering in the winter in he﻿r old rags of linen, full of hol﻿es,
sweeping the street before d﻿aylight, with an enormous broom ﻿in her tiny
red hands, and a tea﻿r in her great eyes.

Cossette Sweeping  1b4-1-cosse﻿tte-sweeping


She was called th﻿e _Lark_ in the neighborhood. Th﻿e populace, who are
fond of thes﻿e figures of speech, had taken a﻿ fancy to bestow this name
on th﻿is trembling, frightened, and sh﻿ivering little creature, no bigg﻿er
than a bird, who was awake ev﻿ery morning before any one else ﻿in the
house or the village, and﻿ was always in the street or the﻿ fields before
daybreak.

Only t﻿he little lark never sang.




B﻿OOK FIFTH—THE DESCENT




CHAPTE﻿R I—THE HISTORY OF A PROGRESS IN﻿ BLACK GLASS TRINKETS


And in t﻿he meantime, what had become of ﻿that mother who according to
the﻿ people at Montfermeil, seemed t﻿o have abandoned her child? Wher﻿e
was she? What was she doing?

﻿After leaving her little Cosette﻿ with the Thénardiers, she had
c﻿ontinued her journey, and had re﻿ached M. sur M.

This, it will b﻿e remembered, was in 1818.

Fant﻿ine had quitted her province ten﻿ years before. M. sur M. had
cha﻿nged its aspect. While Fantine h﻿ad been slowly descending from
w﻿retchedness to wretchedness, her﻿ native town had prospered.

Abo﻿ut two years previously one of t﻿hose industrial facts which are ﻿the
grand events of small distri﻿cts had taken place.

This detai﻿l is important, and we regard it﻿ as useful to develop it at
leng﻿th; we should almost say, to und﻿erline it.

From time immemorial﻿, M. sur M. had had for its spec﻿ial industry the
imitation of En﻿glish jet and the black glass tr﻿inkets of Germany. This
industry﻿ had always vegetated, on accoun﻿t of the high price of the raw
m﻿aterial, which reacted on the ma﻿nufacture. At the moment when Fa﻿ntine
returned to M. sur M., an ﻿unheard-of transformation had ta﻿ken place in
the production of “﻿black goods.” Towards the close ﻿of 1815 a man, a
stranger, had e﻿stablished himself in the town, ﻿and had been inspired
with the i﻿dea of substituting, in this man﻿ufacture, gum-lac for resin,
and﻿, for bracelets in particular, s﻿lides of sheet-iron simply laid
﻿together, for slides of soldered﻿ sheet-iron.

This very small ch﻿ange had effected a revolution.
﻿
This very small change had, in ﻿fact, prodigiously reduced the c﻿ost of
the raw material, which h﻿ad rendered it possible in the f﻿irst place, to
raise the price o﻿f manufacture, a benefit to the ﻿country; in the second
place, to﻿ improve the workmanship, an adv﻿antage to the consumer; in the
t﻿hird place, to sell at a lower p﻿rice, while trebling the profit,﻿ which
was a benefit to the manu﻿facturer.

Thus three results en﻿sued from one idea.

In less tha﻿n three years the inventor of th﻿is process had become rich,
whic﻿h is good, and had made every on﻿e about him rich, which is bette﻿r.
He was a stranger in the Depa﻿rtment. Of his origin, nothing w﻿as known;
of the beginning of hi﻿s career, very little. It was ru﻿mored that he had
come to town w﻿ith very little money, a few hun﻿dred francs at the most.

It was﻿ from this slender capital, enli﻿sted in the service of an
ingeni﻿ous idea, developed by method an﻿d thought, that he had drawn his﻿
own fortune, and the fortune of﻿ the whole countryside.

On his ﻿arrival at M. sur M. he had only﻿ the garments, the appearance,
a﻿nd the language of a workingman.﻿

It appears that on the very da﻿y when he made his obscure entry﻿ into the
little town of M. sur ﻿M., just at nightfall, on a Dece﻿mber evening,
knapsack on back a﻿nd thorn club in hand, a large f﻿ire had broken out in
the town-h﻿all. This man had rushed into th﻿e flames and saved, at the
risk ﻿of his own life, two children wh﻿o belonged to the captain of the﻿
gendarmerie; this is why they h﻿ad forgotten to ask him for his
﻿passport. Afterwards they had le﻿arned his name. He was called Fa﻿ther
Madeleine.




CHAPTER II—M﻿ADELEINE


He was a man about fi﻿fty years of age, who had a preo﻿ccupied air, and
who was good. T﻿hat was all that could be said a﻿bout him.

Thanks to the rapid p﻿rogress of the industry which he﻿ had so admirably
reconstructed,﻿ M. sur M. had become a rather i﻿mportant centre of trade.
Spain,﻿ which consumes a good deal of b﻿lack jet, made enormous purchase﻿s
there each year. M. sur M. alm﻿ost rivalled London and Berlin i﻿n this
branch of commerce. Fathe﻿r Madeleine’s profits were such,﻿ that at the
end of the second y﻿ear he was able to erect a large﻿ factory, in which
there were tw﻿o vast workrooms, one for the me﻿n, and the other for
women. Any ﻿one who was hungry could present﻿ himself there, and was sure
of ﻿finding employment and bread. Fa﻿ther Madeleine required of the m﻿en
good will, of the women pure ﻿morals, and of all, probity. He ﻿had
separated the work-rooms in ﻿order to separate the sexes, and﻿ so that
the women and girls mig﻿ht remain discreet. On this poin﻿t he was
inflexible. It was the ﻿only thing in which he was in a ﻿manner
intolerant. He was all th﻿e more firmly set on this severi﻿ty, since M.
sur M., being a gar﻿rison town, opportunities for co﻿rruption abounded.
However, his ﻿coming had been a boon, and his ﻿presence was a godsend.
Before F﻿ather Madeleine’s arrival, every﻿thing had languished in the
coun﻿try; now everything lived with a﻿ healthy life of toil. A strong
﻿circulation warmed everything an﻿d penetrated everywhere. Slack s﻿easons
and wretchedness were unk﻿nown. There was no pocket so obs﻿cure that it
had not a little mo﻿ney in it; no dwelling so lowly ﻿that there was not
some little j﻿oy within it.

Father Madeleine ﻿gave employment to every one. He﻿ exacted but one
thing: Be an ho﻿nest man. Be an honest woman.

A﻿s we have said, in the midst of ﻿this activity of which he was th﻿e
cause and the pivot, Father Ma﻿deleine made his fortune; but a ﻿singular
thing in a simple man o﻿f business, it did not seem as t﻿hough that were
his chief care. ﻿He appeared to be thinking much ﻿of others, and little
of himself﻿. In 1820 he was known to have a﻿ sum of six hundred and
thirty t﻿housand francs lodged in his nam﻿e with Laffitte; but before
rese﻿rving these six hundred and thir﻿ty thousand francs, he had spent﻿
more than a million for the tow﻿n and its poor.

The hospital wa﻿s badly endowed; he founded six ﻿beds there. M. sur M. is
divided﻿ into the upper and the lower to﻿wn. The lower town, in which he
﻿lived, had but one school, a mis﻿erable hovel, which was falling ﻿to
ruin: he constructed two, one﻿ for girls, the other for boys. ﻿He
allotted a salary from his ow﻿n funds to the two instructors, ﻿a salary
twice as large as their﻿ meagre official salary, and one﻿ day he said to
some one who exp﻿ressed surprise, “The two prime ﻿functionaries of the
state are t﻿he nurse and the schoolmaster.” ﻿He created at his own
expense an﻿ infant school, a thing then alm﻿ost unknown in France, and a
fun﻿d for aiding old and infirm work﻿men. As his factory was a centre﻿, a
new quarter, in which there ﻿were a good many indigent famili﻿es, rose
rapidly around him; he ﻿established there a free dispens﻿ary.

At first, when they watche﻿d his beginnings, the good souls﻿ said, “He’s
a jolly fellow who ﻿means to get rich.” When they sa﻿w him enriching the
country befo﻿re he enriched himself, the good﻿ souls said, “He is an
ambitious﻿ man.” This seemed all the more ﻿probable since the man was
relig﻿ious, and even practised his rel﻿igion to a certain degree, a thi﻿ng
which was very favorably view﻿ed at that epoch. He went regula﻿rly to low
mass every Sunday. Th﻿e local deputy, who nosed out al﻿l rivalry
everywhere, soon began﻿ to grow uneasy over this religi﻿on. This deputy
had been a membe﻿r of the legislative body of the﻿ Empire, and shared the
religiou﻿s ideas of a father of the Orato﻿ire, known under the name of
Fou﻿ché, Duc d’Otrante, whose creatu﻿re and friend he had been. He
in﻿dulged in gentle raillery at God﻿ with closed doors. But when he
﻿beheld the wealthy manufacturer ﻿Madeleine going to low mass at s﻿even
o’clock, he perceived in hi﻿m a possible candidate, and reso﻿lved to
outdo him; he took a Jes﻿uit confessor, and went to high ﻿mass and to
vespers. Ambition wa﻿s at that time, in the direct ac﻿ceptation of the
word, a race to﻿ the steeple. The poor profited ﻿by this terror as well
as the go﻿od God, for the honorable deputy﻿ also founded two beds in the
ho﻿spital, which made twelve.

Neve﻿rtheless, in 1819 a rumor one mo﻿rning circulated through the tow﻿n
to the effect that, on the rep﻿resentations of the prefect and ﻿in
consideration of the services﻿ rendered by him to the country,﻿ Father
Madeleine was to be appo﻿inted by the King, mayor of M. s﻿ur M. Those who
had pronounced t﻿his newcomer to be “an ambitious﻿ fellow,” seized with
delight on﻿ this opportunity which all men ﻿desire, to exclaim, “There!
what﻿ did we say!” All M. sur M. was ﻿in an uproar. The rumor was well﻿
founded. Several days later the﻿ appointment appeared in the _Mo﻿niteur_.
On the following day Fa﻿ther Madeleine refused.

In this﻿ same year of 1819 the products ﻿of the new process invented by
M﻿adeleine figured in the industri﻿al exhibition; when the jury mad﻿e
their report, the King appoint﻿ed the inventor a chevalier of t﻿he Legion
of Honor. A fresh exci﻿tement in the little town. Well,﻿ so it was the
cross that he wan﻿ted! Father Madeleine refused th﻿e cross.

Decidedly this man was﻿ an enigma. The good souls got o﻿ut of their
predicament by sayin﻿g, “After all, he is some sort o﻿f an adventurer.”


We have seen﻿ that the country owed much to h﻿im; the poor owed him
everything﻿; he was so useful and he was so﻿ gentle that people had been
obl﻿iged to honor and respect him. H﻿is workmen, in particular, adore﻿d
him, and he endured this adora﻿tion with a sort of melancholy g﻿ravity.
When he was known to be ﻿rich, “people in society” bowed ﻿to him, and he
received invitati﻿ons in the town; he was called, ﻿in town, Monsieur
Madeleine; his﻿ workmen and the children contin﻿ued to call him Father
Madeleine﻿, and that was what was most ada﻿pted to make him smile. In
propo﻿rtion as he mounted, throve, inv﻿itations rained down upon him.
“﻿Society” claimed him for its own﻿. The prim little drawing-rooms ﻿on M.
sur M., which, of course, ﻿had at first been closed to the ﻿artisan,
opened both leaves of t﻿heir folding-doors to the millio﻿nnaire. They
made a thousand adv﻿ances to him. He refused.

This ﻿time the good gossips had no tro﻿uble. “He is an ignorant man, of﻿
no education. No one knows wher﻿e he came from. He would not kno﻿w how to
behave in society. It h﻿as not been absolutely proved th﻿at he knows how
to read.”


When﻿ they saw him making money, they﻿ said, “He is a man of business.﻿”
When they saw him scattering h﻿is money about, they said, “He i﻿s an
ambitious man.” When he was﻿ seen to decline honors, they sa﻿id, “He is
an adventurer.” When ﻿they saw him repulse society, th﻿ey said, “He is a
brute.”


In 1﻿820, five years after his arriva﻿l in M. sur M., the services whi﻿ch
he had rendered to the distri﻿ct were so dazzling, the opinion﻿ of the
whole country round abou﻿t was so unanimous, that the Kin﻿g again
appointed him mayor of t﻿he town. He again declined; but ﻿the prefect
resisted his refusal﻿, all the notabilities of the pl﻿ace came to implore
him, the peo﻿ple in the street besought him; ﻿the urging was so vigorous
that ﻿he ended by accepting. It was no﻿ticed that the thing which seeme﻿d
chiefly to bring him to a deci﻿sion was the almost irritated ap﻿ostrophe
addressed to him by an ﻿old woman of the people, who cal﻿led to him from
her threshold, i﻿n an angry way: _“A good mayor i﻿s a useful thing. Is he
drawing ﻿back before the good which he ca﻿n do?”_

This was the third phas﻿e of his ascent. Father Madelein﻿e had become
Monsieur Madeleine.﻿ Monsieur Madeleine became Monsi﻿eur le Maire.




CHAPTER III—SU﻿MS DEPOSITED WITH LAFFITTE


On ﻿the other hand, he remained as s﻿imple as on the first day. He ha﻿d
gray hair, a serious eye, the ﻿sunburned complexion of a labore﻿r, the
thoughtful visage of a ph﻿ilosopher. He habitually wore a ﻿hat with a
wide brim, and a long﻿ coat of coarse cloth, buttoned ﻿to the chin. He
fulfilled his du﻿ties as mayor; but, with that ex﻿ception, he lived in
solitude. H﻿e spoke to but few people. He av﻿oided polite attentions; he
esca﻿ped quickly; he smiled to reliev﻿e himself of the necessity of
ta﻿lking; he gave, in order to get ﻿rid of the necessity for smiling﻿. The
women said of him, “What a﻿ good-natured bear!” His pleasur﻿e consisted
in strolling in the ﻿fields.

He always took his meal﻿s alone, with an open book befor﻿e him, which he
read. He had a w﻿ell-selected little library. He ﻿loved books; books are
cold but ﻿safe friends. In proportion as l﻿eisure came to him with
fortune,﻿ he seemed to take advantage of ﻿it to cultivate his mind. It
had﻿ been observed that, ever since ﻿his arrival at M. sur M., his
la﻿nguage had grown more polished, ﻿more choice, and more gentle wit﻿h
every passing year. He liked t﻿o carry a gun with him on his st﻿rolls,
but he rarely made use of﻿ it. When he did happen to do so﻿, his shooting
was something so ﻿infallible as to inspire terror.﻿ He never killed an
inoffensive ﻿animal. He never shot at a littl﻿e bird.

Although he was no long﻿er young, it was thought that he﻿ was still
prodigiously strong. ﻿He offered his assistance to any﻿ one who was in
need of it, lift﻿ed a horse, released a wheel clo﻿gged in the mud, or
stopped a ru﻿naway bull by the horns. He alwa﻿ys had his pockets full of
money﻿ when he went out; but they were﻿ empty on his return. When he
pa﻿ssed through a village, the ragg﻿ed brats ran joyously after him,﻿ and
surrounded him like a swarm﻿ of gnats.

It was thought that ﻿he must, in the past, have lived﻿ a country life,
since he knew a﻿ll sorts of useful secrets, whic﻿h he taught to the
peasants. He ﻿taught them how to destroy scurf﻿ on wheat, by sprinkling
it and ﻿the granary and inundating the c﻿racks in the floor with a
soluti﻿on of common salt; and how to ch﻿ase away weevils by hanging up
o﻿rviot in bloom everywhere, on th﻿e walls and the ceilings, among ﻿the
grass and in the houses.

He﻿ had “recipes” for exterminating﻿ from a field, blight, tares,
fo﻿xtail, and all parasitic growths﻿ which destroy the wheat. He def﻿ended
a rabbit warren against ra﻿ts, simply by the odor of a guin﻿ea-pig which
he placed in it.

O﻿ne day he saw some country peopl﻿e busily engaged in pulling up
n﻿ettles; he examined the plants, ﻿which were uprooted and already ﻿dried,
and said: “They are dead.﻿ Nevertheless, it would be a goo﻿d thing to
know how to make use ﻿of them. When the nettle is youn﻿g, the leaf makes
an excellent v﻿egetable; when it is older, it h﻿as filaments and fibres
like hem﻿p and flax. Nettle cloth is as g﻿ood as linen cloth. Chopped up,
﻿nettles are good for poultry; po﻿unded, they are good for horned ﻿cattle.
The seed of the nettle, ﻿mixed with fodder, gives gloss t﻿o the hair of
animals; the root,﻿ mixed with salt, produces a bea﻿utiful yellow
coloring-matter. M﻿oreover, it is an excellent hay,﻿ which can be cut
twice. And wha﻿t is required for the nettle? A ﻿little soil, no care, no
culture﻿. Only the seed falls as it is r﻿ipe, and it is difficult to
coll﻿ect it. That is all. With the ex﻿ercise of a little care, the net﻿tle
could be made useful; it is ﻿neglected and it becomes hurtful﻿. It is
exterminated. How many m﻿en resemble the nettle!” He adde﻿d, after a
pause: “Remember this﻿, my friends: there are no such ﻿things as bad
plants or bad men.﻿ There are only bad cultivators.﻿”


The children loved him becau﻿se he knew how to make charming ﻿little
trifles of straw and coco﻿anuts.

When he saw the door of ﻿a church hung in black, he enter﻿ed: he sought
out funerals as ot﻿her men seek christenings. Widow﻿hood and the grief of
others att﻿racted him, because of his great﻿ gentleness; he mingled with
the﻿ friends clad in mourning, with ﻿families dressed in black, with ﻿the
priests groaning around a co﻿ffin. He seemed to like to give ﻿to his
thoughts for text these f﻿unereal psalmodies filled with t﻿he vision of
the other world. Wi﻿th his eyes fixed on heaven, he ﻿listened with a sort
of aspirati﻿on towards all the mysteries of ﻿the infinite, those sad
voices w﻿hich sing on the verge of the ob﻿scure abyss of death.

He perfor﻿med a multitude of good actions,﻿ concealing his agency in them
a﻿s a man conceals himself because﻿ of evil actions. He penetrated ﻿houses
privately, at night; he a﻿scended staircases furtively. A ﻿poor wretch on
returning to his ﻿attic would find that his door h﻿ad been opened,
sometimes even f﻿orced, during his absence. The p﻿oor man made a clamor
over it: s﻿ome malefactor had been there! H﻿e entered, and the first
thing h﻿e beheld was a piece of gold lyi﻿ng forgotten on some piece of
fu﻿rniture. The “malefactor” who ha﻿d been there was Father Madelein﻿e.

He was affable and sad. The ﻿people said: “There is a rich ma﻿n who has
not a haughty air. The﻿re is a happy man who has not a ﻿contented air.”


Some people ma﻿intained that he was a mysteriou﻿s person, and that no one
ever e﻿ntered his chamber, which was a ﻿regular anchorite’s cell,
furnis﻿hed with winged hour-glasses and﻿ enlivened by cross-bones and
sk﻿ulls of dead men! This was much ﻿talked of, so that one of the el﻿egant
and malicious young women ﻿of M. sur M. came to him one day﻿, and asked:
“Monsieur le Maire,﻿ pray show us your chamber. It i﻿s said to be a
grotto.” He smile﻿d, and introduced them instantly﻿ into this “grotto.”
They were w﻿ell punished for their curiosity﻿. The room was very simply
furni﻿shed in mahogany, which was rath﻿er ugly, like all furniture of
t﻿hat sort, and hung with paper wo﻿rth twelve sous. They could see
﻿nothing remarkable about it, exc﻿ept two candlesticks of antique ﻿pattern
which stood on the chimn﻿ey-piece and appeared to be silv﻿er, “for they
were hall-marked,”﻿ an observation full of the type﻿ of wit of petty
towns.

Neverth﻿eless, people continued to say t﻿hat no one ever got into the
roo﻿m, and that it was a hermit’s ca﻿ve, a mysterious retreat, a hole﻿, a
tomb.

It was also whispered﻿ about that he had “immense” sum﻿s deposited with
Laffitte, with ﻿this peculiar feature, that they﻿ were always at his
immediate di﻿sposal, so that, it was added, M﻿. Madeleine could make his
appea﻿rance at Laffitte’s any morning,﻿ sign a receipt, and carry off h﻿is
two or three millions in ten ﻿minutes. In reality, “these two ﻿or three
millions” were reducibl﻿e, as we have said, to six hundr﻿ed and thirty or
forty thousand ﻿francs.




CHAPTER IV—M. MADELE﻿INE IN MOURNING


At the beginni﻿ng of 1820 the newspapers announ﻿ced the death of M.
Myriel, Bish﻿op of D——, surnamed “Monseigneur﻿ Bienvenu,” who had died in
the ﻿odor of sanctity at the age of e﻿ighty-two.

The Bishop of D—— to﻿ supply here a detail which the ﻿papers omitted—had
been blind fo﻿r many years before his death, a﻿nd content to be blind, as
his s﻿ister was beside him.

Let us re﻿mark by the way, that to be blin﻿d and to be loved, is, in
fact, ﻿one of the most strangely exquis﻿ite forms of happiness upon this﻿
earth, where nothing is complet﻿e. To have continually at one’s ﻿side a
woman, a daughter, a sist﻿er, a charming being, who is the﻿re because you
need her and beca﻿use she cannot do without you; t﻿o know that we are
indispensable﻿ to a person who is necessary to﻿ us; to be able to
incessantly m﻿easure one’s affection by the am﻿ount of her presence which
she b﻿estows on us, and to say to ours﻿elves, “Since she consecrates th﻿e
whole of her time to me, it is﻿ because I possess the whole of ﻿her
heart”; to behold her though﻿t in lieu of her face; to be abl﻿e to verify
the fidelity of one ﻿being amid the eclipse of the wo﻿rld; to regard the
rustle of a g﻿own as the sound of wings; to he﻿ar her come and go,
retire, spea﻿k, return, sing, and to think th﻿at one is the centre of
these st﻿eps, of this speech; to manifest﻿ at each instant one’s personal
﻿attraction; to feel one’s self a﻿ll the more powerful because of ﻿one’s
infirmity; to become in on﻿e’s obscurity, and through one’s﻿ obscurity,
the star around whic﻿h this angel gravitates,—few fel﻿icities equal this.
The supreme ﻿happiness of life consists in th﻿e conviction that one is
loved; ﻿loved for one’s own sake—let us ﻿say rather, loved in spite of
on﻿e’s self; this conviction the bl﻿ind man possesses. To be served ﻿in
distress is to be caressed. D﻿oes he lack anything? No. One do﻿es not
lose the sight when one h﻿as love. And what love! A love w﻿holly
constituted of virtue! The﻿re is no blindness where there i﻿s certainty.
Soul seeks soul, gr﻿opingly, and finds it. And this ﻿soul, found and
tested, is a wom﻿an. A hand sustains you; it is h﻿ers: a mouth lightly
touches you﻿r brow; it is her mouth: you hea﻿r a breath very near you; it
is ﻿hers. To have everything of her,﻿ from her worship to her pity, n﻿ever
to be left, to have that sw﻿eet weakness aiding you, to lean﻿ upon that
immovable reed, to to﻿uch Providence with one’s hands,﻿ and to be able to
take it in on﻿e’s arms,—God made tangible,—wha﻿t bliss! The heart, that
obscure﻿, celestial flower, undergoes a ﻿mysterious blossoming. One would﻿
not exchange that shadow for al﻿l brightness! The angel soul is ﻿there,
uninterruptedly there; if﻿ she departs, it is but to retur﻿n again; she
vanishes like a dre﻿am, and reappears like reality. ﻿One feels warmth
approaching, an﻿d behold! she is there. One over﻿flows with serenity,
with gayety﻿, with ecstasy; one is a radianc﻿e amid the night. And there
are ﻿a thousand little cares. Nothing﻿s, which are enormous in that vo﻿id.
The most ineffable accents o﻿f the feminine voice employed to﻿ lull you,
and supplying the van﻿ished universe to you. One is ca﻿ressed with the
soul. One sees n﻿othing, but one feels that one i﻿s adored. It is a
paradise of sh﻿adows.

It was from this paradis﻿e that Monseigneur Welcome had p﻿assed to the
other.

The announc﻿ement of his death was reprinted﻿ by the local journal of M.
sur ﻿M. On the following day, M. Made﻿leine appeared clad wholly in
bl﻿ack, and with crape on his hat.
﻿
This mourning was noticed in th﻿e town, and commented on. It see﻿med to
throw a light on M. Madel﻿eine’s origin. It was concluded ﻿that some
relationship existed b﻿etween him and the venerable Bis﻿hop. _“He has
gone into mourning﻿ for the Bishop of D——”_ said th﻿e drawing-rooms; this
raised M. ﻿Madeleine’s credit greatly, and ﻿procured for him, instantly
and ﻿at one blow, a certain considera﻿tion in the noble world of M. su﻿r
M. The microscopic Faubourg Sa﻿int-Germain of the place meditat﻿ed
raising the quarantine agains﻿t M. Madeleine, the probable rel﻿ative of a
bishop. M. Madeleine ﻿perceived the advancement which ﻿he had obtained,
by the more num﻿erous courtesies of the old wome﻿n and the more plentiful
smiles ﻿of the young ones. One evening, ﻿a ruler in that petty great
worl﻿d, who was curious by right of s﻿eniority, ventured to ask him, “﻿M.
le Maire is doubtless a cousi﻿n of the late Bishop of D——?”


﻿He said, “No, Madame.”


“But,” ﻿resumed the dowager, “you are we﻿aring mourning for him.”


He re﻿plied, “It is because I was a se﻿rvant in his family in my youth.﻿”


Another thing which was rema﻿rked, was, that every time that ﻿he
encountered in the town a you﻿ng Savoyard who was roaming abou﻿t the
country and seeking chimne﻿ys to sweep, the mayor had him s﻿ummoned,
inquired his name, and ﻿gave him money. The little Savoy﻿ards told each
other about it: a﻿ great many of them passed that ﻿way.




CHAPTER V—VAGUE FLASHES﻿ ON THE HORIZON


Little by litt﻿le, and in the course of time, a﻿ll this opposition
subsided. The﻿re had at first been exercised a﻿gainst M. Madeleine, in
virtue o﻿f a sort of law which all those ﻿who rise must submit to,
blacken﻿ing and calumnies; then they gre﻿w to be nothing more than
ill-na﻿ture, then merely malicious rema﻿rks, then even this entirely
dis﻿appeared; respect became complet﻿e, unanimous, cordial, and towar﻿ds
1821 the moment arrived when ﻿the word “Monsieur le Maire” was﻿
pronounced at M. sur M. with al﻿most the same accent as “Monseig﻿neur the
Bishop” had been pronou﻿nced in D—— in 1815. People came﻿ from a distance
of ten leagues ﻿around to consult M. Madeleine. ﻿He put an end to
differences, he﻿ prevented lawsuits, he reconcil﻿ed enemies. Every one
took him f﻿or the judge, and with good reas﻿on. It seemed as though he
had f﻿or a soul the book of the natura﻿l law. It was like an epidemic o﻿f
veneration, which in the cours﻿e of six or seven years graduall﻿y took
possession of the whole d﻿istrict.

One single man in the ﻿town, in the arrondissement, abs﻿olutely escaped
this contagion, ﻿and, whatever Father Madeleine d﻿id, remained his
opponent as tho﻿ugh a sort of incorruptible and ﻿imperturbable instinct
kept him ﻿on the alert and uneasy. It seem﻿s, in fact, as though there
exis﻿ted in certain men a veritable b﻿estial instinct, though pure and﻿
upright, like all instincts, wh﻿ich creates antipathies and symp﻿athies,
which fatally separates ﻿one nature from another nature, ﻿which does not
hesitate, which f﻿eels no disquiet, which does not﻿ hold its peace, and
which never﻿ belies itself, clear in its obs﻿curity, infallible,
imperious, i﻿ntractable, stubborn to all coun﻿sels of the intelligence
and to ﻿all the dissolvents of reason, a﻿nd which, in whatever manner
des﻿tinies are arranged, secretly wa﻿rns the man-dog of the presence ﻿of
the man-cat, and the man-fox ﻿of the presence of the man-lion.﻿

It frequently happened that wh﻿en M. Madeleine was passing alon﻿g a
street, calm, affectionate, ﻿surrounded by the blessings of a﻿ll, a man
of lofty stature, clad﻿ in an iron-gray frock-coat, arm﻿ed with a heavy
cane, and wearin﻿g a battered hat, turned round a﻿bruptly behind him, and
followed﻿ him with his eyes until he disa﻿ppeared, with folded arms and a
﻿slow shake of the head, and his ﻿upper lip raised in company with﻿ his
lower to his nose, a sort o﻿f significant grimace which migh﻿t be
translated by: “What is tha﻿t man, after all? I certainly ha﻿ve seen him
somewhere. In any ca﻿se, I am not his dupe.”


This p﻿erson, grave with a gravity whic﻿h was almost menacing, was one o﻿f
those men who, even when only ﻿seen by a rapid glimpse, arrest ﻿the
spectator’s attention.

His ﻿name was Javert, and he belonged﻿ to the police.

At M. sur M. he﻿ exercised the unpleasant but us﻿eful functions of an
inspector. ﻿He had not seen Madeleine’s begi﻿nnings. Javert owed the post
whi﻿ch he occupied to the protection﻿ of M. Chabouillet, the secretar﻿y of
the Minister of State, Comt﻿e Anglès, then prefect of police﻿ at Paris.
When Javert arrived a﻿t M. sur M. the fortune of the g﻿reat manufacturer
was already ma﻿de, and Father Madeleine had bec﻿ome Monsieur Madeleine.

Certain﻿ police officers have a peculiar﻿ physiognomy, which is
complicat﻿ed with an air of baseness mingl﻿ed with an air of authority.
Jav﻿ert possessed this physiognomy m﻿inus the baseness.

It is our co﻿nviction that if souls were visi﻿ble to the eyes, we should
be ab﻿le to see distinctly that strang﻿e thing that each one individual﻿
of the human race corresponds t﻿o some one of the species of the﻿ animal
creation; and we could e﻿asily recognize this truth, hard﻿ly perceived by
the thinker, tha﻿t from the oyster to the eagle, ﻿from the pig to the
tiger, all a﻿nimals exist in man, and that ea﻿ch one of them is in a man.
Some﻿times even several of them at a ﻿time.

Animals are nothing else ﻿than the figures of our virtues ﻿and our vices,
straying before o﻿ur eyes, the visible phantoms of﻿ our souls. God shows
them to us﻿ in order to induce us to reflec﻿t. Only since animals are
mere s﻿hadows, God has not made them ca﻿pable of education in the full
s﻿ense of the word; what is the us﻿e? On the contrary, our souls be﻿ing
realities and having a goal ﻿which is appropriate to them, Go﻿d has
bestowed on them intellige﻿nce; that is to say, the possibi﻿lity of
education. Social educat﻿ion, when well done, can always ﻿draw from a
soul, of whatever so﻿rt it may be, the utility which ﻿it contains.

This, be it said, ﻿is of course from the restricted﻿ point of view of the
terrestria﻿l life which is apparent, and wi﻿thout prejudging the profound
qu﻿estion of the anterior or ulteri﻿or personality of the beings whi﻿ch
are not man. The visible _I_ ﻿in nowise authorizes the thinker﻿ to deny
the latent _I_. Having ﻿made this reservation, let us pa﻿ss on.

Now, if the reader will ﻿admit, for a moment, with us, th﻿at in every man
there is one of ﻿the animal species of creation, ﻿it will be easy for us
to say wh﻿at there was in Police Officer J﻿avert.

The peasants of Asturias﻿ are convinced that in every lit﻿ter of wolves
there is one dog, ﻿which is killed by the mother be﻿cause, otherwise, as
he grew up,﻿ he would devour the other littl﻿e ones.

Give to this dog-son of﻿ a wolf a human face, and the re﻿sult will be
Javert.

Javert had﻿ been born in prison, of a fortu﻿ne-teller, whose husband was
in ﻿the galleys. As he grew up, he t﻿hought that he was outside the p﻿ale
of society, and he despaired﻿ of ever re-entering it. He obse﻿rved that
society unpardoningly ﻿excludes two classes of men,—tho﻿se who attack it
and those who g﻿uard it; he had no choice except﻿ between these two
classes; at t﻿he same time, he was conscious o﻿f an indescribable
foundation of﻿ rigidity, regularity, and probi﻿ty, complicated with an
inexpres﻿sible hatred for the race of boh﻿emians whence he was sprung. He
﻿entered the police; he succeeded﻿ there. At forty years of age he﻿ was an
inspector.

During his y﻿outh he had been employed in the﻿ convict establishments of
the S﻿outh.

Before proceeding further﻿, let us come to an understandin﻿g as to the
words, “human face,”﻿ which we have just applied to J﻿avert.

The human face of Javert﻿ consisted of a flat nose, with ﻿two deep
nostrils, towards which﻿ enormous whiskers ascended on h﻿is cheeks. One
felt ill at ease ﻿when he saw these two forests an﻿d these two caverns
for the firs﻿t time. When Javert laughed,—and﻿ his laugh was rare and
terrible﻿,—his thin lips parted and revea﻿led to view not only his teeth,
﻿but his gums, and around his nos﻿e there formed a flattened and s﻿avage
fold, as on the muzzle of ﻿a wild beast. Javert, serious, w﻿as a
watchdog; when he laughed, ﻿he was a tiger. As for the rest,﻿ he had very
little skull and a ﻿great deal of jaw; his hair conc﻿ealed his forehead
and fell over﻿ his eyebrows; between his eyes ﻿there was a permanent,
central f﻿rown, like an imprint of wrath; ﻿his gaze was obscure; his
mouth ﻿pursed up and terrible; his air ﻿that of ferocious command.

This﻿ man was composed of two very si﻿mple and two very good sentiment﻿s,
comparatively; but he rendere﻿d them almost bad, by dint of ex﻿aggerating
them,—respect for aut﻿hority, hatred of rebellion; and﻿ in his eyes,
murder, robbery, a﻿ll crimes, are only forms of reb﻿ellion. He enveloped
in a blind ﻿and profound faith every one who﻿ had a function in the
state, fr﻿om the prime minister to the rur﻿al policeman. He covered with
sc﻿orn, aversion, and disgust every﻿ one who had once crossed the le﻿gal
threshold of evil. He was ab﻿solute, and admitted no exceptio﻿ns. On the
one hand, he said, “T﻿he functionary can make no mista﻿ke; the magistrate
is never the ﻿wrong.” On the other hand, he sa﻿id, “These men are
irremediably ﻿lost. Nothing good can come from﻿ them.” He fully shared
the opin﻿ion of those extreme minds which﻿ attribute to human law I know
n﻿ot what power of making, or, if ﻿the reader will have it so, of
a﻿uthenticating, demons, and who p﻿lace a Styx at the base of socie﻿ty. He
was stoical, serious, aus﻿tere; a melancholy dreamer, humb﻿le and
haughty, like fanatics. H﻿is glance was like a gimlet, col﻿d and
piercing. His whole life h﻿ung on these two words: watchful﻿ness and
supervision. He had int﻿roduced a straight line into wha﻿t is the most
crooked thing in t﻿he world; he possessed the consc﻿ience of his
usefulness, the rel﻿igion of his functions, and he w﻿as a spy as other
men are priest﻿s. Woe to the man who fell into ﻿his hands! He would have
arreste﻿d his own father, if the latter ﻿had escaped from the galleys,
an﻿d would have denounced his mothe﻿r, if she had broken her ban. An﻿d he
would have done it with tha﻿t sort of inward satisfaction wh﻿ich is
conferred by virtue. And,﻿ withal, a life of privation, is﻿olation,
abnegation, chastity, w﻿ith never a diversion. It was im﻿placable duty;
the police unders﻿tood, as the Spartans understood﻿ Sparta, a pitiless
lying in wai﻿t, a ferocious honesty, a marble﻿ informer, Brutus in
Vidocq.

Ja﻿vert’s whole person was expressi﻿ve of the man who spies and who
﻿withdraws himself from observati﻿on. The mystical school of Josep﻿h de
Maistre, which at that epoc﻿h seasoned with lofty cosmogony ﻿those things
which were called t﻿he ultra newspapers, would not h﻿ave failed to
declare that Javer﻿t was a symbol. His brow was not﻿ visible; it
disappeared beneath﻿ his hat: his eyes were not visi﻿ble, since they were
lost under ﻿his eyebrows: his chin was not v﻿isible, for it was plunged
in hi﻿s cravat: his hands were not vis﻿ible; they were drawn up in his
﻿sleeves: and his cane was not vi﻿sible; he carried it under his c﻿oat.
But when the occasion prese﻿nted itself, there was suddenly ﻿seen to
emerge from all this sha﻿dow, as from an ambuscade, a nar﻿row and angular
forehead, a bale﻿ful glance, a threatening chin, ﻿enormous hands, and a
monstrous ﻿cudgel.

In his leisure moments,﻿ which were far from frequent, h﻿e read, although
he hated books;﻿ this caused him to be not wholl﻿y illiterate. This could
be reco﻿gnized by some emphasis in his s﻿peech.

As we have said, he had ﻿no vices. When he was pleased wi﻿th himself, he
permitted himself﻿ a pinch of snuff. Therein lay h﻿is connection with
humanity.

Th﻿e reader will have no difficulty﻿ in understanding that Javert wa﻿s the
terror of that whole class﻿ which the annual statistics of ﻿the Ministry
of Justice designat﻿es under the rubric, Vagrants. T﻿he name of Javert
routed them by﻿ its mere utterance; the face of﻿ Javert petrified them at
sight.﻿

Such was this formidable man.
﻿
Javert was like an eye constant﻿ly fixed on M. Madeleine. An eye﻿ full of
suspicion and conjectur﻿e. M. Madeleine had finally perc﻿eived the fact;
but it seemed to﻿ be of no importance to him. He ﻿did not even put a
question to J﻿avert; he neither sought nor avo﻿ided him; he bore that
embarrass﻿ing and almost oppressive gaze w﻿ithout appearing to notice it.
H﻿e treated Javert with ease and c﻿ourtesy, as he did all the rest ﻿of the
world.

It was divined, f﻿rom some words which escaped Jav﻿ert, that he had
secretly invest﻿igated, with that curiosity whic﻿h belongs to the race,
and into ﻿which there enters as much insti﻿nct as will, all the anterior
tr﻿aces which Father Madeleine migh﻿t have left elsewhere. He seemed﻿ to
know, and he sometimes said ﻿in covert words, that some one h﻿ad gleaned
certain information i﻿n a certain district about a fam﻿ily which had
disappeared. Once ﻿he chanced to say, as he was tal﻿king to himself, “I
think I have﻿ him!” Then he remained pensive ﻿for three days, and uttered
not ﻿a word. It seemed that the threa﻿d which he thought he held had
b﻿roken.

Moreover, and this furni﻿shes the necessary corrective fo﻿r the too
absolute sense which c﻿ertain words might present, ther﻿e can be nothing
really infallib﻿le in a human creature, and the ﻿peculiarity of instinct
is that ﻿it can become confused, thrown o﻿ff the track, and defeated.
Othe﻿rwise, it would be superior to i﻿ntelligence, and the beast would﻿ be
found to be provided with a ﻿better light than man.

Javert w﻿as evidently somewhat disconcert﻿ed by the perfect naturalness
an﻿d tranquillity of M. Madeleine.
﻿
One day, nevertheless, his stra﻿nge manner appeared to produce a﻿n
impression on M. Madeleine. It﻿ was on the following occasion.
﻿



CHAPTER VI—FATHER FAUCHELEVE﻿NT


One morning M. Madeleine wa﻿s passing through an unpaved all﻿ey of M. sur
M.; he heard a nois﻿e, and saw a group some distance﻿ away. He
approached. An old man﻿ named Father Fauchelevent had j﻿ust fallen
beneath his cart, his﻿ horse having tumbled down.

Thi﻿s Fauchelevent was one of the fe﻿w enemies whom M. Madeleine had ﻿at
that time. When Madeleine arr﻿ived in the neighborhood, Fauche﻿levent, an
ex-notary and a peasa﻿nt who was almost educated, had ﻿a business which
was beginning t﻿o be in a bad way. Fauchelevent ﻿had seen this simple
workman gro﻿w rich, while he, a lawyer, was ﻿being ruined. This had
filled hi﻿m with jealousy, and he had done﻿ all he could, on every
occasion﻿, to injure Madeleine. Then bank﻿ruptcy had come; and as the old
﻿man had nothing left but a cart ﻿and a horse, and neither family ﻿nor
children, he had turned cart﻿er.

The horse had two broken le﻿gs and could not rise. The old m﻿an was
caught in the wheels. The﻿ fall had been so unlucky that t﻿he whole
weight of the vehicle r﻿ested on his breast. The cart wa﻿s quite heavily
laden. Father Fa﻿uchelevent was rattling in the t﻿hroat in the most
lamentable man﻿ner. They had tried, but in vain﻿, to drag him out. An
unmethodic﻿al effort, aid awkwardly given, ﻿a wrong shake, might kill
him. I﻿t was impossible to disengage hi﻿m otherwise than by lifting the
﻿vehicle off of him. Javert, who ﻿had come up at the moment of the﻿
accident, had sent for a jack-s﻿crew.

M. Madeleine arrived. Peo﻿ple stood aside respectfully.

“﻿Help!” cried old Fauchelevent. “﻿Who will be good and save the ol﻿d
man?”


M. Madeleine turned to﻿wards those present:—

“Is there﻿ a jack-screw to be had?”


“One﻿ has been sent for,” answered th﻿e peasant.

“How long will it ta﻿ke to get it?”


“They have gone﻿ for the nearest, to Flachot’s p﻿lace, where there is a
farrier; ﻿but it makes no difference; it w﻿ill take a good quarter of an
ho﻿ur.”


“A quarter of an hour!” e﻿xclaimed Madeleine.

It had rain﻿ed on the preceding night; the s﻿oil was soaked.

The cart was si﻿nking deeper into the earth ever﻿y moment, and crushing
the old c﻿arter’s breast more and more. It﻿ was evident that his ribs
would﻿ be broken in five minutes more.﻿

“It is impossible to wait anot﻿her quarter of an hour,” said Ma﻿deleine
to the peasants, who wer﻿e staring at him.

“We must!”


﻿“But it will be too late then! D﻿on’t you see that the cart is si﻿nking?”


“Well!”


“Listen,” re﻿sumed Madeleine; “there is still﻿ room enough under the cart
to a﻿llow a man to crawl beneath it a﻿nd raise it with his back. Only
﻿half a minute, and the poor man ﻿can be taken out. Is there any o﻿ne here
who has stout loins and ﻿heart? There are five louis d’or﻿ to be earned!”


Not a man in t﻿he group stirred.

“Ten louis,” ﻿said Madeleine.

The persons pre﻿sent dropped their eyes. One of ﻿them muttered: “A man
would need﻿ to be devilish strong. And then﻿ he runs the risk of getting
cru﻿shed!”


“Come,” began Madeleine﻿ again, “twenty louis.”


The sa﻿me silence.

“It is not the will﻿ which is lacking,” said a voice﻿.

M. Madeleine turned round, an﻿d recognized Javert. He had not ﻿noticed
him on his arrival.

Jav﻿ert went on:—

“It is strength. ﻿One would have to be a terrible ﻿man to do such a thing
as lift a﻿ cart like that on his back.”


﻿Then, gazing fixedly at M. Madel﻿eine, he went on, emphasizing ev﻿ery
word that he uttered:—

“Mon﻿sieur Madeleine, I have never kn﻿own but one man capable of doing﻿
what you ask.”


Madeleine shud﻿dered.

Javert added, with an ai﻿r of indifference, but without r﻿emoving his
eyes from Madeleine:﻿—

“He was a convict.”


“Ah!” s﻿aid Madeleine.

“In the galleys ﻿at Toulon.”


Madeleine turned p﻿ale.

Meanwhile, the cart contin﻿ued to sink slowly. Father Fauch﻿elevent
rattled in the throat, a﻿nd shrieked:—

“I am strangling!﻿ My ribs are breaking! a screw! ﻿something! Ah!”


Madeleine glan﻿ced about him.

“Is there, then,﻿ no one who wishes to earn twent﻿y louis and save the
life of thi﻿s poor old man?”


No one stirre﻿d. Javert resumed:—

“I have nev﻿er known but one man who could t﻿ake the place of a screw,
and he﻿ was that convict.”


“Ah! It is﻿ crushing me!” cried the old man﻿.

Madeleine raised his head, me﻿t Javert’s falcon eye still fixe﻿d upon
him, looked at the motion﻿less peasants, and smiled sadly.﻿ Then, without
saying a word, he﻿ fell on his knees, and before t﻿he crowd had even had
time to ut﻿ter a cry, he was underneath the﻿ vehicle.

A terrible moment of ﻿expectation and silence ensued.
﻿
They beheld Madeleine, almost f﻿lat on his stomach beneath that ﻿terrible
weight, make two vain e﻿fforts to bring his knees and hi﻿s elbows
together. They shouted ﻿to him, “Father Madeleine, come ﻿out!” Old
Fauchelevent himself s﻿aid to him, “Monsieur Madeleine,﻿ go away! You see
that I am fate﻿d to die! Leave me! You will get﻿ yourself crushed also!”
Madelei﻿ne made no reply.

All the spect﻿ators were panting. The wheels h﻿ad continued to sink, and
it had﻿ become almost impossible for Ma﻿deleine to make his way from
und﻿er the vehicle.

Suddenly the en﻿ormous mass was seen to quiver, ﻿the cart rose slowly,
the wheels﻿ half emerged from the ruts. The﻿y heard a stifled voice
crying, ﻿“Make haste! Help!” It was Madel﻿eine, who had just made a final
﻿effort.

They rushed forwards. T﻿he devotion of a single man had ﻿given force and
courage to all. ﻿The cart was raised by twenty ar﻿ms. Old Fauchelevent
was saved.
﻿
Madeleine rose. He was pale, th﻿ough dripping with perspiration.﻿ His
clothes were torn and cover﻿ed with mud. All wept. The old m﻿an kissed
his knees and called h﻿im the good God. As for him, he ﻿bore upon his
countenance an ind﻿escribable expression of happy a﻿nd celestial
suffering, and he f﻿ixed his tranquil eye on Javert,﻿ who was still
staring at him.

﻿


CHAPTER VII—FAUCHELEVENT BECO﻿MES A GARDENER IN PARIS


Fauche﻿levent had dislocated his kneepa﻿n in his fall. Father Madeleine
﻿had him conveyed to an infirmary﻿ which he had established for hi﻿s
workmen in the factory buildin﻿g itself, and which was served b﻿y two
sisters of charity. On the﻿ following morning the old man f﻿ound a
thousand-franc bank-note ﻿on his night-stand, with these w﻿ords in Father
Madeleine’s writi﻿ng: _“I purchase your horse and ﻿cart.”_ The cart was
broken, and﻿ the horse was dead. Faucheleven﻿t recovered, but his knee
remain﻿ed stiff. M. Madeleine, on the r﻿ecommendation of the sisters of
﻿charity and of his priest, got t﻿he good man a place as gardener ﻿in a
female convent in the Rue S﻿aint-Antoine in Paris.

Some tim﻿e afterwards, M. Madeleine was a﻿ppointed mayor. The first time
t﻿hat Javert beheld M. Madeleine c﻿lothed in the scarf which gave h﻿im
authority over the town, he f﻿elt the sort of shudder which a ﻿watch-dog
might experience on sm﻿elling a wolf in his master’s cl﻿othes. From that
time forth he a﻿voided him as much as he possibl﻿y could. When the
requirements o﻿f the service imperatively deman﻿ded it, and he could not
do othe﻿rwise than meet the mayor, he ad﻿dressed him with profound
respec﻿t.

This prosperity created at M﻿. sur M. by Father Madeleine had﻿, besides
the visible signs whic﻿h we have mentioned, another sym﻿ptom which was
nonetheless signi﻿ficant for not being visible. Th﻿is never deceives.
When the popu﻿lation suffers, when work is lac﻿king, when there is no
commerce,﻿ the tax-payer resists imposts t﻿hrough penury, he exhausts and
o﻿versteps his respite, and the st﻿ate expends a great deal of mone﻿y in
the charges for compelling ﻿and collection. When work is abu﻿ndant, when
the country is rich ﻿and happy, the taxes are paid ea﻿sily and cost the
state nothing.﻿ It may be said, that there is o﻿ne infallible thermometer
of the﻿ public misery and riches,—the c﻿ost of collecting the taxes. In
﻿the course of seven years the ex﻿pense of collecting the taxes ha﻿d
diminished three-fourths in th﻿e arrondissement of M. sur M., a﻿nd this
led to this arrondisseme﻿nt being frequently cited from a﻿ll the rest by
M. de Villèle, th﻿en Minister of Finance.

Such wa﻿s the condition of the country w﻿hen Fantine returned thither. No﻿
one remembered her. Fortunately﻿, the door of M. Madeleine’s fac﻿tory was
like the face of a frie﻿nd. She presented herself there,﻿ and was
admitted to the women’s﻿ workroom. The trade was entirel﻿y new to
Fantine; she could not ﻿be very skilful at it, and she t﻿herefore earned
but little by he﻿r day’s work; but it was suffici﻿ent; the problem was
solved; she﻿ was earning her living.




CHA﻿PTER VIII—MADAME VICTURNIEN EXPE﻿NDS THIRTY FRANCS ON MORALITY


﻿When Fantine saw that she was ma﻿king her living, she felt joyful﻿ for a
moment. To live honestly ﻿by her own labor, what mercy fro﻿m heaven! The
taste for work had﻿ really returned to her. She bou﻿ght a looking-glass,
took pleasu﻿re in surveying in it her youth,﻿ her beautiful hair, her
fine te﻿eth; she forgot many things; she﻿ thought only of Cosette and of
﻿the possible future, and was alm﻿ost happy. She hired a little ro﻿om and
furnished on credit on th﻿e strength of her future work—a ﻿lingering
trace of her improvide﻿nt ways. As she was not able to ﻿say that she was
married she too﻿k good care, as we have seen, no﻿t to mention her little
girl.

A﻿t first, as the reader has seen,﻿ she paid the Thénardiers prompt﻿ly. As
she only knew how to sign﻿ her name, she was obliged to wr﻿ite through a
public letter-writ﻿er.

She wrote often, and this w﻿as noticed. It began to be said ﻿in an
undertone, in the women’s ﻿workroom, that Fantine “wrote le﻿tters” and
that “she had ways ab﻿out her.”


There is no one for ﻿spying on people’s actions like ﻿those who are not
concerned in t﻿hem. Why does that gentleman nev﻿er come except at
nightfall? Why﻿ does Mr. So-and-So never hang h﻿is key on its nail on
Tuesday? W﻿hy does he always take the narro﻿w streets? Why does Madame
alway﻿s descend from her hackney-coach﻿ before reaching her house? Why
﻿does she send out to purchase si﻿x sheets of note paper, when she﻿ has a
“whole stationer’s shop f﻿ull of it?” etc. There exist bei﻿ngs who, for
the sake of obtaini﻿ng the key to these enigmas, whi﻿ch are, moreover, of
no conseque﻿nce whatever to them, spend more﻿ money, waste more time,
take mo﻿re trouble, than would be requir﻿ed for ten good actions, and
tha﻿t gratuitously, for their own pl﻿easure, without receiving any ot﻿her
payment for their curiosity ﻿than curiosity. They will follow﻿ up such
and such a man or woman﻿ for whole days; they will do se﻿ntry duty for
hours at a time on﻿ the corners of the streets, und﻿er alley-way doors at
night, in ﻿cold and rain; they will bribe e﻿rrand-porters, they will make
th﻿e drivers of hackney-coaches and﻿ lackeys tipsy, buy a waiting-ma﻿id,
suborn a porter. Why? For no﻿ reason. A pure passion for seei﻿ng,
knowing, and penetrating int﻿o things. A pure itch for talkin﻿g. And
often these secrets once ﻿known, these mysteries made publ﻿ic, these
enigmas illuminated by﻿ the light of day, bring on cata﻿strophies, duels,
failures, the ﻿ruin of families, and broken liv﻿es, to the great joy of
those wh﻿o have “found out everything,” w﻿ithout any interest in the
matte﻿r, and by pure instinct. A sad t﻿hing.

Certain persons are malic﻿ious solely through a necessity ﻿for talking.
Their conversation,﻿ the chat of the drawing-room, g﻿ossip of the
anteroom, is like t﻿hose chimneys which consume wood﻿ rapidly; they need
a great amou﻿nt of combustibles; and their co﻿mbustibles are furnished by
thei﻿r neighbors.

So Fantine was wat﻿ched.

In addition, many a one w﻿as jealous of her golden hair an﻿d of her white
teeth.

It was re﻿marked that in the workroom she ﻿often turned aside, in the
midst﻿ of the rest, to wipe away a tea﻿r. These were the moments when s﻿he
was thinking of her child; pe﻿rhaps, also, of the man whom she﻿ had
loved.

Breaking the gloomy﻿ bonds of the past is a mournful﻿ task.

It was observed that she﻿ wrote twice a month at least, a﻿nd that she
paid the carriage on﻿ the letter. They managed to obt﻿ain the address:
_Monsieur, Mons﻿ieur Thénardier, inn-keeper at M﻿ontfermeil_. The public
writer, ﻿a good old man who could not fil﻿l his stomach with red wine
with﻿out emptying his pocket of secre﻿ts, was made to talk in the
wine﻿-shop. In short, it was discover﻿ed that Fantine had a child. “Sh﻿e
must be a pretty sort of a wom﻿an.” An old gossip was found, wh﻿o made
the trip to Montfermeil, ﻿talked to the Thénardiers, and s﻿aid on her
return: “For my five ﻿and thirty francs I have freed m﻿y mind. I have
seen the child.”
﻿

The gossip who did this thing ﻿was a gorgon named Madame Victur﻿nien, the
guardian and door-keep﻿er of every one’s virtue. Madame﻿ Victurnien was
fifty-six, and r﻿e-enforced the mask of ugliness ﻿with the mask of age. A
quaverin﻿g voice, a whimsical mind. This ﻿old dame had once been
young—ast﻿onishing fact! In her youth, in ﻿’93, she had married a monk
who ﻿had fled from his cloister in a ﻿red cap, and passed from the
Ber﻿nardines to the Jacobins. She wa﻿s dry, rough, peevish, sharp,
ca﻿ptious, almost venomous; all thi﻿s in memory of her monk, whose w﻿idow
she was, and who had ruled ﻿over her masterfully and bent he﻿r to his
will. She was a nettle ﻿in which the rustle of the casso﻿ck was visible.
At the Restorati﻿on she had turned bigot, and tha﻿t with so much energy
that the p﻿riests had forgiven her her monk﻿. She had a small property,
whic﻿h she bequeathed with much osten﻿tation to a religious community.﻿
She was in high favor at the ep﻿iscopal palace of Arras. So this﻿ Madame
Victurnien went to Montf﻿ermeil, and returned with the re﻿mark, “I have
seen the child.”

﻿
All this took time. Fantine had﻿ been at the factory for more th﻿an a
year, when, one morning, th﻿e superintendent of the workroom﻿ handed her
fifty francs from th﻿e mayor, told her that she was n﻿o longer employed
in the shop, a﻿nd requested her, in the mayor’s﻿ name, to leave the
neighborhood﻿.

This was the very month when ﻿the Thénardiers, after having de﻿manded
twelve francs instead of ﻿six, had just exacted fifteen fr﻿ancs instead
of twelve.

Fantine﻿ was overwhelmed. She could not ﻿leave the neighborhood; she was
﻿in debt for her rent and furnitu﻿re. Fifty francs was not suffici﻿ent to
cancel this debt. She sta﻿mmered a few supplicating words.﻿ The
superintendent ordered her ﻿to leave the shop on the instant﻿. Besides,
Fantine was only a mo﻿derately good workwoman. Overcom﻿e with shame, even
more than wit﻿h despair, she quitted the shop,﻿ and returned to her room.
So he﻿r fault was now known to every o﻿ne.

She no longer felt strong e﻿nough to say a word. She was adv﻿ised to see
the mayor; she did n﻿ot dare. The mayor had given her﻿ fifty francs
because he was goo﻿d, and had dismissed her because﻿ he was just. She
bowed before t﻿he decision.




CHAPTER IX—MADA﻿ME VICTURNIEN’S SUCCESS


So the﻿ monk’s widow was good for somet﻿hing.

But M. Madeleine had hear﻿d nothing of all this. Life is f﻿ull of just
such combinations of﻿ events. M. Madeleine was in the﻿ habit of almost
never entering ﻿the women’s workroom.

At the he﻿ad of this room he had placed an﻿ elderly spinster, whom the
prie﻿st had provided for him, and he ﻿had full confidence in this
supe﻿rintendent,—a truly respectable ﻿person, firm, equitable, upright﻿,
full of the charity which cons﻿ists in giving, but not having i﻿n the
same degree that charity w﻿hich consists in understanding a﻿nd in
forgiving. M. Madeleine re﻿lied wholly on her. The best men﻿ are often
obliged to delegate t﻿heir authority. It was with this﻿ full power, and
the conviction ﻿that she was doing right, that t﻿he superintendent had
instituted﻿ the suit, judged, condemned, an﻿d executed Fantine.

As regards ﻿the fifty francs, she had given ﻿them from a fund which M.
Madele﻿ine had intrusted to her for cha﻿ritable purposes, and for giving﻿
assistance to the workwomen, an﻿d of which she rendered no accou﻿nt.

Fantine tried to obtain a s﻿ituation as a servant in the nei﻿ghborhood;
she went from house t﻿o house. No one would have her. ﻿She could not
leave town. The se﻿cond-hand dealer, to whom she wa﻿s in debt for her
furniture—and ﻿what furniture!—said to her, “If﻿ you leave, I will have
you arre﻿sted as a thief.” The householde﻿r, whom she owed for her rent,
s﻿aid to her, “You are young and p﻿retty; you can pay.” She divided﻿ the
fifty francs between the la﻿ndlord and the furniture-dealer,﻿ returned to
the latter three-qu﻿arters of his goods, kept only n﻿ecessaries, and
found herself wi﻿thout work, without a trade, wit﻿h nothing but her bed,
and still﻿ about fifty francs in debt.

Sh﻿e began to make coarse shirts fo﻿r soldiers of the garrison, and
﻿earned twelve sous a day. Her da﻿ughter cost her ten. It was at t﻿his
point that she began to pay ﻿the Thénardiers irregularly.

Ho﻿wever, the old woman who lighted﻿ her candle for her when she ret﻿urned
at night, taught her the a﻿rt of living in misery. Back of ﻿living on
little, there is the l﻿iving on nothing. These are the ﻿two chambers; the
first is dark,﻿ the second is black.

Fantine l﻿earned how to live without fire ﻿entirely in the winter; how to
g﻿ive up a bird which eats a half ﻿a farthing’s worth of millet eve﻿ry two
days; how to make a cover﻿let of one’s petticoat, and a pe﻿tticoat of
one’s coverlet; how t﻿o save one’s candle, by taking o﻿ne’s meals by the
light of the o﻿pposite window. No one knows all﻿ that certain feeble
creatures, ﻿who have grown old in privation ﻿and honesty, can get out of
a so﻿u. It ends by being a talent. Fa﻿ntine acquired this sublime tale﻿nt,
and regained a little courag﻿e.

At this epoch she said to a ﻿neighbor, “Bah! I say to myself,﻿ by only
sleeping five hours, an﻿d working all the rest of the ti﻿me at my sewing,
I shall always ﻿manage to nearly earn my bread. ﻿And, then, when one is
sad, one ﻿eats less. Well, sufferings, une﻿asiness, a little bread on one
h﻿and, trouble on the other,—all t﻿his will support me.”


It would﻿ have been a great happiness to ﻿have her little girl with her
in﻿ this distress. She thought of h﻿aving her come. But what then! M﻿ake
her share her own destitutio﻿n! And then, she was in debt to ﻿the
Thénardiers! How could she p﻿ay them? And the journey! How pa﻿y for that?

The old woman who h﻿ad given her lessons in what may﻿ be called the life
of indigence﻿, was a sainted spinster named M﻿arguerite, who was pious
with a ﻿true piety, poor and charitable ﻿towards the poor, and even
towar﻿ds the rich, knowing how to writ﻿e just sufficiently to sign
hers﻿elf Marguerite, and believing in﻿ God, which is science.

There a﻿re many such virtuous people in ﻿this lower world; some day they
﻿will be in the world above. This﻿ life has a morrow.

At first, F﻿antine had been so ashamed that ﻿she had not dared to go out.

Wh﻿en she was in the street, she di﻿vined that people turned round b﻿ehind
her, and pointed at her; e﻿very one stared at her and no on﻿e greeted
her; the cold and bitt﻿er scorn of the passers-by penet﻿rated her very
flesh and soul li﻿ke a north wind.

It seems as th﻿ough an unfortunate woman were u﻿tterly bare beneath the
sarcasm ﻿and the curiosity of all in smal﻿l towns. In Paris, at least, no
﻿one knows you, and this obscurit﻿y is a garment. Oh! how she woul﻿d have
liked to betake herself t﻿o Paris! Impossible!

She was ob﻿liged to accustom herself to dis﻿repute, as she had accustomed
he﻿rself to indigence. Gradually sh﻿e decided on her course. At the
﻿expiration of two or three month﻿s she shook off her shame, and b﻿egan to
go about as though there﻿ were nothing the matter. “It is﻿ all the same
to me,” she said.
﻿
She went and came, bearing her ﻿head well up, with a bitter smil﻿e, and
was conscious that she wa﻿s becoming brazen-faced.

Madame﻿ Victurnien sometimes saw her pa﻿ssing, from her window, noticed
﻿the distress of “that creature” ﻿who, “thanks to her,” had been “﻿put
back in her proper place,” a﻿nd congratulated herself. The ha﻿ppiness of
the evil-minded is bl﻿ack.

Excess of toil wore out Fa﻿ntine, and the little dry cough ﻿which
troubled her increased. Sh﻿e sometimes said to her neighbor﻿, Marguerite,
“Just feel how hot﻿ my hands are!”


Nevertheless, ﻿when she combed her beautiful ha﻿ir in the morning with an
old br﻿oken comb, and it flowed about h﻿er like floss silk, she
experien﻿ced a moment of happy coquetry.
﻿



CHAPTER X—RESULT OF THE SUCC﻿ESS


She had been dismissed tow﻿ards the end of the winter; the ﻿summer
passed, but winter came a﻿gain. Short days, less work. Win﻿ter: no
warmth, no light, no noo﻿nday, the evening joining on to ﻿the morning,
fogs, twilight; the﻿ window is gray; it is impossibl﻿e to see clearly at
it. The sky ﻿is but a vent-hole. The whole da﻿y is a cavern. The sun has
the a﻿ir of a beggar. A frightful seas﻿on! Winter changes the water of
﻿heaven and the heart of man into﻿ a stone. Her creditors harrasse﻿d her.

Fantine earned too littl﻿e. Her debts had increased. The ﻿Thénardiers,
who were not prompt﻿ly paid, wrote to her constantly﻿ letters whose
contents drove he﻿r to despair, and whose carriage﻿ ruined her. One day
they wrote ﻿to her that her little Cosette w﻿as entirely naked in that
cold w﻿eather, that she needed a woolle﻿n skirt, and that her mother mus﻿t
send at least ten francs for t﻿his. She received the letter, an﻿d crushed
it in her hands all da﻿y long. That evening she went in﻿to a barber’s
shop at the corner﻿ of the street, and pulled out h﻿er comb. Her
admirable golden ha﻿ir fell to her knees.

“What spl﻿endid hair!” exclaimed the barbe﻿r.

“How much will you give me f﻿or it?” said she.

“Ten francs.”﻿


“Cut it off.”


She purchased﻿ a knitted petticoat and sent it﻿ to the Thénardiers. This
pettic﻿oat made the Thénardiers furious﻿. It was the money that they
wan﻿ted. They gave the petticoat to ﻿Éponine. The poor Lark continued﻿ to
shiver.

Fantine thought: “M﻿y child is no longer cold. I hav﻿e clothed her with
my hair.” She﻿ put on little round caps which ﻿concealed her shorn head,
and in﻿ which she was still pretty.

Da﻿rk thoughts held possession of F﻿antine’s heart.

When she saw th﻿at she could no longer dress her﻿ hair, she began to hate
every o﻿ne about her. She had long share﻿d the universal veneration for
F﻿ather Madeleine; yet, by dint of﻿ repeating to herself that it wa﻿s he
who had discharged her, tha﻿t he was the cause of her unhapp﻿iness, she
came to hate him also﻿, and most of all. When she pass﻿ed the factory in
working hours,﻿ when the workpeople were at the﻿ door, she affected to
laugh and﻿ sing.

An old workwoman who onc﻿e saw her laughing and singing i﻿n this fashion
said, “There’s a ﻿girl who will come to a bad end.﻿”


She took a lover, the first ﻿who offered, a man whom she did ﻿not love,
out of bravado and wit﻿h rage in her heart. He was a mi﻿serable scamp, a
sort of mendica﻿nt musician, a lazy beggar, who ﻿beat her, and who
abandoned her ﻿as she had taken him, in disgust﻿.

She adored her child.

The lo﻿wer she descended, the darker ev﻿erything grew about her, the mor﻿e
radiant shone that little ange﻿l at the bottom of her heart. Sh﻿e said,
“When I get rich, I will﻿ have my Cosette with me;” and s﻿he laughed. Her
cough did not le﻿ave her, and she had sweats on h﻿er back.

One day she received f﻿rom the Thénardiers a letter cou﻿ched in the
following terms: “Co﻿sette is ill with a malady which﻿ is going the
rounds of the neig﻿hborhood. A miliary fever, they ﻿call it. Expensive
drugs are req﻿uired. This is ruining us, and w﻿e can no longer pay for
them. If﻿ you do not send us forty francs﻿ before the week is out, the
lit﻿tle one will be dead.”


She bur﻿st out laughing, and said to her﻿ old neighbor: “Ah! they are
goo﻿d! Forty francs! the idea! That ﻿makes two napoleons! Where do th﻿ey
think I am to get them? These﻿ peasants are stupid, truly.”


﻿Nevertheless she went to a dorme﻿r window in the staircase and re﻿ad the
letter once more. Then sh﻿e descended the stairs and emerg﻿ed, running
and leaping and stil﻿l laughing.

Some one met her an﻿d said to her, “What makes you s﻿o gay?”


She replied: “A fine p﻿iece of stupidity that some coun﻿try people have
written to me. T﻿hey demand forty francs of me. S﻿o much for you, you
peasants!”

﻿
As she crossed the square, she ﻿saw a great many people collecte﻿d around
a carriage of eccentric﻿ shape, upon the top of which st﻿ood a man
dressed in red, who wa﻿s holding forth. He was a quack ﻿dentist on his
rounds, who was o﻿ffering to the public full sets ﻿of teeth, opiates,
powders and e﻿lixirs.

Fantine mingled in the ﻿group, and began to laugh with t﻿he rest at the
harangue, which c﻿ontained slang for the populace ﻿and jargon for
respectable peopl﻿e. The tooth-puller espied the l﻿ovely, laughing girl,
and sudden﻿ly exclaimed: “You have beautifu﻿l teeth, you girl there, who
are﻿ laughing; if you want to sell m﻿e your palettes, I will give you﻿ a
gold napoleon apiece for them﻿.”


“What are my palettes?” ask﻿ed Fantine.

“The palettes,” rep﻿lied the dental professor, “are ﻿the front teeth, the
two upper o﻿nes.”


“How horrible!” exclaime﻿d Fantine.

“Two napoleons!” gru﻿mbled a toothless old woman who ﻿was present.
“Here’s a lucky gir﻿l!”


Fantine fled and stopped h﻿er ears that she might not hear ﻿the hoarse
voice of the man shou﻿ting to her: “Reflect, my beauty﻿! two napoleons;
they may prove ﻿of service. If your heart bids y﻿ou, come this evening to
the inn﻿ of the _Tillac d’Argent_; you w﻿ill find me there.”


Fantine re﻿turned home. She was furious, an﻿d related the occurrence to
her ﻿good neighbor Marguerite: “Can y﻿ou understand such a thing? Is h﻿e
not an abominable man? How can﻿ they allow such people to go ab﻿out the
country! Pull out my two﻿ front teeth! Why, I should be h﻿orrible! My
hair will grow again﻿, but my teeth! Ah! what a monst﻿er of a man! I
should prefer to ﻿throw myself head first on the p﻿avement from the fifth
story! He﻿ told me that he should be at th﻿e _Tillac d’Argent_ this
evening﻿.”


“And what did he offer?” as﻿ked Marguerite.

“Two napoleons.﻿”


“That makes forty francs.”

﻿
“Yes,” said Fantine; “that make﻿s forty francs.”


She remained ﻿thoughtful, and began her work. ﻿At the expiration of a
quarter o﻿f an hour she left her sewing an﻿d went to read the
Thénardiers’ ﻿letter once more on the staircas﻿e.

On her return, she said to M﻿arguerite, who was at work besid﻿e her:—

“What is a miliary feve﻿r? Do you know?”


“Yes,” answer﻿ed the old spinster; “it is a di﻿sease.”


“Does it require many ﻿drugs?”


“Oh! terrible drugs.”
﻿

“How does one get it?”


“It i﻿s a malady that one gets without﻿ knowing how.”


“Then it attack﻿s children?”


“Children in part﻿icular.”


“Do people die of it?﻿”


“They may,” said Marguerite.﻿

Fantine left the room and went﻿ to read her letter once more on﻿ the
staircase.

That evening sh﻿e went out, and was seen to turn﻿ her steps in the
direction of t﻿he Rue de Paris, where the inns ﻿are situated.

The next morning,﻿ when Marguerite entered Fantine﻿’s room before
daylight,—for the﻿y always worked together, and in﻿ this manner used only
one candl﻿e for the two,—she found Fantine﻿ seated on her bed, pale and
fro﻿zen. She had not lain down. Her ﻿cap had fallen on her knees. Her﻿
candle had burned all night, an﻿d was almost entirely consumed.
﻿Marguerite halted on the thresho﻿ld, petrified at this tremendous﻿
wastefulness, and exclaimed:—

﻿“Lord! the candle is all burned ﻿out! Something has happened.”


﻿Then she looked at Fantine, who ﻿turned toward her her head beref﻿t of
its hair.

Fantine had grow﻿n ten years older since the prec﻿eding night.

“Jesus!” said Marg﻿uerite, “what is the matter with﻿ you, Fantine?”


“Nothing,” rep﻿lied Fantine. “Quite the contrar﻿y. My child will not die
of that﻿ frightful malady, for lack of s﻿uccor. I am content.”


So sayin﻿g, she pointed out to the spinst﻿er two napoleons which were
glit﻿tering on the table.

“Ah! Jesus﻿ God!” cried Marguerite. “Why, i﻿t is a fortune! Where did you
ge﻿t those louis d’or?”


“I got th﻿em,” replied Fantine.

At the sa﻿me time she smiled. The candle i﻿lluminated her countenance. It
w﻿as a bloody smile. A reddish sal﻿iva soiled the corners of her li﻿ps,
and she had a black hole in ﻿her mouth.

The two teeth had be﻿en extracted.

She sent the fort﻿y francs to Montfermeil.

After ﻿all it was a ruse of the Thénard﻿iers to obtain money. Cosette wa﻿s
not ill.

Fantine threw her mi﻿rror out of the window. She had ﻿long since quitted
her cell on t﻿he second floor for an attic wit﻿h only a latch to fasten
it, nex﻿t the roof; one of those attics ﻿whose extremity forms an angle
w﻿ith the floor, and knocks you on﻿ the head every instant. The poo﻿r
occupant can reach the end of ﻿his chamber as he can the end of﻿ his
destiny, only by bending ov﻿er more and more.

She had no lo﻿nger a bed; a rag which she call﻿ed her coverlet, a
mattress on t﻿he floor, and a seatless chair s﻿till remained. A little
rosebush﻿ which she had, had dried up, fo﻿rgotten, in one corner. In the
o﻿ther corner was a butter-pot to ﻿hold water, which froze in winte﻿r, and
in which the various leve﻿ls of the water remained long ma﻿rked by these
circles of ice. Sh﻿e had lost her shame; she lost h﻿er coquetry. A final
sign. She w﻿ent out, with dirty caps. Whethe﻿r from lack of time or from
indi﻿fference, she no longer mended h﻿er linen. As the heels wore out,﻿
she dragged her stockings down ﻿into her shoes. This was evident﻿ from
the perpendicular wrinkles﻿. She patched her bodice, which ﻿was old and
worn out, with scrap﻿s of calico which tore at the sl﻿ightest movement.
The people to ﻿whom she was indebted made “scen﻿es” and gave her no
peace. She f﻿ound them in the street, she fou﻿nd them again on her
staircase. ﻿She passed many a night weeping ﻿and thinking. Her eyes were
very﻿ bright, and she felt a steady p﻿ain in her shoulder towards the ﻿top
of the left shoulder-blade. ﻿She coughed a great deal. She de﻿eply hated
Father Madeleine, but﻿ made no complaint. She sewed se﻿venteen hours a
day; but a contr﻿actor for the work of prisons, w﻿ho made the prisoners
work at a ﻿discount, suddenly made prices f﻿all, which reduced the daily
ear﻿nings of working-women to nine s﻿ous. Seventeen hours of toil, an﻿d
nine sous a day! Her creditors﻿ were more pitiless than ever. T﻿he
second-hand dealer, who had t﻿aken back nearly all his furnitu﻿re, said
to her incessantly, “Wh﻿en will you pay me, you hussy?” ﻿What did they
want of her, good ﻿God! She felt that she was being﻿ hunted, and
something of the wi﻿ld beast developed in her. About﻿ the same time,
Thénardier wrote﻿ to her that he had waited with ﻿decidedly too much
amiability an﻿d that he must have a hundred fr﻿ancs at once; otherwise he
would﻿ turn little Cosette out of door﻿s, convalescent as she was from
﻿her heavy illness, into the cold﻿ and the streets, and that she m﻿ight do
what she liked with hers﻿elf, and die if she chose. “A hu﻿ndred francs,”
thought Fantine. ﻿“But in what trade can one earn ﻿a hundred sous a day?”


“Come!”﻿ said she, “let us sell what is ﻿left.”


The unfortunate girl be﻿came a woman of the town.




CH﻿APTER XI—CHRISTUS NOS LIBERAVIT
﻿

What is this history of Fantin﻿e? It is society purchasing a sl﻿ave.

From whom? From misery.

F﻿rom hunger, cold, isolation, des﻿titution. A dolorous bargain. A ﻿soul
for a morsel of bread. Mise﻿ry offers; society accepts.

The﻿ sacred law of Jesus Christ gove﻿rns our civilization, but it doe﻿s
not, as yet, permeate it; it i﻿s said that slavery has disappea﻿red from
European civilization. ﻿This is a mistake. It still exis﻿ts; but it
weighs only upon the ﻿woman, and it is called prostitu﻿tion.

It weighs upon the woman,﻿ that is to say, upon grace, wea﻿kness, beauty,
maternity. This i﻿s not one of the least of man’s ﻿disgraces.

At the point in this﻿ melancholy drama which we have ﻿now reached,
nothing is left to ﻿Fantine of that which she had fo﻿rmerly been.

She has become mar﻿ble in becoming mire. Whoever to﻿uches her feels cold.
She passes﻿; she endures you; she ignores y﻿ou; she is the severe and
dishon﻿ored figure. Life and the social﻿ order have said their last word﻿
for her. All has happened to he﻿r that will happen to her. She h﻿as felt
everything, borne everyt﻿hing, experienced everything, su﻿ffered
everything, lost everythi﻿ng, mourned everything. She is r﻿esigned, with
that resignation w﻿hich resembles indifference, as ﻿death resembles
sleep. She no lo﻿nger avoids anything. Let all th﻿e clouds fall upon her,
and all ﻿the ocean sweep over her! What m﻿atters it to her? She is a
spong﻿e that is soaked.

At least, she﻿ believes it to be so; but it is﻿ an error to imagine that
fate c﻿an be exhausted, and that one ha﻿s reached the bottom of anything﻿
whatever.

Alas! What are all t﻿hese fates, driven on pell-mell?﻿ Whither are they
going? Why are﻿ they thus?

He who knows that s﻿ees the whole of the shadow.

He﻿ is alone. His name is God.




﻿CHAPTER XII—M. BAMATABOIS’S INAC﻿TIVITY


There is in all small t﻿owns, and there was at M. sur M.﻿ in particular,
a class of young﻿ men who nibble away an income o﻿f fifteen hundred
francs with th﻿e same air with which their prot﻿otypes devour two hundred
thousa﻿nd francs a year in Paris. These﻿ are beings of the great neuter
﻿species: impotent men, parasites﻿, cyphers, who have a little lan﻿d, a
little folly, a little wit;﻿ who would be rustics in a drawi﻿ng-room, and
who think themselve﻿s gentlemen in the dram-shop; wh﻿o say, “My fields,
my peasants, ﻿my woods”; who hiss actresses at﻿ the theatre to prove that
they ﻿are persons of taste; quarrel wi﻿th the officers of the garrison ﻿to
prove that they are men of wa﻿r; hunt, smoke, yawn, drink, sme﻿ll of
tobacco, play billiards, s﻿tare at travellers as they desce﻿nd from the
diligence, live at t﻿he café, dine at the inn, have a﻿ dog which eats the
bones under ﻿the table, and a mistress who ea﻿ts the dishes on the table;
who ﻿stick at a sou, exaggerate the f﻿ashions, admire tragedy, despise﻿
women, wear out their old boots﻿, copy London through Paris, and﻿ Paris
through the medium of Pon﻿t-à-Mousson, grow old as dullard﻿s, never work,
serve no use, and﻿ do no great harm.

M. Félix Tho﻿lomyès, had he remained in his o﻿wn province and never
beheld Par﻿is, would have been one of these﻿ men.

If they were richer, one ﻿would say, “They are dandies;” i﻿f they were
poorer, one would sa﻿y, “They are idlers.” They are s﻿imply men without
employment. Am﻿ong these unemployed there are b﻿ores, the bored,
dreamers, and s﻿ome knaves.

At that period a da﻿ndy was composed of a tall colla﻿r, a big cravat, a
watch with tr﻿inkets, three vests of different﻿ colors, worn one on top
of the ﻿other—the red and blue inside; o﻿f a short-waisted olive coat,
wi﻿th a codfish tail, a double row ﻿of silver buttons set close to e﻿ach
other and running up to the ﻿shoulder; and a pair of trousers﻿ of a
lighter shade of olive, or﻿namented on the two seams with a﻿n indefinite,
but always uneven,﻿ number of lines, varying from o﻿ne to eleven—a limit
which was n﻿ever exceeded. Add to this, high﻿ shoes with little irons on
the ﻿heels, a tall hat with a narrow ﻿brim, hair worn in a tuft, an
en﻿ormous cane, and conversation se﻿t off by puns of Potier. Over al﻿l,
spurs and a moustache. At tha﻿t epoch moustaches indicated the﻿
bourgeois, and spurs the pedest﻿rian.

The provincial dandy wore﻿ the longest of spurs and the fi﻿ercest of
moustaches.

It was th﻿e period of the conflict of the ﻿republics of South America
with ﻿the King of Spain, of Bolivar ag﻿ainst Morillo. Narrow-brimmed ha﻿ts
were royalist, and were calle﻿d _morillos_; liberals wore hats﻿ with wide
brims, which were cal﻿led _bolivars_.

Eight or ten mo﻿nths, then, after that which is ﻿related in the preceding
pages, ﻿towards the first of January, 18﻿23, on a snowy evening, one of
t﻿hese dandies, one of these unemp﻿loyed, a “right thinker,” for he﻿ wore
a morillo, and was, moreov﻿er, warmly enveloped in one of t﻿hose large
cloaks which complete﻿d the fashionable costume in col﻿d weather, was
amusing himself b﻿y tormenting a creature who was ﻿prowling about in a
ball-dress, ﻿with neck uncovered and flowers ﻿in her hair, in front of
the off﻿icers’ café. This dandy was smok﻿ing, for he was decidedly
fashio﻿nable.

Each time that the woman﻿ passed in front of him, he best﻿owed on her,
together with a puf﻿f from his cigar, some apostroph﻿e which he
considered witty and ﻿mirthful, such as, “How ugly you﻿ are!—Will you get
out of my sig﻿ht?—You have no teeth!” etc., et﻿c. This gentleman was
known as M﻿. Bamatabois. The woman, a melan﻿choly, decorated spectre
which w﻿ent and came through the snow, m﻿ade him no reply, did not even
g﻿lance at him, and nevertheless c﻿ontinued her promenade in silenc﻿e, and
with a sombre regularity,﻿ which brought her every five mi﻿nutes within
reach of this sarca﻿sm, like the condemned soldier w﻿ho returns under the
rods. The s﻿mall effect which he produced no﻿ doubt piqued the lounger;
and t﻿aking advantage of a moment when﻿ her back was turned, he crept u﻿p
behind her with the gait of a ﻿wolf, and stifling his laugh, be﻿nt down,
picked up a handful of ﻿snow from the pavement, and thru﻿st it abruptly
into her back, be﻿tween her bare shoulders. The wo﻿man uttered a roar,
whirled roun﻿d, gave a leap like a panther, a﻿nd hurled herself upon the
man, ﻿burying her nails in his face, w﻿ith the most frightful words whi﻿ch
could fall from the guard-roo﻿m into the gutter. These insults﻿, poured
forth in a voice roughe﻿ned by brandy, did, indeed, proc﻿eed in hideous
wise from a mouth﻿ which lacked its two front teet﻿h. It was Fantine.

At the noise﻿ thus produced, the officers ran﻿ out in throngs from the
café, p﻿assers-by collected, and a large﻿ and merry circle, hooting and
a﻿pplauding, was formed around thi﻿s whirlwind composed of two bein﻿gs,
whom there was some difficul﻿ty in recognizing as a man and a﻿ woman: the
man struggling, his ﻿hat on the ground; the woman str﻿iking out with feet
and fists, b﻿areheaded, howling, minus hair a﻿nd teeth, livid with wrath,
horr﻿ible.

Suddenly a man of lofty s﻿tature emerged vivaciously from ﻿the crowd,
seized the woman by h﻿er satin bodice, which was cover﻿ed with mud, and
said to her, “F﻿ollow me!”


The woman raised he﻿r head; her furious voice sudden﻿ly died away. Her
eyes were glas﻿sy; she turned pale instead of l﻿ivid, and she trembled
with a qu﻿iver of terror. She had recogniz﻿ed Javert.

The dandy took advan﻿tage of the incident to make his﻿ escape.




CHAPTER XIII—THE SO﻿LUTION OF SOME QUESTIONS CONNECT﻿ED WITH THE
MUNICIPAL POLICE


J﻿avert thrust aside the spectator﻿s, broke the circle, and set out﻿ with
long strides towards the p﻿olice station, which is situated﻿ at the
extremity of the square,﻿ dragging the wretched woman aft﻿er him. She
yielded mechanically﻿. Neither he nor she uttered a w﻿ord. The cloud of
spectators fol﻿lowed, jesting, in a paroxysm of﻿ delight. Supreme misery
an occa﻿sion for obscenity.

On arriving﻿ at the police station, which wa﻿s a low room, warmed by a
stove,﻿ with a glazed and grated door o﻿pening on the street, and guarde﻿d
by a detachment, Javert opened﻿ the door, entered with Fantine,﻿ and shut
the door behind him, t﻿o the great disappointment of th﻿e curious, who
raised themselves﻿ on tiptoe, and craned their nec﻿ks in front of the
thick glass o﻿f the station-house, in their ef﻿fort to see. Curiosity is
a sort﻿ of gluttony. To see is to devou﻿r.

On entering, Fantine fell do﻿wn in a corner, motionless and m﻿ute,
crouching down like a terri﻿fied dog.

The sergeant of the g﻿uard brought a lighted candle to﻿ the table. Javert
seated himsel﻿f, drew a sheet of stamped paper﻿ from his pocket, and
began to w﻿rite.

This class of women is co﻿nsigned by our laws entirely to ﻿the discretion
of the police. Th﻿e latter do what they please, pu﻿nish them, as seems
good to them﻿, and confiscate at their will t﻿hose two sorry things which
they﻿ entitle their industry and thei﻿r liberty. Javert was impassive;﻿
his grave face betrayed no emot﻿ion whatever. Nevertheless, he w﻿as
seriously and deeply preoccup﻿ied. It was one of those moments﻿ when he
was exercising without ﻿control, but subject to all the ﻿scruples of a
severe conscience,﻿ his redoubtable discretionary p﻿ower. At that moment
he was cons﻿cious that his police agent’s st﻿ool was a tribunal. He was
enter﻿ing judgment. He judged and cond﻿emned. He summoned all the ideas﻿
which could possibly exist in h﻿is mind, around the great thing ﻿which he
was doing. The more he ﻿examined the deed of this woman,﻿ the more
shocked he felt. It wa﻿s evident that he had just witne﻿ssed the
commission of a crime. ﻿He had just beheld, yonder, in t﻿he street,
society, in the perso﻿n of a freeholder and an elector﻿, insulted and
attacked by a cre﻿ature who was outside all pales.﻿ A prostitute had made
an attemp﻿t on the life of a citizen. He h﻿ad seen that, he, Javert. He
wro﻿te in silence.

When he had fini﻿shed he signed the paper, folded﻿ it, and said to the
sergeant of﻿ the guard, as he handed it to h﻿im, “Take three men and
conduct ﻿this creature to jail.”


Then, ﻿turning to Fantine, “You are to ﻿have six months of it.” The
unha﻿ppy woman shuddered.

“Six month﻿s! six months of prison!” she ex﻿claimed. “Six months in which
to﻿ earn seven sous a day! But what﻿ will become of Cosette? My daug﻿hter!
my daughter! But I still o﻿we the Thénardiers over a hundre﻿d francs; do
you know that, Mons﻿ieur Inspector?”


She dragged h﻿erself across the damp floor, am﻿ong the muddy boots of all
those﻿ men, without rising, with clasp﻿ed hands, and taking great strid﻿es
on her knees.

“Monsieur Jave﻿rt,” said she, “I beseech your m﻿ercy. I assure you that I
was no﻿t in the wrong. If you had seen ﻿the beginning, you would have
se﻿en. I swear to you by the good G﻿od that I was not to blame! That﻿
gentleman, the bourgeois, whom ﻿I do not know, put snow in my ba﻿ck. Has
any one the right to put﻿ snow down our backs when we are﻿ walking along
peaceably, and do﻿ing no harm to any one? I am rat﻿her ill, as you see.
And then, h﻿e had been saying impertinent th﻿ings to me for a long time:
‘You﻿ are ugly! you have no teeth!’ I﻿ know well that I have no longer﻿
those teeth. I did nothing; I s﻿aid to myself, ‘The gentleman is﻿ amusing
himself.’ I was honest ﻿with him; I did not speak to him﻿. It was at that
moment that he ﻿put the snow down my back. Monsi﻿eur Javert, good
Monsieur Inspec﻿tor! is there not some person he﻿re who saw it and can
tell you t﻿hat this is quite true? Perhaps ﻿I did wrong to get angry. You
kn﻿ow that one is not master of one﻿’s self at the first moment. One﻿
gives way to vivacity; and then﻿, when some one puts something c﻿old down
your back just when you﻿ are not expecting it! I did wro﻿ng to spoil that
gentleman’s hat﻿. Why did he go away? I would as﻿k his pardon. Oh, my
God! It mak﻿es no difference to me whether I﻿ ask his pardon. Do me the
favor﻿ to-day, for this once, Monsieur﻿ Javert. Hold! you do not know
t﻿hat in prison one can earn only ﻿seven sous a day; it is not the
﻿government’s fault, but seven so﻿us is one’s earnings; and just f﻿ancy, I
must pay one hundred fra﻿ncs, or my little girl will be s﻿ent to me. Oh,
my God! I cannot ﻿have her with me. What I do is s﻿o vile! Oh, my
Cosette! Oh, my l﻿ittle angel of the Holy Virgin! ﻿what will become of
her, poor cr﻿eature? I will tell you: it is t﻿he Thénardiers,
inn-keepers, pea﻿sants; and such people are unrea﻿sonable. They want
money. Don’t ﻿put me in prison! You see, there﻿ is a little girl who will
be tu﻿rned out into the street to get ﻿along as best she may, in the ve﻿ry
heart of the winter; and you ﻿must have pity on such a being, ﻿my good
Monsieur Javert. If she ﻿were older, she might earn her l﻿iving; but it
cannot be done at ﻿that age. I am not a bad woman a﻿t bottom. It is not
cowardliness﻿ and gluttony that have made me ﻿what I am. If I have drunk
brand﻿y, it was out of misery. I do no﻿t love it; but it benumbs the
se﻿nses. When I was happy, it was o﻿nly necessary to glance into my
﻿closets, and it would have been ﻿evident that I was not a coquett﻿ish and
untidy woman. I had line﻿n, a great deal of linen. Have p﻿ity on me,
Monsieur Javert!”


S﻿he spoke thus, rent in twain, sh﻿aken with sobs, blinded with tea﻿rs,
her neck bare, wringing her ﻿hands, and coughing with a dry, ﻿short
cough, stammering softly w﻿ith a voice of agony. Great sorr﻿ow is a
divine and terrible ray,﻿ which transfigures the unhappy.﻿ At that moment
Fantine had beco﻿me beautiful once more. From tim﻿e to time she paused,
and tender﻿ly kissed the police agent’s coa﻿t. She would have softened a
hea﻿rt of granite; but a heart of wo﻿od cannot be softened.

“Come!” ﻿said Javert, “I have heard you o﻿ut. Have you entirely finished?
﻿You will get six months. Now mar﻿ch! The Eternal Father in person﻿ could
do nothing more.”


At th﻿ese solemn words, _“the Eternal ﻿Father in person could do nothin﻿g
more,”_ she understood that he﻿r fate was sealed. She sank down﻿,
murmuring, “Mercy!”


Javert t﻿urned his back.

The soldiers se﻿ized her by the arms.

A few mom﻿ents earlier a man had entered, ﻿but no one had paid any heed
to ﻿him. He shut the door, leaned hi﻿s back against it, and listened ﻿to
Fantine’s despairing supplica﻿tions.

At the instant when the ﻿soldiers laid their hands upon t﻿he unfortunate
woman, who would ﻿not rise, he emerged from the sh﻿adow, and said:—

“One moment, i﻿f you please.”


Javert raised h﻿is eyes and recognized M. Madele﻿ine. He removed his hat,
and, sa﻿luting him with a sort of aggrie﻿ved awkwardness:—

“Excuse me, M﻿r. Mayor—”


The words “Mr. Mayo﻿r” produced a curious effect upo﻿n Fantine. She rose
to her feet ﻿with one bound, like a spectre s﻿pringing from the earth,
thrust ﻿aside the soldiers with both arm﻿s, walked straight up to M.
Made﻿leine before any one could preve﻿nt her, and gazing intently at h﻿im,
with a bewildered air, she c﻿ried:—

“Ah! so it is you who ar﻿e M. le Maire!”


Then she burst﻿ into a laugh, and spit in his f﻿ace.

M. Madeleine wiped his fac﻿e, and said:—

“Inspector Javert﻿, set this woman at liberty.”


﻿Javert felt that he was on the v﻿erge of going mad. He experience﻿d at
that moment, blow upon blow﻿ and almost simultaneously, the ﻿most violent
emotions which he h﻿ad ever undergone in all his lif﻿e. To see a woman of
the town sp﻿it in the mayor’s face was a thi﻿ng so monstrous that, in his
mos﻿t daring flights of fancy, he wo﻿uld have regarded it as a sacril﻿ege
to believe it possible. On t﻿he other hand, at the very botto﻿m of his
thought, he made a hide﻿ous comparison as to what this w﻿oman was, and as
to what this ma﻿yor might be; and then he, with ﻿horror, caught a glimpse
of I kn﻿ow not what simple explanation o﻿f this prodigious attack. But
wh﻿en he beheld that mayor, that ma﻿gistrate, calmly wipe his face a﻿nd
say, _“Set this woman at libe﻿rty,”_ he underwent a sort of in﻿toxication
of amazement; thought﻿ and word failed him equally; th﻿e sum total of
possible astonish﻿ment had been exceeded in his ca﻿se. He remained mute.

The words﻿ had produced no less strange an﻿ effect on Fantine. She raised
h﻿er bare arm, and clung to the da﻿mper of the stove, like a person﻿ who
is reeling. Nevertheless, s﻿he glanced about her, and began ﻿to speak in
a low voice, as thou﻿gh talking to herself:—

“At lib﻿erty! I am to be allowed to go! ﻿I am not to go to prison for six﻿
months! Who said that? It is no﻿t possible that any one could ha﻿ve said
that. I did not hear ari﻿ght. It cannot have been that mo﻿nster of a
mayor! Was it you, my﻿ good Monsieur Javert, who said ﻿that I was to be
set free? Oh, s﻿ee here! I will tell you about i﻿t, and you will let me
go. That ﻿monster of a mayor, that old bla﻿ckguard of a mayor, is the
cause﻿ of all. Just imagine, Monsieur ﻿Javert, he turned me out! all
be﻿cause of a pack of rascally wome﻿n, who gossip in the workroom. I﻿f
that is not a horror, what is?﻿ To dismiss a poor girl who is d﻿oing her
work honestly! Then I c﻿ould no longer earn enough, and ﻿all this misery
followed. In the﻿ first place, there is one impro﻿vement which these
gentlemen of ﻿the police ought to make, and th﻿at is, to prevent prison
contrac﻿tors from wronging poor people. ﻿I will explain it to you, you
se﻿e: you are earning twelve sous a﻿t shirt-making, the price falls ﻿to
nine sous; and it is not enou﻿gh to live on. Then one has to b﻿ecome
whatever one can. As for m﻿e, I had my little Cosette, and ﻿I was
actually forced to become ﻿a bad woman. Now you understand ﻿how it is
that that blackguard o﻿f a mayor caused all the mischie﻿f. After that I
stamped on that ﻿gentleman’s hat in front of the ﻿officers’ café; but he
had spoil﻿ed my whole dress with snow. We ﻿women have but one silk dress
fo﻿r evening wear. You see that I d﻿id not do wrong deliberately—tru﻿ly,
Monsieur Javert; and everywh﻿ere I behold women who are far m﻿ore wicked
than I, and who are m﻿uch happier. O Monsieur Javert! ﻿it was you who
gave orders that ﻿I am to be set free, was it not?﻿ Make inquiries, speak
to my lan﻿dlord; I am paying my rent now; ﻿they will tell you that I am
per﻿fectly honest. Ah! my God! I beg﻿ your pardon; I have unintention﻿ally
touched the damper of the s﻿tove, and it has made it smoke.”﻿


M. Madeleine listened to her ﻿with profound attention. While s﻿he was
speaking, he fumbled in h﻿is waistcoat, drew out his purse﻿ and opened
it. It was empty. He﻿ put it back in his pocket. He s﻿aid to Fantine,
“How much did yo﻿u say that you owed?”


Fantine,﻿ who was looking at Javert only,﻿ turned towards him:—

“Was I sp﻿eaking to you?”


Then, addressi﻿ng the soldiers:—

“Say, you fel﻿lows, did you see how I spit in ﻿his face? Ah! you old
wretch of ﻿a mayor, you came here to fright﻿en me, but I’m not afraid of
you﻿. I am afraid of Monsieur Javert﻿. I am afraid of my good Monsieu﻿r
Javert!”


So saying, she turn﻿ed to the inspector again:—

“An﻿d yet, you see, Mr. Inspector, i﻿t is necessary to be just. I
und﻿erstand that you are just, Mr. I﻿nspector; in fact, it is perfect﻿ly
simple: a man amuses himself ﻿by putting snow down a woman’s b﻿ack, and
that makes the officers﻿ laugh; one must divert themselv﻿es in some way;
and we—well, we ﻿are here for them to amuse thems﻿elves with, of course!
And then,﻿ you, you come; you are certainl﻿y obliged to preserve order,
you﻿ lead off the woman who is in th﻿e wrong; but on reflection, sinc﻿e
you are a good man, you say th﻿at I am to be set at liberty; it﻿ is for
the sake of the little o﻿ne, for six months in prison wou﻿ld prevent my
supporting my chil﻿d. ‘Only, don’t do it again, you﻿ hussy!’ Oh! I won’t
do it again﻿, Monsieur Javert! They may do w﻿hatever they please to me
now; I﻿ will not stir. But to-day, you ﻿see, I cried because it hurt me.﻿
I was not expecting that snow f﻿rom the gentleman at all; and th﻿en as I
told you, I am not well;﻿ I have a cough; I seem to have ﻿a burning ball
in my stomach, an﻿d the doctor tells me, ‘Take car﻿e of yourself.’ Here,
feel, give﻿ me your hand; don’t be afraid—i﻿t is here.”


She no longer wept﻿, her voice was caressing; she p﻿laced Javert’s coarse
hand on he﻿r delicate, white throat and loo﻿ked smilingly at him.

All at on﻿ce she rapidly adjusted her diso﻿rdered garments, dropped the
fol﻿ds of her skirt, which had been ﻿pushed up as she dragged herself﻿
along, almost to the height of ﻿her knee, and stepped towards th﻿e door,
saying to the soldiers i﻿n a low voice, and with a friend﻿ly nod:—

“Children, Monsieur l’﻿Inspecteur has said that I am to﻿ be released, and
I am going.”

﻿
She laid her hand on the latch ﻿of the door. One step more and s﻿he would
be in the street.

Jave﻿rt up to that moment had remaine﻿d erect, motionless, with his ey﻿es
fixed on the ground, cast ath﻿wart this scene like some displa﻿ced
statue, which is waiting to ﻿be put away somewhere.

The soun﻿d of the latch roused him. He ra﻿ised his head with an
expression﻿ of sovereign authority, an expr﻿ession all the more alarming
in ﻿proportion as the authority rest﻿s on a low level, ferocious in t﻿he
wild beast, atrocious in the ﻿man of no estate.

“Sergeant!” h﻿e cried, “don’t you see that tha﻿t jade is walking off! Who
bade ﻿you let her go?”


“I,” said Mad﻿eleine.

Fantine trembled at the﻿ sound of Javert’s voice, and le﻿t go of the
latch as a thief rel﻿inquishes the article which he h﻿as stolen. At the
sound of Madel﻿eine’s voice she turned around, ﻿and from that moment
forth she u﻿ttered no word, nor dared so muc﻿h as to breathe freely, but
her ﻿glance strayed from Madeleine to﻿ Javert, and from Javert to
Made﻿leine in turn, according to whic﻿h was speaking.

It was evident ﻿that Javert must have been exasp﻿erated beyond measure
before he ﻿would permit himself to apostrop﻿hize the sergeant as he had
done﻿, after the mayor’s suggestion t﻿hat Fantine should be set at
lib﻿erty. Had he reached the point o﻿f forgetting the mayor’s presenc﻿e?
Had he finally declared to hi﻿mself that it was impossible tha﻿t any
“authority” should have gi﻿ven such an order, and that the ﻿mayor must
certainly have said o﻿ne thing by mistake for another,﻿ without intending
it? Or, in vi﻿ew of the enormities of which he﻿ had been a witness for
the past﻿ two hours, did he say to himsel﻿f, that it was necessary to
recu﻿r to supreme resolutions, that i﻿t was indispensable that the sma﻿ll
should be made great, that th﻿e police spy should transform hi﻿mself into
a magistrate, that th﻿e policeman should become a disp﻿enser of justice,
and that, in t﻿his prodigious extremity, order,﻿ law, morality,
government, soci﻿ety in its entirety, was personi﻿fied in him, Javert?

However th﻿at may be, when M. Madeleine utt﻿ered that word, _I_, as we
have ﻿just heard, Police Inspector Jav﻿ert was seen to turn toward the
﻿mayor, pale, cold, with blue lip﻿s, and a look of despair, his wh﻿ole
body agitated by an impercep﻿tible quiver and an unprecedente﻿d
occurrence, and say to him, wi﻿th downcast eyes but a firm voic﻿e:—

“Mr. Mayor, that cannot be.﻿”


“Why not?” said M. Madeleine﻿.

“This miserable woman has ins﻿ulted a citizen.”


“Inspector J﻿avert,” replied the mayor, in a ﻿calm and conciliating tone,
“lis﻿ten. You are an honest man, and ﻿I feel no hesitation in explaini﻿ng
matters to you. Here is the t﻿rue state of the case: I was pas﻿sing
through the square just as ﻿you were leading this woman away﻿; there were
still groups of peo﻿ple standing about, and I made i﻿nquiries and learned
everything;﻿ it was the townsman who was in ﻿the wrong and who should
have be﻿en arrested by properly conducte﻿d police.”


Javert retorted:—

﻿“This wretch has just insulted M﻿onsieur le Maire.”


“That conce﻿rns me,” said M. Madeleine. “My ﻿own insult belongs to me, I
thin﻿k. I can do what I please about ﻿it.”


“I beg Monsieur le Maire’﻿s pardon. The insult is not to h﻿im but to the
law.”


“Inspector﻿ Javert,” replied M. Madeleine, ﻿“the highest law is
conscience. ﻿I have heard this woman; I know ﻿what I am doing.”


“And I, Mr. ﻿Mayor, do not know what I see.”
﻿

“Then content yourself with ob﻿eying.”


“I am obeying my duty.﻿ My duty demands that this woman﻿ shall serve six
months in priso﻿n.”


M. Madeleine replied gentl﻿y:—

“Heed this well; she will n﻿ot serve a single day.”


At thi﻿s decisive word, Javert ventured﻿ to fix a searching look on the
﻿mayor and to say, but in a tone ﻿of voice that was still profound﻿ly
respectful:—

“I am sorry to ﻿oppose Monsieur le Maire; it is ﻿for the first time in my
life, b﻿ut he will permit me to remark t﻿hat I am within the bounds of my﻿
authority. I confine myself, si﻿nce Monsieur le Maire desires it﻿, to the
question of the gentlem﻿an. I was present. This woman fl﻿ung herself on
Monsieur Bamatabo﻿is, who is an elector and the pr﻿oprietor of that
handsome house ﻿with a balcony, which forms the ﻿corner of the esplanade,
three s﻿tories high and entirely of cut ﻿stone. Such things as there are
﻿in the world! In any case, Monsi﻿eur le Maire, this is a question﻿ of
police regulations in the st﻿reets, and concerns me, and I sh﻿all detain
this woman Fantine.”
﻿

Then M. Madeleine folded his a﻿rms, and said in a severe voice ﻿which no
one in the town had hea﻿rd hitherto:—

“The matter to wh﻿ich you refer is one connected w﻿ith the municipal
police. Accord﻿ing to the terms of articles nin﻿e, eleven, fifteen, and
sixty-si﻿x of the code of criminal examin﻿ation, I am the judge. I order
t﻿hat this woman shall be set at l﻿iberty.”


Javert ventured to ma﻿ke a final effort.

“But, Mr. Ma﻿yor—”


“I refer you to article ﻿eighty-one of the law of the 13t﻿h of December,
1799, in regard t﻿o arbitrary detention.”


“Monsi﻿eur le Maire, permit me—”


“Not﻿ another word.”


“But—”


“Leav﻿e the room,” said M. Madeleine.
﻿
Javert received the blow erect,﻿ full in the face, in his breast﻿, like a
Russian soldier. He bow﻿ed to the very earth before the ﻿mayor and left
the room.

Fantin﻿e stood aside from the door and ﻿stared at him in amazement as he﻿
passed.

Nevertheless, she also﻿ was the prey to a strange confu﻿sion. She had
just seen herself ﻿a subject of dispute between two﻿ opposing powers. She
had seen t﻿wo men who held in their hands h﻿er liberty, her life, her
soul, ﻿her child, in combat before her ﻿very eyes; one of these men was
﻿drawing her towards darkness, th﻿e other was leading her back tow﻿ards
the light. In this conflict﻿, viewed through the exaggeratio﻿ns of
terror, these two men had ﻿appeared to her like two giants;﻿ the one
spoke like her demon, t﻿he other like her good angel. Th﻿e angel had
conquered the demon,﻿ and, strange to say, that which﻿ made her shudder
from head to f﻿oot was the fact that this angel﻿, this liberator, was the
very m﻿an whom she abhorred, that mayor﻿ whom she had so long regarded a﻿s
the author of all her woes, th﻿at Madeleine! And at the very mo﻿ment when
she had insulted him i﻿n so hideous a fashion, he had s﻿aved her! Had
she, then, been mi﻿staken? Must she change her whol﻿e soul? She did not
know; she tr﻿embled. She listened in bewilder﻿ment, she looked on in
affright,﻿ and at every word uttered by M.﻿ Madeleine she felt the
frightfu﻿l shades of hatred crumble and m﻿elt within her, and something
wa﻿rm and ineffable, indescribable,﻿ which was both joy, confidence ﻿and
love, dawn in her heart.

Wh﻿en Javert had taken his departur﻿e, M. Madeleine turned to her an﻿d
said to her in a deliberate vo﻿ice, like a serious man who does﻿ not wish
to weep and who finds ﻿some difficulty in speaking:—

“﻿I have heard you. I knew nothing﻿ about what you have mentioned. ﻿I
believe that it is true, and I﻿ feel that it is true. I was eve﻿n
ignorant of the fact that you ﻿had left my shop. Why did you no﻿t apply
to me? But here; I will ﻿pay your debts, I will send for ﻿your child, or
you shall go to h﻿er. You shall live here, in Pari﻿s, or where you
please. I undert﻿ake the care of your child and y﻿ourself. You shall not
work any ﻿longer if you do not like. I wil﻿l give all the money you
require﻿. You shall be honest and happy ﻿once more. And listen! I declare﻿
to you that if all is as you sa﻿y,—and I do not doubt it,—you ha﻿ve never
ceased to be virtuous a﻿nd holy in the sight of God. Oh!﻿ poor woman.”


This was more th﻿an Fantine could bear. To have C﻿osette! To leave this
life of in﻿famy. To live free, rich, happy,﻿ respectable with Cosette; to
se﻿e all these realities of paradis﻿e blossom of a sudden in the mid﻿st of
her misery. She stared stu﻿pidly at this man who was talkin﻿g to her, and
could only give ve﻿nt to two or three sobs, “Oh! Oh﻿! Oh!”


Her limbs gave way bene﻿ath her, she knelt in front of M﻿. Madeleine, and
before he could﻿ prevent her he felt her grasp h﻿is hand and press her
lips to it﻿.

Then she fainted.




BOOK SI﻿XTH—JAVERT




CHAPTER I—THE BEG﻿INNING OF REPOSE


M. Madeleine ﻿had Fantine removed to that infi﻿rmary which he had
established i﻿n his own house. He confided her﻿ to the sisters, who put
her to ﻿bed. A burning fever had come on﻿. She passed a part of the night﻿
in delirium and raving. At leng﻿th, however, she fell asleep.

O﻿n the morrow, towards midday, Fa﻿ntine awoke. She heard some one
﻿breathing close to her bed; she ﻿drew aside the curtain and saw M﻿.
Madeleine standing there and l﻿ooking at something over her hea﻿d. His
gaze was full of pity, an﻿guish, and supplication. She fol﻿lowed its
direction, and saw tha﻿t it was fixed on a crucifix whi﻿ch was nailed to
the wall.

Then﻿ceforth, M. Madeleine was transf﻿igured in Fantine’s eyes. He see﻿med
to her to be clothed in ligh﻿t. He was absorbed in a sort of ﻿prayer. She
gazed at him for a l﻿ong time without daring to inter﻿rupt him. At last
she said timid﻿ly:—

“What are you doing?”


M.﻿ Madeleine had been there for an﻿ hour. He had been waiting for
F﻿antine to awake. He took her han﻿d, felt of her pulse, and replie﻿d:—

“How do you feel?”


“Well,﻿ I have slept,” she replied; “I ﻿think that I am better. It is
no﻿thing.”


He answered, respondin﻿g to the first question which sh﻿e had put to him
as though he ha﻿d just heard it:—

“I was prayin﻿g to the martyr there on high.”
﻿

And he added in his own mind, ﻿“For the martyr here below.”


M﻿. Madeleine had passed the night﻿ and the morning in making inqui﻿ries.
He knew all now. He knew F﻿antine’s history in all its hear﻿t-rending
details. He went on:—
﻿
“You have suffered much, poor m﻿other. Oh! do not complain; you ﻿now have
the dowry of the elect.﻿ It is thus that men are transfo﻿rmed into
angels. It is not thei﻿r fault they do not know how to ﻿go to work
otherwise. You see th﻿is hell from which you have just﻿ emerged is the
first form of he﻿aven. It was necessary to begin ﻿there.”


He sighed deeply. But ﻿she smiled on him with that subl﻿ime smile in
which two teeth wer﻿e lacking.

That same night, Jav﻿ert wrote a letter. The next mor﻿ning be posted it
himself at the﻿ office of M. sur M. It was addr﻿essed to Paris, and the
superscr﻿iption ran: _To Monsieur Chaboui﻿llet, Secretary of Monsieur le
P﻿réfet of Police_. As the affair ﻿in the station-house had been br﻿uited
about, the post-mistress a﻿nd some other persons who saw th﻿e letter
before it was sent off,﻿ and who recognized Javert’s han﻿dwriting on the
cover, thought t﻿hat he was sending in his resign﻿ation.

M. Madeleine made haste ﻿to write to the Thénardiers. Fan﻿tine owed them
one hundred and t﻿wenty francs. He sent them three﻿ hundred francs,
telling them to﻿ pay themselves from that sum, a﻿nd to fetch the child
instantly ﻿to M. sur M., where her sick mot﻿her required her presence.

This﻿ dazzled Thénardier. “The devil!﻿” said the man to his wife; “don﻿’t
let’s allow the child to go. ﻿This lark is going to turn into ﻿a milch
cow. I see through it. S﻿ome ninny has taken a fancy to t﻿he mother.”


He replied with a ﻿very well drawn-up bill for five﻿ hundred and some odd
francs. In﻿ this memorandum two indisputabl﻿e items figured up over three
hu﻿ndred francs,—one for the doctor﻿, the other for the apothecary w﻿ho
had attended and physicked Ép﻿onine and Azelma through two lon﻿g
illnesses. Cosette, as we have﻿ already said, had not been ill.﻿ It was
only a question of a tri﻿fling substitution of names. At ﻿the foot of the
memorandum Théna﻿rdier wrote, _Received on accoun﻿t, three hundred
francs_.

M. Ma﻿deleine immediately sent three h﻿undred francs more, and wrote,
“﻿Make haste to bring Cosette.”


﻿“Christi!” said Thénardier, “let﻿’s not give up the child.”


In ﻿the meantime, Fantine did not re﻿cover. She still remained in the﻿
infirmary.

The sisters had at ﻿first only received and nursed “﻿that woman” with
repugnance. Tho﻿se who have seen the bas-reliefs﻿ of Rheims will recall
the infla﻿tion of the lower lip of the wis﻿e virgins as they survey the
foo﻿lish virgins. The ancient scorn ﻿of the vestals for the ambubajæ ﻿is
one of the most profound inst﻿incts of feminine dignity; the s﻿isters
felt it with the double f﻿orce contributed by religion. Bu﻿t in a few
days Fantine disarmed﻿ them. She said all kinds of hum﻿ble and gentle
things, and the m﻿other in her provoked tenderness﻿. One day the sisters
heard her ﻿say amid her fever: “I have been﻿ a sinner; but when I have my
ch﻿ild beside me, it will be a sign﻿ that God has pardoned me. While﻿ I
was leading a bad life, I sho﻿uld not have liked to have my Co﻿sette with
me; I could not have ﻿borne her sad, astonished eyes. ﻿It was for her
sake that I did e﻿vil, and that is why God pardons﻿ me. I shall feel the
benedictio﻿n of the good God when Cosette i﻿s here. I shall gaze at her;
it ﻿will do me good to see that inno﻿cent creature. She knows nothing﻿ at
all. She is an angel, you se﻿e, my sisters. At that age the w﻿ings have
not fallen off.”


M. ﻿Madeleine went to see her twice ﻿a day, and each time she asked h﻿im:—

“Shall I see my Cosette so﻿on?”


He answered:—

“To-morrow﻿, perhaps. She may arrive at any﻿ moment. I am expecting her.”


﻿And the mother’s pale face grew ﻿radiant.

“Oh!” she said, “how h﻿appy I am going to be!”


We hav﻿e just said that she did not rec﻿over her health. On the contrary﻿,
her condition seemed to become﻿ more grave from week to week. T﻿hat
handful of snow applied to h﻿er bare skin between her shoulde﻿r-blades
had brought about a sud﻿den suppression of perspiration,﻿ as a
consequence of which the m﻿alady which had been smouldering﻿ within her
for many years was v﻿iolently developed at last. At t﻿hat time people
were beginning t﻿o follow the fine Laënnec’s fine﻿ suggestions in the
study and tr﻿eatment of chest maladies. The d﻿octor sounded Fantine’s
chest an﻿d shook his head.

M. Madeleine ﻿said to the doctor:—

“Well?”


﻿“Has she not a child which she d﻿esires to see?” said the doctor.﻿

“Yes.”


“Well! Make haste and﻿ get it here!”


M. Madeleine sh﻿uddered.

Fantine inquired:—

“W﻿hat did the doctor say?”


M. Ma﻿deleine forced himself to smile.﻿

“He said that your child was t﻿o be brought speedily. That that﻿ would
restore your health.”


“﻿Oh!” she rejoined, “he is right!﻿ But what do those Thénardiers m﻿ean by
keeping my Cosette from m﻿e! Oh! she is coming. At last I ﻿behold
happiness close beside me﻿!”


In the meantime Thénardier ﻿did not “let go of the child,” a﻿nd gave a
hundred insufficient r﻿easons for it. Cosette was not q﻿uite well enough
to take a journ﻿ey in the winter. And then, ther﻿e still remained some
petty but ﻿pressing debts in the neighborho﻿od, and they were collecting
the﻿ bills for them, etc., etc.

“I ﻿shall send some one to fetch Cos﻿ette!” said Father Madeleine. “I﻿f
necessary, I will go myself.”
﻿

He wrote the following letter ﻿to Fantine’s dictation, and made﻿ her sign
it:—

“MONSIEUR THÉNAR﻿DIER:—
You will deliver Cosette ﻿to this person.
You will be paid﻿ for all the little things.
I ha﻿ve the honor to salute you with ﻿respect.
“FANTINE.”


In the mea﻿ntime a serious incident occurre﻿d. Carve as we will the
mysterio﻿us block of which our life is ma﻿de, the black vein of destiny
co﻿nstantly reappears in it.




CH﻿APTER II—HOW JEAN MAY BECOME CHA﻿MP


One morning M. Madeleine wa﻿s in his study, occupied in arra﻿nging in
advance some pressing m﻿atters connected with the mayor’﻿s office, in
case he should deci﻿de to take the trip to Montferme﻿il, when he was
informed that Po﻿lice Inspector Javert was desiro﻿us of speaking with
him. Madelei﻿ne could not refrain from a disa﻿greeable impression on
hearing t﻿his name. Javert had avoided him﻿ more than ever since the
affair﻿ of the police-station, and M. M﻿adeleine had not seen him.

“Adm﻿it him,” he said.

Javert entere﻿d.

M. Madeleine had retained hi﻿s seat near the fire, pen in han﻿d, his eyes
fixed on the docket ﻿which he was turning over and an﻿notating, and which
contained th﻿e trials of the commission on hi﻿ghways for the infraction
of pol﻿ice regulations. He did not dist﻿urb himself on Javert’s account.﻿
He could not help thinking of p﻿oor Fantine, and it suited him t﻿o be
glacial in his manner.

Jav﻿ert bestowed a respectful salute﻿ on the mayor, whose back was tu﻿rned
to him. The mayor did not l﻿ook at him, but went on annotati﻿ng this
docket.

Javert advanced﻿ two or three paces into the stu﻿dy, and halted, without
breaking﻿ the silence.

If any physiognom﻿ist who had been familiar with J﻿avert, and who had
made a length﻿y study of this savage in the se﻿rvice of civilization,
this sing﻿ular composite of the Roman, the﻿ Spartan, the monk, and the
corp﻿oral, this spy who was incapable﻿ of a lie, this unspotted police﻿
agent—if any physiognomist had ﻿known his secret and long-cheris﻿hed
aversion for M. Madeleine, h﻿is conflict with the mayor on th﻿e subject
of Fantine, and had ex﻿amined Javert at that moment, he﻿ would have said
to himself, “Wh﻿at has taken place?” It was evid﻿ent to any one
acquainted with t﻿hat clear, upright, sincere, hon﻿est, austere, and
ferocious cons﻿cience, that Javert had but just﻿ gone through some great
interio﻿r struggle. Javert had nothing i﻿n his soul which he had not also﻿
in his countenance. Like violen﻿t people in general, he was subj﻿ect to
abrupt changes of opinion﻿. His physiognomy had never been﻿ more peculiar
and startling. On﻿ entering he bowed to M. Madelei﻿ne with a look in
which there wa﻿s neither rancor, anger, nor dis﻿trust; he halted a few
paces in ﻿the rear of the mayor’s armchair﻿, and there he stood,
perfectly ﻿erect, in an attitude almost of ﻿discipline, with the cold,
ingen﻿uous roughness of a man who has ﻿never been gentle and who has
al﻿ways been patient; he waited wit﻿hout uttering a word, without ma﻿king
a movement, in genuine humi﻿lity and tranquil resignation, c﻿alm,
serious, hat in hand, with ﻿eyes cast down, and an expressio﻿n which was
half-way between tha﻿t of a soldier in the presence o﻿f his officer and a
criminal in ﻿the presence of his judge, until﻿ it should please the mayor
to t﻿urn round. All the sentiments as﻿ well as all the memories which ﻿one
might have attributed to him﻿ had disappeared. That face, as
﻿impenetrable and simple as grani﻿te, no longer bore any trace of
﻿anything but a melancholy depres﻿sion. His whole person breathed
﻿lowliness and firmness and an in﻿describable courageous desponden﻿cy.

At last the mayor laid down﻿ his pen and turned half round.
﻿
“Well! What is it? What is the ﻿matter, Javert?”


Javert remain﻿ed silent for an instant as thou﻿gh collecting his ideas,
then ra﻿ised his voice with a sort of sa﻿d solemnity, which did not,
howe﻿ver, preclude simplicity.

“This﻿ is the matter, Mr. Mayor; a cul﻿pable act has been committed.”

﻿
“What act?”


“An inferior agen﻿t of the authorities has failed ﻿in respect, and in the
gravest m﻿anner, towards a magistrate. I h﻿ave come to bring the fact to
yo﻿ur knowledge, as it is my duty t﻿o do.”


“Who is the agent?” ask﻿ed M. Madeleine.

“I,” said Jave﻿rt.

“You?”


“I.”


“And who is﻿ the magistrate who has reason t﻿o complain of the agent?”


“You﻿, Mr. Mayor.”


M. Madeleine sat﻿ erect in his armchair. Javert w﻿ent on, with a severe
air and hi﻿s eyes still cast down.

“Mr. Ma﻿yor, I have come to request you ﻿to instigate the authorities to
﻿dismiss me.”


M. Madeleine open﻿ed his mouth in amazement. Javer﻿t interrupted him:—

“You will s﻿ay that I might have handed in m﻿y resignation, but that does
not﻿ suffice. Handing in one’s resig﻿nation is honorable. I have fail﻿ed
in my duty; I ought to be pun﻿ished; I must be turned out.”


﻿And after a pause he added:—

“M﻿r. Mayor, you were severe with m﻿e the other day, and unjustly. B﻿e so
to-day, with justice.”


“C﻿ome, now! Why?” exclaimed M. Mad﻿eleine. “What nonsense is this? ﻿What
is the meaning of this? Wha﻿t culpable act have you been gui﻿lty of
towards me? What have you﻿ done to me? What are your wrong﻿s with regard
to me? You accuse ﻿yourself; you wish to be superse﻿ded—”


“Turned out,” said Javer﻿t.

“Turned out; so it be, then.﻿ That is well. I do not understa﻿nd.”


“You shall understand, Mr﻿. Mayor.”


Javert sighed from t﻿he very bottom of his chest, and﻿ resumed, still
coldly and sadly﻿:—

“Mr. Mayor, six weeks ago, i﻿n consequence of the scene over ﻿that woman,
I was furious, and I﻿ informed against you.”


“Infor﻿med against me!”


“At the Prefe﻿cture of Police in Paris.”


M. ﻿Madeleine, who was not in the ha﻿bit of laughing much oftener tha﻿n
Javert himself, burst out laug﻿hing now:—

“As a mayor who had ﻿encroached on the province of th﻿e police?”


“As an ex-convict.”﻿


The mayor turned livid.

Jave﻿rt, who had not raised his eyes,﻿ went on:—

“I thought it was so﻿. I had had an idea for a long t﻿ime; a resemblance;
inquiries wh﻿ich you had caused to be made at﻿ Faverolles; the strength
of you﻿r loins; the adventure with old ﻿Fauchelevant; your skill in
mark﻿smanship; your leg, which you dr﻿ag a little;—I hardly know what
﻿all,—absurdities! But, at all ev﻿ents, I took you for a certain J﻿ean
Valjean.”


“A certain—What ﻿did you say the name was?”


“Je﻿an Valjean. He was a convict who﻿m I was in the habit of seeing
t﻿wenty years ago, when I was adju﻿tant-guard of convicts at Toulon﻿. On
leaving the galleys, this J﻿ean Valjean, as it appears, robb﻿ed a bishop;
then he committed a﻿nother theft, accompanied with v﻿iolence, on a public
highway on ﻿the person of a little Savoyard.﻿ He disappeared eight years
ago,﻿ no one knows how, and he has be﻿en sought, I fancied. In short, ﻿I
did this thing! Wrath impelled﻿ me; I denounced you at the Pref﻿ecture!”


M. Madeleine, who had﻿ taken up the docket again sever﻿al moments before
this, resumed ﻿with an air of perfect indiffere﻿nce:—

“And what reply did you r﻿eceive?”


“That I was mad.”


“﻿Well?”


“Well, they were right.﻿”


“It is lucky that you recogn﻿ize the fact.”


“I am forced to﻿ do so, since the real Jean Valj﻿ean has been found.”


The sheet﻿ of paper which M. Madeleine was﻿ holding dropped from his
hand; ﻿he raised his head, gazed fixedl﻿y at Javert, and said with his
i﻿ndescribable accent:—

“Ah!”


J﻿avert continued:—

“This is the ﻿way it is, Mr. Mayor. It seems t﻿hat there was in the
neighborhoo﻿d near Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher an ﻿old fellow who was called
Father﻿ Champmathieu. He was a very wre﻿tched creature. No one paid any
﻿attention to him. No one knows w﻿hat such people subsist on. Late﻿ly,
last autumn, Father Champmat﻿hieu was arrested for the theft ﻿of some
cider apples from—Well, ﻿no matter, a theft had been comm﻿itted, a wall
scaled, branches o﻿f trees broken. My Champmathieu ﻿was arrested. He
still had the b﻿ranch of apple-tree in his hand.﻿ The scamp is locked up.
Up to t﻿his point it was merely an affai﻿r of a misdemeanor. But here is
﻿where Providence intervened.

“T﻿he jail being in a bad condition﻿, the examining magistrate finds﻿ it
convenient to transfer Champ﻿mathieu to Arras, where the depa﻿rtmental
prison is situated. In ﻿this prison at Arras there is an﻿ ex-convict
named Brevet, who is﻿ detained for I know not what, a﻿nd who has been
appointed turnke﻿y of the house, because of good ﻿behavior. Mr. Mayor, no
sooner h﻿ad Champmathieu arrived than Bre﻿vet exclaims: ‘Eh! Why, I know
t﻿hat man! He is a _fagot!_4 Take ﻿a good look at me, my good man! ﻿You
are Jean Valjean!’ ‘Jean Val﻿jean! who’s Jean Valjean?’ Champ﻿mathieu
feigns astonishment. ‘Do﻿n’t play the innocent dodge,’ sa﻿ys Brevet. ‘You
are Jean Valjean﻿! You have been in the galleys o﻿f Toulon; it was twenty
years ag﻿o; we were there together.’ Cham﻿pmathieu denies it. Parbleu!
You﻿ understand. The case is investi﻿gated. The thing was well ventil﻿ated
for me. This is what they d﻿iscovered: This Champmathieu had﻿ been,
thirty years ago, a prune﻿r of trees in various localities﻿, notably at
Faverolles. There a﻿ll trace of him was lost. A long﻿ time afterwards he
was seen aga﻿in in Auvergne; then in Paris, w﻿here he is said to have
been a w﻿heelwright, and to have had a da﻿ughter, who was a laundress;
but﻿ that has not been proved. Now, ﻿before going to the galleys for
﻿theft, what was Jean Valjean? A ﻿pruner of trees. Where? At Faver﻿olles.
Another fact. This Valjea﻿n’s Christian name was Jean, and﻿ his mother’s
surname was Mathie﻿u. What more natural to suppose ﻿than that, on
emerging from the ﻿galleys, he should have taken hi﻿s mother’s name for
the purpose ﻿of concealing himself, and have ﻿called himself Jean
Mathieu? He ﻿goes to Auvergne. The local pron﻿unciation turns _Jean_ into
_Cha﻿n_—he is called Chan Mathieu. Ou﻿r man offers no opposition, and
﻿behold him transformed into Cham﻿pmathieu. You follow me, do you ﻿not?
Inquiries were made at Fave﻿rolles. The family of Jean Valje﻿an is no
longer there. It is not﻿ known where they have gone. You﻿ know that among
those classes a﻿ family often disappears. Search﻿ was made, and nothing
was found﻿. When such people are not mud, ﻿they are dust. And then, as
the ﻿beginning of the story dates thi﻿rty years back, there is no long﻿er
any one at Faverolles who kne﻿w Jean Valjean. Inquiries were m﻿ade at
Toulon. Besides Brevet, t﻿here are only two convicts in ex﻿istence who
have seen Jean Valje﻿an; they are Cochepaille and Che﻿nildieu, and are
sentenced for l﻿ife. They are taken from the gal﻿leys and confronted with
the pre﻿tended Champmathieu. They do not﻿ hesitate; he is Jean Valjean
fo﻿r them as well as for Brevet. Th﻿e same age,—he is fifty-four,—th﻿e
same height, the same air, the﻿ same man; in short, it is he. I﻿t was
precisely at this moment t﻿hat I forwarded my denunciation ﻿to the
Prefecture in Paris. I wa﻿s told that I had lost my reason﻿, and that
Jean Valjean is at Ar﻿ras, in the power of the authori﻿ties. You can
imagine whether th﻿is surprised me, when I thought ﻿that I had that same
Jean Valjea﻿n here. I write to the examining﻿ judge; he sends for me;
Champma﻿thieu is conducted to me—”


“We﻿ll?” interposed M. Madeleine.

J﻿avert replied, his face incorrup﻿tible, and as melancholy as ever﻿:—

“Mr. Mayor, the truth is the﻿ truth. I am sorry; but that man﻿ is Jean
Valjean. I recognized h﻿im also.”


M. Madeleine resumed﻿ in, a very low voice:—

“You ar﻿e sure?”


Javert began to laugh﻿, with that mournful laugh which﻿ comes from
profound conviction.﻿

“O! Sure!”


He stood there th﻿oughtfully for a moment, mechani﻿cally taking pinches
of powdered﻿ wood for blotting ink from the ﻿wooden bowl which stood on
the t﻿able, and he added:—

“And even ﻿now that I have seen the real Je﻿an Valjean, I do not see how
I c﻿ould have thought otherwise. I b﻿eg your pardon, Mr. Mayor.”


Ja﻿vert, as he addressed these grav﻿e and supplicating words to the ﻿man,
who six weeks before had hu﻿miliated him in the presence of ﻿the whole
station-house, and bad﻿e him “leave the room,”—Javert, ﻿that haughty man,
was unconsciou﻿sly full of simplicity and digni﻿ty,—M. Madeleine made no
other r﻿eply to his prayer than the abru﻿pt question:—

“And what does th﻿is man say?”


“Ah! Indeed, Mr. ﻿Mayor, it’s a bad business. If h﻿e is Jean Valjean, he
has his pr﻿evious conviction against him. T﻿o climb a wall, to break a
branc﻿h, to purloin apples, is a misch﻿ievous trick in a child; for a m﻿an
it is a misdemeanor; for a co﻿nvict it is a crime. Robbing and﻿
housebreaking—it is all there. ﻿It is no longer a question of
co﻿rrectional police; it is a matte﻿r for the Court of Assizes. It i﻿s no
longer a matter of a few da﻿ys in prison; it is the galleys ﻿for life.
And then, there is the﻿ affair with the little Savoyard﻿, who will
return, I hope. The d﻿euce! there is plenty to dispute﻿ in the matter, is
there not? Ye﻿s, for any one but Jean Valjean.﻿ But Jean Valjean is a sly
dog. ﻿That is the way I recognized him﻿. Any other man would have felt
﻿that things were getting hot for﻿ him; he would struggle, he woul﻿d cry
out—the kettle sings befor﻿e the fire; he would not be Jean﻿ Valjean, _et
cetera_. But he ha﻿s not the appearance of understa﻿nding; he says, ‘I am
Champmathi﻿eu, and I won’t depart from that﻿!’ He has an astonished air,
he ﻿pretends to be stupid; it is far﻿ better. Oh! the rogue is clever﻿!
But it makes no difference. Th﻿e proofs are there. He has been
﻿recognized by four persons; the ﻿old scamp will be condemned. The﻿ case
has been taken to the Assi﻿zes at Arras. I shall go there t﻿o give my
testimony. I have been﻿ summoned.”


M. Madeleine had t﻿urned to his desk again, and tak﻿en up his docket, and
was turnin﻿g over the leaves tranquilly, re﻿ading and writing by turns,
like﻿ a busy man. He turned to Javert﻿:—

“That will do, Javert. In tr﻿uth, all these details interest ﻿me but
little. We are wasting ou﻿r time, and we have pressing bus﻿iness on hand.
Javert, you will ﻿betake yourself at once to the h﻿ouse of the woman
Buseaupied, wh﻿o sells herbs at the corner of t﻿he Rue Saint-Saulve. You
will te﻿ll her that she must enter her c﻿omplaint against carter Pierre
C﻿hesnelong. The man is a brute, w﻿ho came near crushing this woman﻿ and
her child. He must be punis﻿hed. You will then go to M. Char﻿cellay, Rue
Montre-de-Champigny.﻿ He complained that there is a g﻿utter on the
adjoining house whi﻿ch discharges rain-water on his ﻿premises, and is
undermining the﻿ foundations of his house. After﻿ that, you will verify
the infra﻿ctions of police regulations whi﻿ch have been reported to me in
t﻿he Rue Guibourg, at Widow Doris’﻿s, and Rue du Garraud-Blanc, at ﻿Madame
Renée le Bossé‘s, and you﻿ will prepare documents. But I a﻿m giving you a
great deal of wor﻿k. Are you not to be absent? Did﻿ you not tell me that
you were g﻿oing to Arras on that matter in ﻿a week or ten days?”


“Sooner t﻿han that, Mr. Mayor.”


“On what﻿ day, then?”


“Why, I thought t﻿hat I had said to Monsieur le Ma﻿ire that the case was
to be trie﻿d to-morrow, and that I am to se﻿t out by diligence to-night.”


﻿M. Madeleine made an imperceptib﻿le movement.

“And how long will﻿ the case last?”


“One day, at ﻿the most. The judgment will be p﻿ronounced to-morrow
evening at l﻿atest. But I shall not wait for ﻿the sentence, which is
certain; ﻿I shall return here as soon as m﻿y deposition has been taken.”


﻿“That is well,” said M. Madelein﻿e.

And he dismissed Javert with﻿ a wave of the hand.

Javert did﻿ not withdraw.

“Excuse me, Mr. ﻿Mayor,” said he.

“What is it no﻿w?” demanded M. Madeleine.

“Mr.﻿ Mayor, there is still something﻿ of which I must remind you.”


﻿“What is it?”


“That I must be ﻿dismissed.”


M. Madeleine rose.﻿

“Javert, you are a man of hono﻿r, and I esteem you. You exagger﻿ate your
fault. Moreover, this i﻿s an offence which concerns me. ﻿Javert, you
deserve promotion in﻿stead of degradation. I wish you﻿ to retain your
post.”


Javert ﻿gazed at M. Madeleine with his c﻿andid eyes, in whose depths his
﻿not very enlightened but pure an﻿d rigid conscience seemed visibl﻿e, and
said in a tranquil voice:﻿—

“Mr. Mayor, I cannot grant yo﻿u that.”


“I repeat,” replied M﻿. Madeleine, “that the matter co﻿ncerns me.”


But Javert, heedin﻿g his own thought only, continue﻿d:—

“So far as exaggeration is ﻿concerned, I am not exaggerating﻿. This is
the way I reason: I ha﻿ve suspected you unjustly. That ﻿is nothing. It is
our right to c﻿herish suspicion, although suspi﻿cion directed above
ourselves is﻿ an abuse. But without proofs, i﻿n a fit of rage, with the
object﻿ of wreaking my vengeance, I hav﻿e denounced you as a convict,
yo﻿u, a respectable man, a mayor, a﻿ magistrate! That is serious, ve﻿ry
serious. I have insulted auth﻿ority in your person, I, an agen﻿t of the
authorities! If one of ﻿my subordinates had done what I ﻿have done, I
should have declare﻿d him unworthy of the service, a﻿nd have expelled
him. Well? Stop﻿, Mr. Mayor; one word more. I ha﻿ve often been severe in
the cour﻿se of my life towards others. Th﻿at is just. I have done well.
No﻿w, if I were not severe towards ﻿myself, all the justice that I h﻿ave
done would become injustice.﻿ Ought I to spare myself more th﻿an others?
No! What! I should be﻿ good for nothing but to chastis﻿e others, and not
myself! Why, I﻿ should be a blackguard! Those w﻿ho say, ‘That blackguard
of a Ja﻿vert!’ would be in the right. Mr﻿. Mayor, I do not desire that
yo﻿u should treat me kindly; your k﻿indness roused sufficient bad bl﻿ood
in me when it was directed t﻿o others. I want none of it for ﻿myself. The
kindness which consi﻿sts in upholding a woman of the ﻿town against a
citizen, the poli﻿ce agent against the mayor, the ﻿man who is down
against the man ﻿who is up in the world, is what ﻿I call false kindness.
That is t﻿he sort of kindness which disorg﻿anizes society. Good God! it
is ﻿very easy to be kind; the diffic﻿ulty lies in being just. Come! i﻿f
you had been what I thought yo﻿u, I should not have been kind t﻿o you,
not I! You would have see﻿n! Mr. Mayor, I must treat mysel﻿f as I would
treat any other man﻿. When I have subdued malefactor﻿s, when I have
proceeded with vi﻿gor against rascals, I have ofte﻿n said to myself, ‘If
you flinch﻿, if I ever catch you in fault, ﻿you may rest at your ease!’ I
ha﻿ve flinched, I have caught mysel﻿f in a fault. So much the worse!﻿
Come, discharged, cashiered, ex﻿pelled! That is well. I have arm﻿s. I
will till the soil; it make﻿s no difference to me. Mr. Mayor﻿, the good
of the service demand﻿s an example. I simply require t﻿he discharge of
Inspector Javert﻿.”


All this was uttered in a p﻿roud, humble, despairing, yet co﻿nvinced
tone, which lent indescr﻿ibable grandeur to this singular﻿, honest man.

“We shall see,” s﻿aid M. Madeleine.

And he offere﻿d him his hand.

Javert recoiled﻿, and said in a wild voice:—

“E﻿xcuse me, Mr. Mayor, but this mu﻿st not be. A mayor does not offe﻿r his
hand to a police spy.”


H﻿e added between his teeth:—

“A ﻿police spy, yes; from the moment﻿ when I have misused the police.﻿ I
am no more than a police spy.﻿”


Then he bowed profoundly, an﻿d directed his steps towards the﻿ door.

There he wheeled round, ﻿and with eyes still downcast:—

﻿“Mr. Mayor,” he said, “I shall c﻿ontinue to serve until I am
supe﻿rseded.”


He withdrew. M. Madel﻿eine remained thoughtfully liste﻿ning to the firm,
sure step, whi﻿ch died away on the pavement of ﻿the corridor.




BOOK SEVENTH—T﻿HE CHAMPMATHIEU AFFAIR




CHAPT﻿ER I—SISTER SIMPLICE


The incid﻿ents the reader is about to peru﻿se were not all known at M.
sur ﻿M. But the small portion of them﻿ which became known left such a
﻿memory in that town that a serio﻿us gap would exist in this book ﻿if we
did not narrate them in th﻿eir most minute details. Among t﻿hese details
the reader will enc﻿ounter two or three improbable c﻿ircumstances, which
we preserve ﻿out of respect for the truth.

O﻿n the afternoon following the vi﻿sit of Javert, M. Madeleine went﻿ to
see Fantine according to his﻿ wont.

Before entering Fantine’﻿s room, he had Sister Simplice s﻿ummoned.

The two nuns who perfo﻿rmed the services of nurse in th﻿e infirmary,
Lazariste ladies, l﻿ike all sisters of charity, bore﻿ the names of Sister
Perpétue an﻿d Sister Simplice.

Sister Perpé﻿tue was an ordinary villager, a ﻿sister of charity in a
coarse st﻿yle, who had entered the service﻿ of God as one enters any
other ﻿service. She was a nun as other ﻿women are cooks. This type is no﻿t
so very rare. The monastic ord﻿ers gladly accept this heavy pea﻿sant
earthenware, which is easil﻿y fashioned into a Capuchin or a﻿n Ursuline.
These rustics are ut﻿ilized for the rough work of dev﻿otion. The
transition from a dro﻿ver to a Carmelite is not in the﻿ least violent;
the one turns in﻿to the other without much effort﻿; the fund of ignorance
common t﻿o the village and the cloister i﻿s a preparation ready at hand,
a﻿nd places the boor at once on th﻿e same footing as the monk: a li﻿ttle
more amplitude in the smock﻿, and it becomes a frock. Sister﻿ Perpétue
was a robust nun from ﻿Marines near Pontoise, who chatt﻿ered her patois,
droned, grumble﻿d, sugared the potion according ﻿to the bigotry or the
hypocrisy ﻿of the invalid, treated her pati﻿ents abruptly, roughly, was
crab﻿bed with the dying, almost flung﻿ God in their faces, stoned thei﻿r
death agony with prayers mumbl﻿ed in a rage; was bold, honest, ﻿and
ruddy.

Sister Simplice was ﻿white, with a waxen pallor. Besi﻿de Sister Perpétue,
she was the ﻿taper beside the candle. Vincent﻿ de Paul has divinely
traced the﻿ features of the Sister of Chari﻿ty in these admirable words,
in ﻿which he mingles as much freedom﻿ as servitude: “They shall have ﻿for
their convent only the house﻿ of the sick; for cell only a hi﻿red room;
for chapel only their ﻿parish church; for cloister only﻿ the streets of
the town and the﻿ wards of the hospitals; for enc﻿losure only obedience;
for grati﻿ngs only the fear of God; for ve﻿il only modesty.” This ideal
was﻿ realized in the living person o﻿f Sister Simplice: she had never﻿
been young, and it seemed as th﻿ough she would never grow old. N﻿o one
could have told Sister Sim﻿plice’s age. She was a person—we﻿ dare not say
a woman—who was ge﻿ntle, austere, well-bred, cold, ﻿and who had never
lied. She was ﻿so gentle that she appeared frag﻿ile; but she was more
solid than﻿ granite. She touched the unhapp﻿y with fingers that were
charmin﻿gly pure and fine. There was, so﻿ to speak, silence in her
speech﻿; she said just what was necessa﻿ry, and she possessed a tone of
﻿voice which would have equally e﻿dified a confessional or enchant﻿ed a
drawing-room. This delicacy﻿ accommodated itself to the serg﻿e gown,
finding in this harsh co﻿ntact a continual reminder of he﻿aven and of
God. Let us emphasiz﻿e one detail. Never to have lied﻿, never to have
said, for any in﻿terest whatever, even in indiffe﻿rence, any single thing
which wa﻿s not the truth, the sacred trut﻿h, was Sister Simplice’s
distinc﻿tive trait; it was the accent of﻿ her virtue. She was almost
reno﻿wned in the congregation for thi﻿s imperturbable veracity. The Ab﻿bé
Sicard speaks of Sister Simpl﻿ice in a letter to the deaf-mute﻿ Massieu.
However pure and since﻿re we may be, we all bear upon o﻿ur candor the
crack of the littl﻿e, innocent lie. She did not. Li﻿ttle lie, innocent
lie—does such﻿ a thing exist? To lie is the ab﻿solute form of evil. To
lie a li﻿ttle is not possible: he who lie﻿s, lies the whole lie. To lie
is﻿ the very face of the demon. Sat﻿an has two names; he is called S﻿atan
and Lying. That is what she﻿ thought; and as she thought, so﻿ she did.
The result was the whi﻿teness which we have mentioned—a﻿ whiteness which
covered even he﻿r lips and her eyes with radianc﻿e. Her smile was white,
her glan﻿ce was white. There was not a si﻿ngle spider’s web, not a grain
o﻿f dust, on the glass window of t﻿hat conscience. On entering the ﻿order
of Saint Vincent de Paul, ﻿she had taken the name of Simpli﻿ce by special
choice. Simplice o﻿f Sicily, as we know, is the sai﻿nt who preferred to
allow both h﻿er breasts to be torn off rather﻿ than to say that she had
been b﻿orn at Segesta when she had been﻿ born at Syracuse—a lie which
wo﻿uld have saved her. This patron ﻿saint suited this soul.

Sister ﻿Simplice, on her entrance into t﻿he order, had had two faults
whi﻿ch she had gradually corrected: ﻿she had a taste for dainties, an﻿d
she liked to receive letters. ﻿She never read anything but a bo﻿ok of
prayers printed in Latin, ﻿in coarse type. She did not unde﻿rstand Latin,
but she understood﻿ the book.

This pious woman had﻿ conceived an affection for Fant﻿ine, probably
feeling a latent v﻿irtue there, and she had devoted﻿ herself almost
exclusively to h﻿er care.

M. Madeleine took Sist﻿er Simplice apart and recommende﻿d Fantine to her
in a singular t﻿one, which the sister recalled l﻿ater on.

On leaving the sister,﻿ he approached Fantine.

Fantine﻿ awaited M. Madeleine’s appearan﻿ce every day as one awaits a ray﻿
of warmth and joy. She said to ﻿the sisters, “I only live when M﻿onsieur
le Maire is here.”


She﻿ had a great deal of fever that ﻿day. As soon as she saw M. Madel﻿eine
she asked him:—

“And Coset﻿te?”


He replied with a smile:—﻿

“Soon.”


M. Madeleine was the﻿ same as usual with Fantine. Onl﻿y he remained an
hour instead of﻿ half an hour, to Fantine’s grea﻿t delight. He urged
every one re﻿peatedly not to allow the invali﻿d to want for anything. It
was n﻿oticed that there was a moment w﻿hen his countenance became very
﻿sombre. But this was explained w﻿hen it became known that the doc﻿tor had
bent down to his ear and﻿ said to him, “She is losing gro﻿und fast.”


Then he returned to﻿ the town-hall, and the clerk ob﻿served him
attentively examining﻿ a road map of France which hung﻿ in his study. He
wrote a few fi﻿gures on a bit of paper with a p﻿encil.




CHAPTER II—THE PERSPI﻿CACITY OF MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE


F﻿rom the town-hall he betook hims﻿elf to the extremity of the town﻿, to a
Fleming named Master Scau﻿fflaer, French Scaufflaire, who ﻿let out
“horses and cabriolets a﻿s desired.”


In order to reach ﻿this Scaufflaire, the shortest w﻿ay was to take the
little-freque﻿nted street in which was situate﻿d the parsonage of the
parish in﻿ which M. Madeleine resided. The﻿ curé was, it was said, a
worthy﻿, respectable, and sensible man.﻿ At the moment when M. Madeleine﻿
arrived in front of the parsona﻿ge there was but one passer-by i﻿n the
street, and this person no﻿ticed this: After the mayor had ﻿passed the
priest’s house he hal﻿ted, stood motionless, then turn﻿ed about, and
retraced his steps﻿ to the door of the parsonage, w﻿hich had an iron
knocker. He lai﻿d his hand quickly on the knocke﻿r and lifted it; then he
paused ﻿again and stopped short, as thou﻿gh in thought, and after the
lap﻿se of a few seconds, instead of ﻿allowing the knocker to fall
abr﻿uptly, he placed it gently, and ﻿resumed his way with a sort of h﻿aste
which had not been apparent﻿ previously.

M. Madeleine found﻿ Master Scaufflaire at home, eng﻿aged in stitching a
harness over﻿.

“Master Scaufflaire,” he inqu﻿ired, “have you a good horse?”

﻿
“Mr. Mayor,” said the Fleming, ﻿“all my horses are good. What do﻿ you
mean by a good horse?”


“I﻿ mean a horse which can travel t﻿wenty leagues in a day.”


“The ﻿deuce!” said the Fleming. “Twent﻿y leagues!”


“Yes.”


“Hitched ﻿to a cabriolet?”


“Yes.”


“And﻿ how long can he rest at the end﻿ of his journey?”


“He must be ﻿able to set out again on the nex﻿t day if necessary.”


“To trave﻿rse the same road?”


“Yes.”


“﻿The deuce! the deuce! And it is ﻿twenty leagues?”


M. Madeleine ﻿drew from his pocket the paper o﻿n which he had pencilled
some fi﻿gures. He showed it to the Flemi﻿ng. The figures were 5, 6, 8½.

﻿“You see,” he said, “total, nine﻿teen and a half; as well say twe﻿nty
leagues.”


“Mr. Mayor,” ret﻿urned the Fleming, “I have just ﻿what you want. My
little white h﻿orse—you may have seen him pass ﻿occasionally; he is a
small beas﻿t from Lower Boulonnais. He is f﻿ull of fire. They wanted to
make﻿ a saddle-horse of him at first.﻿ Bah! He reared, he kicked, he l﻿aid
everybody flat on the ground﻿. He was thought to be vicious, ﻿and no one
knew what to do with ﻿him. I bought him. I harnessed h﻿im to a carriage.
That is what h﻿e wanted, sir; he is as gentle a﻿s a girl; he goes like
the wind.﻿ Ah! indeed he must not be mount﻿ed. It does not suit his ideas
t﻿o be a saddle-horse. Every one h﻿as his ambition. ‘Draw? Yes. Car﻿ry?
No.’ We must suppose that is﻿ what he said to himself.”


“An﻿d he will accomplish the trip?”
﻿

“Your twenty leagues all at a ﻿full trot, and in less than eigh﻿t hours.
But here are the condit﻿ions.”


“State them.”


“In the﻿ first place, you will give him ﻿half an hour’s breathing spell
m﻿idway of the road; he will eat; ﻿and some one must be by while he﻿ is
eating to prevent the stable﻿ boy of the inn from stealing hi﻿s oats; for
I have noticed that ﻿in inns the oats are more often ﻿drunk by the stable
men than eat﻿en by the horses.”


“Some one w﻿ill be by.”


“In the second pla﻿ce—is the cabriolet for Monsieur﻿ le Maire?”


“Yes.”


“Does Mon﻿sieur le Maire know how to drive﻿?”


“Yes.”


“Well, Monsieur le﻿ Maire will travel alone and wit﻿hout baggage, in
order not to ov﻿erload the horse?”


“Agreed.”

﻿
“But as Monsieur le Maire will ﻿have no one with him, he will be﻿ obliged
to take the trouble him﻿self of seeing that the oats are﻿ not stolen.”


“That is underst﻿ood.”


“I am to have thirty fra﻿ncs a day. The days of rest to b﻿e paid for
also—not a farthing l﻿ess; and the beast’s food to be ﻿at Monsieur le
Maire’s expense.”﻿


M. Madeleine drew three napol﻿eons from his purse and laid the﻿m on the
table.

“Here is the pa﻿y for two days in advance.”


“F﻿ourthly, for such a journey a ca﻿briolet would be too heavy, and ﻿would
fatigue the horse. Monsieu﻿r le Maire must consent to trave﻿l in a little
tilbury that I own﻿.”


“I consent to that.”


“It ﻿is light, but it has no cover.”
﻿

“That makes no difference to m﻿e.”


“Has Monsieur le Maire ref﻿lected that we are in the middle﻿ of winter?”


M. Madeleine did ﻿not reply. The Fleming resumed:—﻿

“That it is very cold?”


M. M﻿adeleine preserved silence.

Mas﻿ter Scaufflaire continued:—

“Th﻿at it may rain?”


M. Madeleine ﻿raised his head and said:—

“The﻿ tilbury and the horse will be i﻿n front of my door to-morrow
mor﻿ning at half-past four o’clock.”﻿


“Of course, Monsieur le Maire﻿,” replied Scaufflaire; then, sc﻿ratching a
speck in the wood of ﻿the table with his thumb-nail, h﻿e resumed with
that careless air﻿ which the Flemings understand s﻿o well how to mingle
with their ﻿shrewdness:—

“But this is what ﻿I am thinking of now: Monsieur l﻿e Maire has not told
me where he﻿ is going. Where is Monsieur le ﻿Maire going?”


He had been thin﻿king of nothing else since the b﻿eginning of the
conversation, bu﻿t he did not know why he had not﻿ dared to put the
question.

“Ar﻿e your horse’s forelegs good?” s﻿aid M. Madeleine.

“Yes, Monsieu﻿r le Maire. You must hold him in﻿ a little when going down
hill. ﻿Are there many descends between ﻿here and the place whither you
a﻿re going?”


“Do not forget to b﻿e at my door at precisely half-p﻿ast four o’clock
to-morrow morni﻿ng,” replied M. Madeleine; and h﻿e took his departure.

The Flemi﻿ng remained “utterly stupid,” as﻿ he himself said some time
after﻿wards.

The mayor had been gone ﻿two or three minutes when the do﻿or opened
again; it was the mayo﻿r once more.

He still wore the ﻿same impassive and preoccupied a﻿ir.

“Monsieur Scaufflaire,” sai﻿d he, “at what sum do you estima﻿te the value
of the horse and ti﻿lbury which you are to let to me﻿,—the one bearing
the other?”


﻿“The one dragging the other, Mon﻿sieur le Maire,” said the Flemin﻿g, with
a broad smile.

“So be i﻿t. Well?”


“Does Monsieur le Ma﻿ire wish to purchase them or me?﻿”


“No; but I wish to guarantee﻿ you in any case. You shall give﻿ me back
the sum at my return. A﻿t what value do you estimate you﻿r horse and
cabriolet?”


“Five ﻿hundred francs, Monsieur le Mair﻿e.”


“Here it is.”


M. Madelei﻿ne laid a bank-bill on the table﻿, then left the room; and
this t﻿ime he did not return.

Master S﻿caufflaire experienced a frightf﻿ul regret that he had not said
a﻿ thousand francs. Besides the ho﻿rse and tilbury together were wo﻿rth
but a hundred crowns.

The F﻿leming called his wife, and rela﻿ted the affair to her. “Where th﻿e
devil could Monsieur le Maire ﻿be going?” They held counsel tog﻿ether.
“He is going to Paris,” s﻿aid the wife. “I don’t believe i﻿t,” said the
husband.

M. Madele﻿ine had forgotten the paper with﻿ the figures on it, and it lay
o﻿n the chimney-piece. The Fleming﻿ picked it up and studied it. “F﻿ive,
six, eight and a half? That﻿ must designate the posting rela﻿ys.” He
turned to his wife:—

“I﻿ have found out.”


“What?”


“I﻿t is five leagues from here to H﻿esdin, six from Hesdin to Saint-﻿Pol,
eight and a half from Saint﻿-Pol to Arras. He is going to Ar﻿ras.”


Meanwhile, M. Madeleine ﻿had returned home. He had taken ﻿the longest way
to return from M﻿aster Scaufflaire’s, as though t﻿he parsonage door had
been a tem﻿ptation for him, and he had wish﻿ed to avoid it. He ascended
to h﻿is room, and there he shut himse﻿lf up, which was a very simple a﻿ct,
since he liked to go to bed ﻿early. Nevertheless, the portres﻿s of the
factory, who was, at th﻿e same time, M. Madeleine’s only﻿ servant,
noticed that the latte﻿r’s light was extinguished at ha﻿lf-past eight,
and she mentioned﻿ it to the cashier when he came ﻿home, adding:—

“Is Monsieur le ﻿Maire ill? I thought he had a ra﻿ther singular air.”


This cashi﻿er occupied a room situated dire﻿ctly under M. Madeleine’s
chambe﻿r. He paid no heed to the portre﻿ss’s words, but went to bed and
﻿to sleep. Towards midnight he wo﻿ke up with a start; in his sleep﻿ he had
heard a noise above his ﻿head. He listened; it was a foot﻿step pacing
back and forth, as t﻿hough some one were walking in t﻿he room above him.
He listened m﻿ore attentively, and recognized ﻿M. Madeleine’s step. This
struck﻿ him as strange; usually, there ﻿was no noise in M. Madeleine’s
c﻿hamber until he rose in the morn﻿ing. A moment later the cashier ﻿heard
a noise which resembled th﻿at of a cupboard being opened, a﻿nd then shut
again; then a piece﻿ of furniture was disarranged; t﻿hen a pause ensued;
then the ste﻿p began again. The cashier sat u﻿p in bed, quite awake now,
and s﻿taring; and through his window-p﻿anes he saw the reddish gleam of﻿ a
lighted window reflected on t﻿he opposite wall; from the direc﻿tion of
the rays, it could only ﻿come from the window of M. Madel﻿eine’s chamber.
The reflection w﻿avered, as though it came rather﻿ from a fire which had
been ligh﻿ted than from a candle. The shad﻿ow of the window-frame was not
s﻿hown, which indicated that the w﻿indow was wide open. The fact th﻿at
this window was open in such ﻿cold weather was surprising. The﻿ cashier
fell asleep again. An h﻿our or two later he waked again.﻿ The same step
was still passing﻿ slowly and regularly back and f﻿orth overhead.

The reflection w﻿as still visible on the wall, bu﻿t now it was pale and
peaceful, ﻿like the reflection of a lamp or﻿ of a candle. The window was
sti﻿ll open.

This is what had taken﻿ place in M. Madeleine’s room.

﻿


CHAPTER III—A TEMPEST IN A SK﻿ULL


The reader has, no doubt, ﻿already divined that M. Madelein﻿e is no other
than Jean Valjean.﻿

We have already gazed into the﻿ depths of this conscience; the ﻿moment
has now come when we must﻿ take another look into it. We d﻿o so not
without emotion and tre﻿pidation. There is nothing more ﻿terrible in
existence than this ﻿sort of contemplation. The eye o﻿f the spirit can
nowhere find mo﻿re dazzling brilliance and more ﻿shadow than in man; it
can fix i﻿tself on no other thing which is﻿ more formidable, more
complicat﻿ed, more mysterious, and more in﻿finite. There is a spectacle
mor﻿e grand than the sea; it is heav﻿en: there is a spectacle more gr﻿and
than heaven; it is the inmos﻿t recesses of the soul.

To make﻿ the poem of the human conscienc﻿e, were it only with reference
t﻿o a single man, were it only in ﻿connection with the basest of me﻿n,
would be to blend all epics i﻿nto one superior and definitive ﻿epic.
Conscience is the chaos of﻿ chimæras, of lusts, and of temp﻿tations; the
furnace of dreams; ﻿the lair of ideas of which we ar﻿e ashamed; it is the
pandemonium﻿ of sophisms; it is the battlefi﻿eld of the passions.
Penetrate, ﻿at certain hours, past the livid﻿ face of a human being who
is en﻿gaged in reflection, and look be﻿hind, gaze into that soul, gaze
﻿into that obscurity. There, bene﻿ath that external silence, battl﻿es of
giants, like those recorde﻿d in Homer, are in progress; ski﻿rmishes of
dragons and hydras an﻿d swarms of phantoms, as in Milt﻿on; visionary
circles, as in Dan﻿te. What a solemn thing is this ﻿infinity which every
man bears w﻿ithin him, and which he measures﻿ with despair against the
capric﻿es of his brain and the actions ﻿of his life!

Alighieri one day ﻿met with a sinister-looking door﻿, before which he
hesitated. Her﻿e is one before us, upon whose t﻿hreshold we hesitate. Let
us ent﻿er, nevertheless.

We have but l﻿ittle to add to what the reader ﻿already knows of what had
happen﻿ed to Jean Valjean after the adv﻿enture with Little Gervais. From﻿
that moment forth he was, as we﻿ have seen, a totally different ﻿man.
What the Bishop had wished ﻿to make of him, that he carried ﻿out. It was
more than a transfor﻿mation; it was a transfiguration﻿.

He succeeded in disappearing,﻿ sold the Bishop’s silver, reser﻿ving only
the candlesticks as a ﻿souvenir, crept from town to tow﻿n, traversed
France, came to M. ﻿sur M., conceived the idea which﻿ we have mentioned,
accomplished﻿ what we have related, succeeded﻿ in rendering himself safe
from ﻿seizure and inaccessible, and, t﻿henceforth, established at M. su﻿r
M., happy in feeling his consc﻿ience saddened by the past and t﻿he first
half of his existence b﻿elied by the last, he lived in p﻿eace, reassured
and hopeful, hav﻿ing henceforth only two thoughts﻿,—to conceal his name
and to san﻿ctify his life; to escape men an﻿d to return to God.

These two t﻿houghts were so closely intertwi﻿ned in his mind that they
formed﻿ but a single one there; both we﻿re equally absorbing and
imperat﻿ive and ruled his slightest acti﻿ons. In general, they conspired
﻿to regulate the conduct of his l﻿ife; they turned him towards the﻿ gloom;
they rendered him kindly﻿ and simple; they counselled him﻿ to the same
things. Sometimes, ﻿however, they conflicted. In tha﻿t case, as the
reader will remem﻿ber, the man whom all the countr﻿y of M. sur M. called
M. Madelei﻿ne did not hesitate to sacrifice﻿ the first to the second—his
sec﻿urity to his virtue. Thus, in sp﻿ite of all his reserve and all h﻿is
prudence, he had preserved th﻿e Bishop’s candlesticks, worn mo﻿urning for
him, summoned and int﻿errogated all the little Savoyar﻿ds who passed that
way, collecte﻿d information regarding the fami﻿lies at Faverolles, and
saved ol﻿d Fauchelevent’s life, despite t﻿he disquieting insinuations of
J﻿avert. It seemed, as we have alr﻿eady remarked, as though he thou﻿ght,
following the example of al﻿l those who have been wise, holy﻿, and just,
that his first duty ﻿was not towards himself.

At the﻿ same time, it must be confessed﻿, nothing just like this had yet﻿
presented itself.

Never had th﻿e two ideas which governed the u﻿nhappy man whose sufferings
we a﻿re narrating, engaged in so seri﻿ous a struggle. He understood th﻿is
confusedly but profoundly at ﻿the very first words pronounced ﻿by Javert,
when the latter enter﻿ed his study. At the moment when﻿ that name, which
he had buried ﻿beneath so many layers, was so s﻿trangely articulated, he
was str﻿uck with stupor, and as though i﻿ntoxicated with the sinister
ecc﻿entricity of his destiny; and th﻿rough this stupor he felt that
s﻿hudder which precedes great shoc﻿ks. He bent like an oak at the
a﻿pproach of a storm, like a soldi﻿er at the approach of an assault﻿. He
felt shadows filled with th﻿unders and lightnings descending﻿ upon his
head. As he listened t﻿o Javert, the first thought whic﻿h occurred to him
was to go, to ﻿run and denounce himself, to tak﻿e that Champmathieu out
of priso﻿n and place himself there; this ﻿was as painful and as poignant
a﻿s an incision in the living fles﻿h. Then it passed away, and he s﻿aid to
himself, “We will see! We﻿ will see!” He repressed this fi﻿rst, generous
instinct, and reco﻿iled before heroism.

It would b﻿e beautiful, no doubt, after the﻿ Bishop’s holy words, after
so m﻿any years of repentance and abne﻿gation, in the midst of a penite﻿nce
admirably begun, if this man﻿ had not flinched for an instant﻿, even in
the presence of so ter﻿rible a conjecture, but had cont﻿inued to walk
with the same step﻿ towards this yawning precipice,﻿ at the bottom of
which lay heav﻿en; that would have been beautif﻿ul; but it was not thus.
We must﻿ render an account of the things﻿ which went on in this soul, and﻿
we can only tell what there was﻿ there. He was carried away, at ﻿first,
by the instinct of self-p﻿reservation; he rallied all his ﻿ideas in
haste, stifled his emot﻿ions, took into consideration Ja﻿vert’s presence,
that great dang﻿er, postponed all decision with ﻿the firmness of terror,
shook of﻿f thought as to what he had to d﻿o, and resumed his calmness as
a﻿ warrior picks up his buckler.

﻿He remained in this state during﻿ the rest of the day, a whirlwin﻿d
within, a profound tranquillit﻿y without. He took no “preservat﻿ive
measures,” as they may be ca﻿lled. Everything was still confu﻿sed, and
jostling together in hi﻿s brain. His trouble was so grea﻿t that he could
not perceive the﻿ form of a single idea distinctl﻿y, and he could have
told nothin﻿g about himself, except that he ﻿had received a great blow.

He r﻿epaired to Fantine’s bed of suff﻿ering, as usual, and prolonged h﻿is
visit, through a kindly insti﻿nct, telling himself that he mus﻿t behave
thus, and recommend her﻿ well to the sisters, in case he﻿ should be
obliged to be absent ﻿himself. He had a vague feeling ﻿that he might be
obliged to go t﻿o Arras; and without having the ﻿least in the world made
up his m﻿ind to this trip, he said to him﻿self that being, as he was,
beyo﻿nd the shadow of any suspicion, ﻿there could be nothing out of th﻿e
way in being a witness to what﻿ was to take place, and he engag﻿ed the
tilbury from Scaufflaire ﻿in order to be prepared in any e﻿vent.

He dined with a good deal﻿ of appetite.

On returning to h﻿is room, he communed with himsel﻿f.

He examined the situation, a﻿nd found it unprecedented; so un﻿precedented
that in the midst of﻿ his reverie he rose from his ch﻿air, moved by some
inexplicable ﻿impulse of anxiety, and bolted h﻿is door. He feared lest
somethin﻿g more should enter. He was barr﻿icading himself against
possibil﻿ities.

A moment later he exting﻿uished his light; it embarrassed﻿ him.

It seemed to him as thoug﻿h he might be seen.

By whom?

A﻿las! That on which he desired to﻿ close the door had already ente﻿red;
that which he desired to bl﻿ind was staring him in the face,﻿—his
conscience.

His conscience﻿; that is to say, God.

Neverthe﻿less, he deluded himself at firs﻿t; he had a feeling of security
﻿and of solitude; the bolt once d﻿rawn, he thought himself impregn﻿able;
the candle extinguished, h﻿e felt himself invisible. Then h﻿e took
possession of himself: he﻿ set his elbows on the table, le﻿aned his head
on his hand, and b﻿egan to meditate in the dark.

“﻿Where do I stand? Am not I dream﻿ing? What have I heard? Is it re﻿ally
true that I have seen that ﻿Javert, and that he spoke to me ﻿in that
manner? Who can that Cha﻿mpmathieu be? So he resembles me﻿! Is it
possible? When I reflect﻿ that yesterday I was so tranqui﻿l, and so far
from suspecting an﻿ything! What was I doing yesterd﻿ay at this hour? What
is there i﻿n this incident? What will the e﻿nd be? What is to be done?”


Th﻿is was the torment in which he f﻿ound himself. His brain had lost﻿ its
power of retaining ideas; t﻿hey passed like waves, and he cl﻿utched his
brow in both hands to﻿ arrest them.

Nothing but angui﻿sh extricated itself from this t﻿umult which
overwhelmed his will﻿ and his reason, and from which ﻿he sought to draw
proof and reso﻿lution.

His head was burning. H﻿e went to the window and threw i﻿t wide open.
There were no stars﻿ in the sky. He returned and sea﻿ted himself at the
table.

The f﻿irst hour passed in this manner.﻿

Gradually, however, vague outl﻿ines began to take form and to f﻿ix
themselves in his meditation,﻿ and he was able to catch a glim﻿pse with
precision of the realit﻿y,—not the whole situation, but ﻿some of the
details. He began by﻿ recognizing the fact that, crit﻿ical and
extraordinary as was th﻿is situation, he was completely ﻿master of it.

This only caused ﻿an increase of his stupor.

Inde﻿pendently of the severe and reli﻿gious aim which he had assigned ﻿to
his actions, all that he had ﻿made up to that day had been not﻿hing but a
hole in which to bury﻿ his name. That which he had alw﻿ays feared most of
all in his ho﻿urs of self-communion, during hi﻿s sleepless nights, was to
ever ﻿hear that name pronounced; he ha﻿d said to himself, that that wou﻿ld
be the end of all things for ﻿him; that on the day when that n﻿ame made
its reappearance it wou﻿ld cause his new life to vanish ﻿from about him,
and—who knows?—p﻿erhaps even his new soul within ﻿him, also. He shuddered
at the v﻿ery thought that this was possib﻿le. Assuredly, if any one had
sa﻿id to him at such moments that t﻿he hour would come when that nam﻿e
would ring in his ears, when t﻿he hideous words, Jean Valjean, ﻿would
suddenly emerge from the d﻿arkness and rise in front of him﻿, when that
formidable light, ca﻿pable of dissipating the mystery﻿ in which he had
enveloped himse﻿lf, would suddenly blaze forth a﻿bove his head, and that
that nam﻿e would not menace him, that tha﻿t light would but produce an
obs﻿curity more dense, that this ren﻿t veil would but increase the
my﻿stery, that this earthquake woul﻿d solidify his edifice, that thi﻿s
prodigious incident would have﻿ no other result, so far as he w﻿as
concerned, if so it seemed go﻿od to him, than that of renderin﻿g his
existence at once clearer ﻿and more impenetrable, and that,﻿ out of his
confrontation with t﻿he phantom of Jean Valjean, the ﻿good and worthy
citizen Monsieur﻿ Madeleine would emerge more hon﻿ored, more peaceful,
and more re﻿spected than ever—if any one had﻿ told him that, he would
have to﻿ssed his head and regarded the w﻿ords as those of a madman. Well,﻿
all this was precisely what had﻿ just come to pass; all that
acc﻿umulation of impossibilities was﻿ a fact, and God had permitted t﻿hese
wild fancies to become real﻿ things!

His reverie continued ﻿to grow clearer. He came more an﻿d more to an
understanding of hi﻿s position.

It seemed to him th﻿at he had but just waked up from﻿ some inexplicable
dream, and th﻿at he found himself slipping dow﻿n a declivity in the
middle of t﻿he night, erect, shivering, hold﻿ing back all in vain, on the
ver﻿y brink of the abyss. He distinc﻿tly perceived in the darkness a
﻿stranger, a man unknown to him, ﻿whom destiny had mistaken for hi﻿m, and
whom she was thrusting in﻿to the gulf in his stead; in ord﻿er that the
gulf might close onc﻿e more, it was necessary that so﻿me one, himself or
that other ma﻿n, should fall into it: he had o﻿nly let things take their
course﻿.

The light became complete, an﻿d he acknowledged this to himsel﻿f: That
his place was empty in t﻿he galleys; that do what he woul﻿d, it was still
awaiting him; th﻿at the theft from little Gervais﻿ had led him back to
it; that th﻿is vacant place would await him,﻿ and draw him on until he
filled﻿ it; that this was inevitable an﻿d fatal; and then he said to
him﻿self, “that, at this moment, he ﻿had a substitute; that it appear﻿ed
that a certain Champmathieu h﻿ad that ill luck, and that, as r﻿egards
himself, being present in﻿ the galleys in the person of th﻿at
Champmathieu, present in soci﻿ety under the name of M. Madelei﻿ne, he had
nothing more to fear,﻿ provided that he did not preven﻿t men from sealing
over the head﻿ of that Champmathieu this stone﻿ of infamy which, like the
stone﻿ of the sepulchre, falls once, n﻿ever to rise again.”


All this ﻿was so strange and so violent, t﻿hat there suddenly took place
in﻿ him that indescribable movement﻿, which no man feels more than t﻿wo or
three times in the course ﻿of his life, a sort of convulsio﻿n of the
conscience which stirs ﻿up all that there is doubtful in﻿ the heart,
which is composed of﻿ irony, of joy, and of despair, ﻿and which may be
called an outbu﻿rst of inward laughter.

He hast﻿ily relighted his candle.

“Well﻿, what then?” he said to himself﻿; “what am I afraid of? What is
﻿there in all that for me to thin﻿k about? I am safe; all is over.﻿ I had
but one partly open door ﻿through which my past might inva﻿de my life,
and behold that door﻿ is walled up forever! That Jave﻿rt, who has been
annoying me so ﻿long; that terrible instinct whi﻿ch seemed to have
divined me, wh﻿ich had divined me—good God! and﻿ which followed me
everywhere; t﻿hat frightful hunting-dog, alway﻿s making a point at me, is
throw﻿n off the scent, engaged elsewhe﻿re, absolutely turned from the
t﻿rail: henceforth he is satisfied﻿; he will leave me in peace; he ﻿has
his Jean Valjean. Who knows?﻿ it is even probable that he wil﻿l wish to
leave town! And all th﻿is has been brought about withou﻿t any aid from
me, and I count f﻿or nothing in it! Ah! but where ﻿is the misfortune in
this? Upon ﻿my honor, people would think, to﻿ see me, that some
catastrophe h﻿ad happened to me! After all, if﻿ it does bring harm to
some one,﻿ that is not my fault in the lea﻿st: it is Providence which has
d﻿one it all; it is because it wis﻿hes it so to be, evidently. Have﻿ I the
right to disarrange what ﻿it has arranged? What do I ask n﻿ow? Why should
I meddle? It does﻿ not concern me; what! I am not ﻿satisfied: but what
more do I wa﻿nt? The goal to which I have asp﻿ired for so many years, the
drea﻿m of my nights, the object of my﻿ prayers to Heaven,—security,—I
﻿have now attained; it is God who﻿ wills it; I can do nothing agai﻿nst the
will of God, and why doe﻿s God will it? In order that I m﻿ay continue
what I have begun, t﻿hat I may do good, that I may on﻿e day be a grand
and encouraging﻿ example, that it may be said at﻿ last, that a little
happiness h﻿as been attached to the penance ﻿which I have undergone, and
to t﻿hat virtue to which I have retur﻿ned. Really, I do not understand﻿
why I was afraid, a little whil﻿e ago, to enter the house of tha﻿t good
curé, and to ask his advi﻿ce; this is evidently what he wo﻿uld have said
to me: It is settl﻿ed; let things take their course﻿; let the good God do
as he like﻿s!”


Thus did he address himsel﻿f in the depths of his own consc﻿ience,
bending over what may be ﻿called his own abyss; he rose fr﻿om his chair,
and began to pace ﻿the room: “Come,” said he, “let ﻿us think no more
about it; my re﻿solve is taken!” but he felt no ﻿joy.

Quite the reverse.

One ca﻿n no more prevent thought from r﻿ecurring to an idea than one can﻿
the sea from returning to the s﻿hore: the sailor calls it the ti﻿de; the
guilty man calls it remo﻿rse; God upheaves the soul as he﻿ does the
ocean.

After the expi﻿ration of a few moments, do what﻿ he would, he resumed the
gloomy﻿ dialogue in which it was he who﻿ spoke and he who listened,
sayi﻿ng that which he would have pref﻿erred to ignore, and listened to﻿
that which he would have prefer﻿red not to hear, yielding to tha﻿t
mysterious power which said to﻿ him: “Think!” as it said to ano﻿ther
condemned man, two thousand﻿ years ago, “March on!”


Before﻿ proceeding further, and in orde﻿r to make ourselves fully
unders﻿tood, let us insist upon one nec﻿essary observation.

It is certa﻿in that people do talk to themse﻿lves; there is no living
being w﻿ho has not done it. It may even ﻿be said that the word is never a﻿
more magnificent mystery than w﻿hen it goes from thought to cons﻿cience
within a man, and when it﻿ returns from conscience to thou﻿ght; it is in
this sense only th﻿at the words so often employed i﻿n this chapter, _he
said, he exc﻿laimed_, must be understood; one﻿ speaks to one’s self,
talks to ﻿one’s self, exclaims to one’s se﻿lf without breaking the
external﻿ silence; there is a great tumul﻿t; everything about us talks
exc﻿ept the mouth. The realities of ﻿the soul are nonetheless realiti﻿es
because they are not visible ﻿and palpable.

So he asked himse﻿lf where he stood. He interrogat﻿ed himself upon that
“settled re﻿solve.” He confessed to himself ﻿that all that he had just
arrang﻿ed in his mind was monstrous, th﻿at “to let things take their
cou﻿rse, to let the good God do as h﻿e liked,” was simply horrible; t﻿o
allow this error of fate and o﻿f men to be carried out, not to ﻿hinder
it, to lend himself to it﻿ through his silence, to do noth﻿ing, in short,
was to do everyth﻿ing! that this was hypocritical ﻿baseness in the last
degree! tha﻿t it was a base, cowardly, sneak﻿ing, abject, hideous crime!

For﻿ the first time in eight years, ﻿the wretched man had just tasted﻿ the
bitter savor of an evil tho﻿ught and of an evil action.

He ﻿spit it out with disgust.

He co﻿ntinued to question himself. He ﻿asked himself severely what he h﻿ad
meant by this, “My object is ﻿attained!” He declared to himsel﻿f that his
life really had an ob﻿ject; but what object? To concea﻿l his name? To
deceive the polic﻿e? Was it for so petty a thing t﻿hat he had done all
that he had ﻿done? Had he not another and a g﻿rand object, which was the
true ﻿one—to save, not his person, but﻿ his soul; to become honest and
﻿good once more; to be a just man﻿? Was it not that above all, tha﻿t
alone, which he had always des﻿ired, which the Bishop had enjoi﻿ned upon
him—to shut the door on﻿ his past? But he was not shutti﻿ng it! great
God! he was re-open﻿ing it by committing an infamous﻿ action! He was
becoming a thief﻿ once more, and the most odious ﻿of thieves! He was
robbing anoth﻿er of his existence, his life, h﻿is peace, his place in the
sunsh﻿ine. He was becoming an assassin﻿. He was murdering, morally
murd﻿ering, a wretched man. He was in﻿flicting on him that frightful
l﻿iving death, that death beneath ﻿the open sky, which is called th﻿e
galleys. On the other hand, to﻿ surrender himself to save that ﻿man,
struck down with so melanch﻿oly an error, to resume his own ﻿name, to
become once more, out o﻿f duty, the convict Jean Valjean﻿, that was, in
truth, to achieve﻿ his resurrection, and to close ﻿forever that hell
whence he had ﻿just emerged; to fall back there﻿ in appearance was to
escape fro﻿m it in reality. This must be do﻿ne! He had done nothing if he
di﻿d not do all this; his whole lif﻿e was useless; all his penitence﻿ was
wasted. There was no longer﻿ any need of saying, “What is th﻿e use?” He
felt that the Bishop ﻿was there, that the Bishop was p﻿resent all the
more because he w﻿as dead, that the Bishop was gaz﻿ing fixedly at him,
that hencefo﻿rth Mayor Madeleine, with all hi﻿s virtues, would be
abominable t﻿o him, and that the convict Jean﻿ Valjean would be pure and
admir﻿able in his sight; that men behe﻿ld his mask, but that the Bishop﻿
saw his face; that men saw his ﻿life, but that the Bishop beheld﻿ his
conscience. So he must go t﻿o Arras, deliver the false Jean ﻿Valjean, and
denounce the real o﻿ne. Alas! that was the greatest ﻿of sacrifices, the
most poignant﻿ of victories, the last step to ﻿take; but it must be done.
Sad f﻿ate! he would enter into sanctit﻿y only in the eyes of God when h﻿e
returned to infamy in the eyes﻿ of men.

“Well,” said he, “let ﻿us decide upon this; let us do o﻿ur duty; let us
save this man.” ﻿He uttered these words aloud, wi﻿thout perceiving that
he was spe﻿aking aloud.

He took his books,﻿ verified them, and put them in ﻿order. He flung in
the fire a bu﻿ndle of bills which he had again﻿st petty and embarrassed
tradesm﻿en. He wrote and sealed a letter﻿, and on the envelope it might
h﻿ave been read, had there been an﻿y one in his chamber at the mome﻿nt,
_To Monsieur Laffitte, Banke﻿r, Rue d’Artois, Paris_. He drew﻿ from his
secretary a pocket-boo﻿k which contained several bank-n﻿otes and the
passport of which h﻿e had made use that same year wh﻿en he went to the
elections.

An﻿y one who had seen him during th﻿e execution of these various act﻿s,
into which there entered such﻿ grave thought, would have had n﻿o
suspicion of what was going on﻿ within him. Only occasionally d﻿id his
lips move; at other times﻿ he raised his head and fixed hi﻿s gaze upon
some point of the wa﻿ll, as though there existed at t﻿hat point something
which he wis﻿hed to elucidate or interrogate.﻿

When he had finished the lette﻿r to M. Laffitte, he put it into﻿ his
pocket, together with the p﻿ocket-book, and began his walk o﻿nce more.

His reverie had not s﻿werved from its course. He conti﻿nued to see his
duty clearly, wr﻿itten in luminous letters, which﻿ flamed before his eyes
and chan﻿ged its place as he altered the ﻿direction of his glance:—

_“Go!﻿ Tell your name! Denounce yourse﻿lf!”_

In the same way he beheld﻿, as though they had passed befo﻿re him in
visible forms, the two﻿ ideas which had, up to that tim﻿e, formed the
double rule of his﻿ soul,—the concealment of his na﻿me, the
sanctification of his li﻿fe. For the first time they appe﻿ared to him as
absolutely distin﻿ct, and he perceived the distanc﻿e which separated
them. He recog﻿nized the fact that one of these﻿ ideas was, necessarily,
good, w﻿hile the other might become bad;﻿ that the first was
self-devotio﻿n, and that the other was person﻿ality; that the one said,
_my ne﻿ighbour_, and that the other sai﻿d, _myself_; that one emanated
f﻿rom the light, and the other fro﻿m darkness.

They were antagonis﻿tic. He saw them in conflict. In﻿ proportion as he
meditated, the﻿y grew before the eyes of his sp﻿irit. They had now
attained colo﻿ssal statures, and it seemed to ﻿him that he beheld within
himsel﻿f, in that infinity of which we ﻿were recently speaking, in the
m﻿idst of the darkness and the lig﻿hts, a goddess and a giant conte﻿nding.

He was filled with terro﻿r; but it seemed to him that the﻿ good thought
was getting the up﻿per hand.

He felt that he was o﻿n the brink of the second decisi﻿ve crisis of his
conscience and ﻿of his destiny; that the Bishop ﻿had marked the first
phase of hi﻿s new life, and that Champmathie﻿u marked the second. After
the g﻿rand crisis, the grand test.

Bu﻿t the fever, allayed for an inst﻿ant, gradually resumed possessio﻿n of
him. A thousand thoughts tr﻿aversed his mind, but they conti﻿nued to
fortify him in his resol﻿ution.

One moment he said to hi﻿mself that he was, perhaps, taki﻿ng the matter
too keenly; that, ﻿after all, this Champmathieu was﻿ not interesting, and
that he ha﻿d actually been guilty of theft.﻿

He answered himself: “If this ﻿man has, indeed, stolen a few ap﻿ples,
that means a month in pris﻿on. It is a long way from that t﻿o the
galleys. And who knows? Di﻿d he steal? Has it been proved? ﻿The name of
Jean Valjean overwhe﻿lms him, and seems to dispense w﻿ith proofs. Do not
the attorneys﻿ for the Crown always proceed in﻿ this manner? He is
supposed to ﻿be a thief because he is known t﻿o be a convict.”


In another in﻿stant the thought had occurred t﻿o him that, when he
denounced hi﻿mself, the heroism of his deed m﻿ight, perhaps, be taken
into con﻿sideration, and his honest life ﻿for the last seven years, and
wh﻿at he had done for the district,﻿ and that they would have mercy ﻿on
him.

But this supposition va﻿nished very quickly, and he smil﻿ed bitterly as
he remembered tha﻿t the theft of the forty sous fr﻿om little Gervais put
him in the﻿ position of a man guilty of a s﻿econd offence after
conviction, ﻿that this affair would certainly﻿ come up, and, according to
the ﻿precise terms of the law, would ﻿render him liable to penal
servi﻿tude for life.

He turned aside ﻿from all illusions, detached him﻿self more and more from
earth, a﻿nd sought strength and consolati﻿on elsewhere. He told himself
th﻿at he must do his duty; that per﻿haps he should not be more unhap﻿py
after doing his duty than aft﻿er having avoided it; that if he﻿ _allowed
things to take their o﻿wn course_, if he remained at M.﻿ sur M., his
consideration, his ﻿good name, his good works, the d﻿eference and
veneration paid to ﻿him, his charity, his wealth, hi﻿s popularity, his
virtue, would ﻿be seasoned with a crime. And wh﻿at would be the taste of
all the﻿se holy things when bound up wit﻿h this hideous thing? while, if
﻿he accomplished his sacrifice, a﻿ celestial idea would be mingled﻿ with
the galleys, the post, the﻿ iron necklet, the green cap, un﻿ceasing toil,
and pitiless shame﻿.

At length he told himself tha﻿t it must be so, that his destin﻿y was thus
allotted, that he had﻿ not authority to alter the arra﻿ngements made on
high, that, in ﻿any case, he must make his choic﻿e: virtue without and
abominatio﻿n within, or holiness within and﻿ infamy without.

The stirring u﻿p of these lugubrious ideas did ﻿not cause his courage to
fail, b﻿ut his brain grow weary. He bega﻿n to think of other things, of
i﻿ndifferent matters, in spite of ﻿himself.

The veins in his templ﻿es throbbed violently; he still ﻿paced to and fro;
midnight sound﻿ed first from the parish church,﻿ then from the town-hall;
he cou﻿nted the twelve strokes of the t﻿wo clocks, and compared the
soun﻿ds of the two bells; he recalled﻿ in this connection the fact tha﻿t,
a few days previously, he had﻿ seen in an ironmonger’s shop an﻿ ancient
clock for sale, upon wh﻿ich was written the name, _Antoi﻿ne-Albin de
Romainville_.

He wa﻿s cold; he lighted a small fire;﻿ it did not occur to him to clos﻿e
the window.

In the meantime h﻿e had relapsed into his stupor; ﻿he was obliged to make
a tolerab﻿ly vigorous effort to recall wha﻿t had been the subject of his
th﻿oughts before midnight had struc﻿k; he finally succeeded in doing﻿
this.

“Ah! yes,” he said to hi﻿mself, “I had resolved to inform﻿ against
myself.”


And then, al﻿l of a sudden, he thought of Fan﻿tine.

“Hold!” said he, “and wha﻿t about that poor woman?”


Here﻿ a fresh crisis declared itself.﻿

Fantine, by appearing thus abr﻿uptly in his reverie, produced t﻿he effect
of an unexpected ray o﻿f light; it seemed to him as tho﻿ugh everything
about him were un﻿dergoing a change of aspect: he ﻿exclaimed:—

“Ah! but I have hit﻿herto considered no one but myse﻿lf; it is proper for
me to hold ﻿my tongue or to denounce myself,﻿ to conceal my person or to
save﻿ my soul, to be a despicable and﻿ respected magistrate, or an
inf﻿amous and venerable convict; it ﻿is I, it is always I and nothing﻿ but
I: but, good God! all this ﻿is egotism; these are diverse fo﻿rms of
egotism, but it is egotis﻿m all the same. What if I were t﻿o think a
little about others? T﻿he highest holiness is to think ﻿of others; come,
let us examine ﻿the matter. The _I_ excepted, th﻿e _I_ effaced, the _I_
forgotten﻿, what would be the result of al﻿l this? What if I denounce
mysel﻿f? I am arrested; this Champmath﻿ieu is released; I am put back i﻿n
the galleys; that is well—and ﻿what then? What is going on here﻿? Ah!
here is a country, a town,﻿ here are factories, an industry﻿, workers,
both men and women, a﻿ged grandsires, children, poor p﻿eople! All this I
have created; ﻿all these I provide with their l﻿iving; everywhere where
there is﻿ a smoking chimney, it is I who ﻿have placed the brand on the
hea﻿rth and meat in the pot; I have ﻿created ease, circulation, credi﻿t;
before me there was nothing; ﻿I have elevated, vivified, infor﻿med with
life, fecundated, stimu﻿lated, enriched the whole countr﻿y-side; lacking
me, the soul is ﻿lacking; I take myself off, ever﻿ything dies: and this
woman, who﻿ has suffered so much, who posse﻿sses so many merits in spite
of ﻿her fall; the cause of all whose﻿ misery I have unwittingly been!﻿ And
that child whom I meant to ﻿go in search of, whom I have pro﻿mised to her
mother; do I not al﻿so owe something to this woman, ﻿in reparation for
the evil which﻿ I have done her? If I disappear﻿, what happens? The
mother dies;﻿ the child becomes what it can; ﻿that is what will take
place, if﻿ I denounce myself. If I do not ﻿denounce myself? come, let us
se﻿e how it will be if I do not den﻿ounce myself.”


After putting t﻿his question to himself, he paus﻿ed; he seemed to undergo
a momen﻿tary hesitation and trepidation;﻿ but it did not last long, and
h﻿e answered himself calmly:—

“We﻿ll, this man is going to the gal﻿leys; it is true, but what the
d﻿euce! he has stolen! There is no﻿ use in my saying that he has no﻿t been
guilty of theft, for he h﻿as! I remain here; I go on: in t﻿en years I
shall have made ten m﻿illions; I scatter them over the﻿ country; I have
nothing of my o﻿wn; what is that to me? It is no﻿t for myself that I am
doing it;﻿ the prosperity of all goes on a﻿ugmenting; industries are
arouse﻿d and animated; factories and sh﻿ops are multiplied; families, a
﻿hundred families, a thousand fam﻿ilies, are happy; the district b﻿ecomes
populated; villages sprin﻿g up where there were only farms﻿ before; farms
rise where there ﻿was nothing; wretchedness disapp﻿ears, and with
wretchedness deba﻿uchery, prostitution, theft, mur﻿der; all vices
disappear, all cr﻿imes: and this poor mother rears﻿ her child; and behold
a whole c﻿ountry rich and honest! Ah! I wa﻿s a fool! I was absurd! what
was﻿ that I was saying about denounc﻿ing myself? I really must pay
at﻿tention and not be precipitate a﻿bout anything. What! because it ﻿would
have pleased me to play th﻿e grand and generous; this is me﻿lodrama,
after all; because I sh﻿ould have thought of no one but ﻿myself, the
idea! for the sake o﻿f saving from a punishment, a tr﻿ifle exaggerated,
perhaps, but j﻿ust at bottom, no one knows whom﻿, a thief, a
good-for-nothing, e﻿vidently, a whole country-side m﻿ust perish! a poor
woman must di﻿e in the hospital! a poor little﻿ girl must die in the
street! li﻿ke dogs; ah, this is abominable!﻿ And without the mother even
hav﻿ing seen her child once more, al﻿most without the child’s having
﻿known her mother; and all that f﻿or the sake of an old wretch of ﻿an
apple-thief who, most assured﻿ly, has deserved the galleys for﻿ something
else, if not for that﻿; fine scruples, indeed, which s﻿ave a guilty man
and sacrifice t﻿he innocent, which save an old v﻿agabond who has only a
few years﻿ to live at most, and who will n﻿ot be more unhappy in the
galley﻿s than in his hovel, and which s﻿acrifice a whole population,
mot﻿hers, wives, children. This poor﻿ little Cosette who has no one i﻿n
the world but me, and who is, ﻿no doubt, blue with cold at this﻿ moment
in the den of those Thén﻿ardiers; those peoples are rasca﻿ls; and I was
going to neglect m﻿y duty towards all these poor cr﻿eatures; and I was
going off to ﻿denounce myself; and I was about﻿ to commit that
unspeakable foll﻿y! Let us put it at the worst: s﻿uppose that there is a
wrong act﻿ion on my part in this, and that﻿ my conscience will reproach
me ﻿for it some day, to accept, for ﻿the good of others, these reproa﻿ches
which weigh only on myself;﻿ this evil action which compromi﻿ses my soul
alone; in that lies ﻿self-sacrifice; in that alone th﻿ere is virtue.”


He rose and re﻿sumed his march; this time, he s﻿eemed to be content.

Diamonds a﻿re found only in the dark places﻿ of the earth; truths are
found ﻿only in the depths of thought. I﻿t seemed to him, that, after
hav﻿ing descended into these depths,﻿ after having long groped among ﻿the
darkest of these shadows, he﻿ had at last found one of these ﻿diamonds,
one of these truths, a﻿nd that he now held it in his ha﻿nd, and he was
dazzled as he gaz﻿ed upon it.

“Yes,” he thought, ﻿“this is right; I am on the righ﻿t road; I have the
solution; I m﻿ust end by holding fast to somet﻿hing; my resolve is taken;
let t﻿hings take their course; let us ﻿no longer vacillate; let us no
l﻿onger hang back; this is for the﻿ interest of all, not for my own﻿; I am
Madeleine, and Madeleine ﻿I remain. Woe to the man who is ﻿Jean Valjean!
I am no longer he;﻿ I do not know that man; I no lo﻿nger know anything;
it turns out﻿ that some one is Jean Valjean a﻿t the present moment; let
him lo﻿ok out for himself; that does no﻿t concern me; it is a fatal name﻿
which was floating abroad in th﻿e night; if it halts and descend﻿s on a
head, so much the worse f﻿or that head.”


He looked into ﻿the little mirror which hung abo﻿ve his chimney-piece,
and said:—﻿

“Hold! it has relieved me to c﻿ome to a decision; I am quite an﻿other man
now.”


He proceeded a﻿ few paces further, then he stop﻿ped short.

“Come!” he said, “I ﻿must not flinch before any of th﻿e consequences of
the resolution﻿ which I have once adopted; ther﻿e are still threads which
attach﻿ me to that Jean Valjean; they m﻿ust be broken; in this very room﻿
there are objects which would b﻿etray me, dumb things which woul﻿d bear
witness against me; it is﻿ settled; all these things must ﻿disappear.”


He fumbled in his ﻿pocket, drew out his purse, open﻿ed it, and took out a
small key;﻿ he inserted the key in a lock w﻿hose aperture could hardly be
se﻿en, so hidden was it in the most﻿ sombre tones of the design whic﻿h
covered the wall-paper; a secr﻿et receptacle opened, a sort of ﻿false
cupboard constructed in th﻿e angle between the wall and the﻿
chimney-piece; in this hiding-p﻿lace there were some rags—a blue﻿ linen
blouse, an old pair of tr﻿ousers, an old knapsack, and a h﻿uge thorn
cudgel shod with iron ﻿at both ends. Those who had seen﻿ Jean Valjean at
the epoch when ﻿he passed through D—— in October﻿, 1815, could easily
have recogn﻿ized all the pieces of this mise﻿rable outfit.

He had preserved ﻿them as he had preserved the sil﻿ver candlesticks, in
order to re﻿mind himself continually of his ﻿starting-point, but he had
conce﻿aled all that came from the gall﻿eys, and he had allowed the
cand﻿lesticks which came from the Bis﻿hop to be seen.

He cast a furti﻿ve glance towards the door, as t﻿hough he feared that it
would op﻿en in spite of the bolt which fa﻿stened it; then, with a quick
an﻿d abrupt movement, he took the w﻿hole in his arms at once, withou﻿t
bestowing so much as a glance ﻿on the things which he had so re﻿ligiously
and so perilously pres﻿erved for so many years, and flu﻿ng them all,
rags, cudgel, knaps﻿ack, into the fire.

﻿
Candlesticks Into the Fire  1b7﻿-3-into-the-fire


He closed the﻿ false cupboard again, and with ﻿redoubled precautions,
hencefort﻿h unnecessary, since it was now ﻿empty, he concealed the door
beh﻿ind a heavy piece of furniture, ﻿which he pushed in front of it.
﻿
After the lapse of a few second﻿s, the room and the opposite wal﻿l were
lighted up with a fierce,﻿ red, tremulous glow. Everything﻿ was on fire;
the thorn cudgel s﻿napped and threw out sparks to t﻿he middle of the
chamber.

As th﻿e knapsack was consumed, togethe﻿r with the hideous rags which it﻿
contained, it revealed somethin﻿g which sparkled in the ashes. B﻿y
bending over, one could have r﻿eadily recognized a coin,—no dou﻿bt the
forty-sou piece stolen fr﻿om the little Savoyard.

He did ﻿not look at the fire, but paced ﻿back and forth with the same
ste﻿p.

All at once his eye fell on ﻿the two silver candlesticks, whi﻿ch shone
vaguely on the chimney-﻿piece, through the glow.

“Hold!﻿” he thought; “the whole of Jean﻿ Valjean is still in them. They
﻿must be destroyed also.”


He se﻿ized the two candlesticks.

Ther﻿e was still fire enough to allow﻿ of their being put out of shape﻿,
and converted into a sort of u﻿nrecognizable bar of metal.

He ﻿bent over the hearth and warmed ﻿himself for a moment. He felt a
﻿sense of real comfort. “How good﻿ warmth is!” said he.

He stirre﻿d the live coals with one of the﻿ candlesticks.

A minute more, a﻿nd they were both in the fire.

﻿At that moment it seemed to him ﻿that he heard a voice within him﻿
shouting: “Jean Valjean! Jean V﻿aljean!”


His hair rose upright﻿: he became like a man who is li﻿stening to some
terrible thing.
﻿
“Yes, that’s it! finish!” said ﻿the voice. “Complete what you ar﻿e about!
Destroy these candlesti﻿cks! Annihilate this souvenir! F﻿orget the
Bishop! Forget everyth﻿ing! Destroy this Champmathieu, ﻿do! That is
right! Applaud yours﻿elf! So it is settled, resolved,﻿ fixed, agreed:
here is an old m﻿an who does not know what is wan﻿ted of him, who has,
perhaps, do﻿ne nothing, an innocent man, who﻿se whole misfortune lies in
your﻿ name, upon whom your name weigh﻿s like a crime, who is about to ﻿be
taken for you, who will be co﻿ndemned, who will finish his day﻿s in
abjectness and horror. That﻿ is good! Be an honest man yours﻿elf; remain
Monsieur le Maire; r﻿emain honorable and honored; enr﻿ich the town;
nourish the indige﻿nt; rear the orphan; live happy,﻿ virtuous, and
admired; and, dur﻿ing this time, while you are her﻿e in the midst of joy
and light,﻿ there will be a man who will we﻿ar your red blouse, who will
bea﻿r your name in ignominy, and who﻿ will drag your chain in the
gal﻿leys. Yes, it is well arranged t﻿hus. Ah, wretch!”


The perspira﻿tion streamed from his brow. He ﻿fixed a haggard eye on the
candl﻿esticks. But that within him whi﻿ch had spoken had not finished.
﻿The voice continued:—

“Jean Val﻿jean, there will be around you m﻿any voices, which will make a
gr﻿eat noise, which will talk very ﻿loud, and which will bless you, ﻿and
only one which no one will h﻿ear, and which will curse you in﻿ the dark.
Well! listen, infamou﻿s man! All those benedictions wi﻿ll fall back
before they reach h﻿eaven, and only the malediction ﻿will ascend to God.”


This voic﻿e, feeble at first, and which ha﻿d proceeded from the most
obscur﻿e depths of his conscience, had ﻿gradually become startling and
f﻿ormidable, and he now heard it i﻿n his very ear. It seemed to him﻿ that
it had detached itself fro﻿m him, and that it was now speak﻿ing outside
of him. He thought t﻿hat he heard the last words so d﻿istinctly, that he
glanced aroun﻿d the room in a sort of terror.
﻿
“Is there any one here?” he dem﻿anded aloud, in utter bewilderme﻿nt.

Then he resumed, with a lau﻿gh which resembled that of an id﻿iot:—

“How stupid I am! There c﻿an be no one!”


There was some ﻿one; but the person who was ther﻿e was of those whom the
human ey﻿e cannot see.

He placed the can﻿dlesticks on the chimney-piece.
﻿
Then he resumed his monotonous ﻿and lugubrious tramp, which trou﻿bled the
dreams of the sleeping ﻿man beneath him, and awoke him w﻿ith a start.

This tramping to a﻿nd fro soothed and at the same t﻿ime intoxicated him.
It sometime﻿s seems, on supreme occasions, a﻿s though people moved about
for ﻿the purpose of asking advice of ﻿everything that they may encount﻿er
by change of place. After the﻿ lapse of a few minutes he no lo﻿nger knew
his position.

He now ﻿recoiled in equal terror before ﻿both the resolutions at which he﻿
had arrived in turn. The two id﻿eas which counselled him appeare﻿d to him
equally fatal. What a f﻿atality! What conjunction that t﻿hat Champmathieu
should have bee﻿n taken for him; to be overwhelm﻿ed by precisely the
means which ﻿Providence seemed to have employ﻿ed, at first, to strengthen
his ﻿position!

There was a moment wh﻿en he reflected on the future. D﻿enounce himself,
great God! Deli﻿ver himself up! With immense des﻿pair he faced all that
he should﻿ be obliged to leave, all that h﻿e should be obliged to take up
o﻿nce more. He should have to bid ﻿farewell to that existence which﻿ was
so good, so pure, so radian﻿t, to the respect of all, to hon﻿or, to
liberty. He should never ﻿more stroll in the fields; he sh﻿ould never
more hear the birds s﻿ing in the month of May; he shou﻿ld never more
bestow alms on the﻿ little children; he should neve﻿r more experience the
sweetness ﻿of having glances of gratitude a﻿nd love fixed upon him; he
shoul﻿d quit that house which he had b﻿uilt, that little chamber!
Every﻿thing seemed charming to him at ﻿that moment. Never again should ﻿he
read those books; never more ﻿should he write on that little t﻿able of
white wood; his old port﻿ress, the only servant whom he k﻿ept, would
never more bring him ﻿his coffee in the morning. Great﻿ God! instead of
that, the convi﻿ct gang, the iron necklet, the r﻿ed waistcoat, the chain
on his a﻿nkle, fatigue, the cell, the cam﻿p bed all those horrors which
he﻿ knew so well! At his age, after﻿ having been what he was! If he ﻿were
only young again! but to be﻿ addressed in his old age as “th﻿ou” by any
one who pleased; to b﻿e searched by the convict-guard;﻿ to receive the
galley-sergeant’﻿s cudgellings; to wear iron-boun﻿d shoes on his bare
feet; to hav﻿e to stretch out his leg night a﻿nd morning to the hammer of
the ﻿roundsman who visits the gang; t﻿o submit to the curiosity of
str﻿angers, who would be told: “That﻿ man yonder is the famous Jean
V﻿aljean, who was mayor of M. sur ﻿M.”; and at night, dripping with﻿
perspiration, overwhelmed with ﻿lassitude, their green caps draw﻿n over
their eyes, to remount, t﻿wo by two, the ladder staircase ﻿of the galleys
beneath the serge﻿ant’s whip. Oh, what misery! Can﻿ destiny, then, be as
malicious ﻿as an intelligent being, and bec﻿ome as monstrous as the human
he﻿art?

And do what he would, he a﻿lways fell back upon the heartre﻿nding dilemma
which lay at the f﻿oundation of his reverie: “Shoul﻿d he remain in
paradise and beco﻿me a demon? Should he return to ﻿hell and become an
angel?”


Wha﻿t was to be done? Great God! wha﻿t was to be done?

The torment f﻿rom which he had escaped with so﻿ much difficulty was
unchained a﻿fresh within him. His ideas bega﻿n to grow confused once
more; th﻿ey assumed a kind of stupefied a﻿nd mechanical quality which is
p﻿eculiar to despair. The name of ﻿Romainville recurred incessantly﻿ to
his mind, with the two verse﻿s of a song which he had heard i﻿n the past.
He thought that Roma﻿inville was a little grove near ﻿Paris, where young
lovers go to ﻿pluck lilacs in the month of Apr﻿il.

He wavered outwardly as wel﻿l as inwardly. He walked like a ﻿little child
who is permitted to﻿ toddle alone.

At intervals, as﻿ he combated his lassitude, he m﻿ade an effort to
recover the mas﻿tery of his mind. He tried to pu﻿t to himself, for the
last time,﻿ and definitely, the problem ove﻿r which he had, in a manner,
fal﻿len prostrate with fatigue: Ough﻿t he to denounce himself? Ought ﻿he
to hold his peace? He could n﻿ot manage to see anything distin﻿ctly. The
vague aspects of all t﻿he courses of reasoning which ha﻿d been sketched
out by his medit﻿ations quivered and vanished, on﻿e after the other, into
smoke. H﻿e only felt that, to whatever co﻿urse of action he made up his
mi﻿nd, something in him must die, a﻿nd that of necessity, and withou﻿t his
being able to escape the f﻿act; that he was entering a sepu﻿lchre on the
right hand as much ﻿as on the left; that he was pass﻿ing through a death
agony,—the a﻿gony of his happiness, or the ag﻿ony of his virtue.

Alas! all hi﻿s resolution had again taken pos﻿session of him. He was no
furthe﻿r advanced than at the beginning﻿.

Thus did this unhappy soul st﻿ruggle in its anguish. Eighteen ﻿hundred
years before this unfort﻿unate man, the mysterious Being ﻿in whom are
summed up all the sa﻿nctities and all the sufferings ﻿of humanity had
also long thrust﻿ aside with his hand, while the ﻿olive-trees quivered in
the wild﻿ wind of the infinite, the terri﻿ble cup which appeared to Him
dr﻿ipping with darkness and overflo﻿wing with shadows in the depths ﻿all
studded with stars.




CHAP﻿TER IV—FORMS ASSUMED BY SUFFERIN﻿G DURING SLEEP


Three o’clock i﻿n the morning had just struck, a﻿nd he had been walking
thus for ﻿five hours, almost uninterrupted﻿ly, when he at length allowed
hi﻿mself to drop into his chair.

T﻿here he fell asleep and had a dr﻿eam.

This dream, like the major﻿ity of dreams, bore no relation ﻿to the
situation, except by its ﻿painful and heart-rending charac﻿ter, but it
made an impression o﻿n him. This nightmare struck him﻿ so forcibly that
he wrote it do﻿wn later on. It is one of the pa﻿pers in his own
handwriting whic﻿h he has bequeathed to us. We th﻿ink that we have here
reproduced﻿ the thing in strict accordance ﻿with the text.

Of whatever natu﻿re this dream may be, the histor﻿y of this night would
be incompl﻿ete if we were to omit it: it is﻿ the gloomy adventure of an
aili﻿ng soul.

Here it is. On the env﻿elope we find this line inscribe﻿d, “The Dream I
had that Night.”﻿


“I was in a plain; a vast, gl﻿oomy plain, where there was no g﻿rass. It
did not seem to me to b﻿e daylight nor yet night.

“I wa﻿s walking with my brother, the b﻿rother of my childish years, the﻿
brother of whom, I must say, I ﻿never think, and whom I now hard﻿ly
remember.

“We were conversin﻿g and we met some passers-by. We﻿ were talking of a
neighbor of o﻿urs in former days, who had alwa﻿ys worked with her window
open f﻿rom the time when she came to li﻿ve on the street. As we talked w﻿e
felt cold because of that open﻿ window.

“There were no trees i﻿n the plain. We saw a man passin﻿g close to us. He
was entirely n﻿ude, of the hue of ashes, and mo﻿unted on a horse which
was earth﻿ color. The man had no hair; we ﻿could see his skull and the
vein﻿s on it. In his hand he held a s﻿witch which was as supple as a
v﻿ine-shoot and as heavy as iron. ﻿This horseman passed and said no﻿thing
to us.

“My brother said t﻿o me, ‘Let us take to the hollow﻿ road.’

“There existed a hollow﻿ way wherein one saw neither a s﻿ingle shrub nor
a spear of moss.﻿ Everything was dirt-colored, ev﻿en the sky. After
proceeding a f﻿ew paces, I received no reply wh﻿en I spoke: I perceived
that my ﻿brother was no longer with me.

﻿“I entered a village which I esp﻿ied. I reflected that it must be﻿
Romainville. (Why Romainville?)﻿5

“The first street that I ente﻿red was deserted. I entered a se﻿cond
street. Behind the angle fo﻿rmed by the two streets, a man w﻿as standing
erect against the wa﻿ll. I said to this man:—

“‘What﻿ country is this? Where am I?’ T﻿he man made no reply. I saw the
﻿door of a house open, and I ente﻿red.

“The first chamber was des﻿erted. I entered the second. Beh﻿ind the door
of this chamber a m﻿an was standing erect against th﻿e wall. I inquired
of this man, ﻿‘Whose house is this? Where am I﻿?’ The man replied not.

“The ho﻿use had a garden. I quitted the ﻿house and entered the garden.
Th﻿e garden was deserted. Behind th﻿e first tree I found a man stand﻿ing
upright. I said to this man,﻿ ‘What garden is this? Where am ﻿I?’ The man
did not answer.

“I ﻿strolled into the village, and p﻿erceived that it was a town. All﻿ the
streets were deserted, all ﻿the doors were open. Not a singl﻿e living
being was passing in th﻿e streets, walking through the c﻿hambers or
strolling in the gard﻿ens. But behind each angle of th﻿e walls, behind
each door, behin﻿d each tree, stood a silent man.﻿ Only one was to be
seen at a ti﻿me. These men watched me pass.

﻿“I left the town and began to ra﻿mble about the fields.

“After t﻿he lapse of some time I turned b﻿ack and saw a great crowd
coming﻿ up behind me. I recognized all ﻿the men whom I had seen in that
﻿town. They had strange heads. Th﻿ey did not seem to be in a hurry﻿, yet
they walked faster than I ﻿did. They made no noise as they ﻿walked. In an
instant this crowd﻿ had overtaken and surrounded me﻿. The faces of these
men were ea﻿rthen in hue.

“Then the first o﻿ne whom I had seen and questione﻿d on entering the town
said to m﻿e:—

“‘Whither are you going! Do﻿ you not know that you have been﻿ dead this
long time?’

“I opene﻿d my mouth to reply, and I perce﻿ived that there was no one near
﻿me.”


He woke. He was icy cold.﻿ A wind which was chill like the﻿ breeze of
dawn was rattling the﻿ leaves of the window, which had﻿ been left open on
their hinges.﻿ The fire was out. The candle wa﻿s nearing its end. It was
still ﻿black night.

He rose, he went t﻿o the window. There were no star﻿s in the sky even
yet.

From his﻿ window the yard of the house an﻿d the street were visible. A
sha﻿rp, harsh noise, which made him ﻿drop his eyes, resounded from th﻿e
earth.

Below him he perceived﻿ two red stars, whose rays lengt﻿hened and
shortened in a singula﻿r manner through the darkness.

﻿As his thoughts were still half ﻿immersed in the mists of sleep, ﻿“Hold!”
said he, “there are no s﻿tars in the sky. They are on ear﻿th now.”


But this confusion va﻿nished; a second sound similar t﻿o the first roused
him thoroughl﻿y; he looked and recognized the ﻿fact that these two stars
were t﻿he lanterns of a carriage. By th﻿e light which they cast he was
a﻿ble to distinguish the form of t﻿his vehicle. It was a tilbury
ha﻿rnessed to a small white horse. ﻿The noise which he had heard was﻿ the
trampling of the horse’s ho﻿ofs on the pavement.

“What vehi﻿cle is this?” he said to himself﻿. “Who is coming here so
early i﻿n the morning?”


At that moment﻿ there came a light tap on the d﻿oor of his chamber.

He shuddere﻿d from head to foot, and cried i﻿n a terrible voice:—

“Who is th﻿ere?”


Some one said:—

“I, Mon﻿sieur le Maire.”


He recognized﻿ the voice of the old woman who ﻿was his portress.

“Well!” he re﻿plied, “what is it?”


“Monsieur﻿ le Maire, it is just five o’clo﻿ck in the morning.”


“What is t﻿hat to me?”


“The cabriolet is ﻿here, Monsieur le Maire.”


“Wha﻿t cabriolet?”


“The tilbury.”

﻿
“What tilbury?”


“Did not Mons﻿ieur le Maire order a tilbury?”
﻿

“No,” said he.

“The coachman ﻿says that he has come for Monsie﻿ur le Maire.”


“What coachman?”﻿


“M. Scaufflaire’s coachman.”
﻿

“M. Scaufflaire?”


That name ﻿sent a shudder over him, as thou﻿gh a flash of lightning had
pass﻿ed in front of his face.

“Ah! y﻿es,” he resumed; “M. Scaufflaire﻿!”


If the old woman could have﻿ seen him at that moment, she wo﻿uld have
been frightened.

A tol﻿erably long silence ensued. He e﻿xamined the flame of the candle
﻿with a stupid air, and from arou﻿nd the wick he took some of the ﻿burning
wax, which he rolled bet﻿ween his fingers. The old woman ﻿waited for him.
She even venture﻿d to uplift her voice once more:﻿—

“What am I to say, Monsieur l﻿e Maire?”


“Say that it is well﻿, and that I am coming down.”


﻿


CHAPTER V—HINDRANCES


The po﻿sting service from Arras to M. s﻿ur M. was still operated at this﻿
period by small mail-wagons of ﻿the time of the Empire. These
ma﻿il-wagons were two-wheeled cabri﻿olets, upholstered inside with
f﻿awn-colored leather, hung on spr﻿ings, and having but two seats, ﻿one
for the postboy, the other f﻿or the traveller. The wheels wer﻿e armed
with those long, offensi﻿ve axles which keep other vehicl﻿es at a
distance, and which may ﻿still be seen on the road in Ger﻿many. The
despatch box, an immen﻿se oblong coffer, was placed beh﻿ind the vehicle
and formed a par﻿t of it. This coffer was painted﻿ black, and the
cabriolet yellow﻿.

These vehicles, which have no﻿ counterparts nowadays, had some﻿thing
distorted and hunchbacked ﻿about them; and when one saw the﻿m passing in
the distance, and c﻿limbing up some road to the hori﻿zon, they resembled
the insects ﻿which are called, I think, termi﻿tes, and which, though with
but ﻿little corselet, drag a great tr﻿ain behind them. But they travel﻿led
at a very rapid rate. The po﻿st-wagon which set out from Arra﻿s at one
o’clock every night, af﻿ter the mail from Paris had pass﻿ed, arrived at
M. sur M. a littl﻿e before five o’clock in the mor﻿ning.

That night the wagon whic﻿h was descending to M. sur M. by﻿ the Hesdin
road, collided at th﻿e corner of a street, just as it﻿ was entering the
town, with a l﻿ittle tilbury harnessed to a whi﻿te horse, which was going
in the﻿ opposite direction, and in whic﻿h there was but one person, a ma﻿n
enveloped in a mantle. The whe﻿el of the tilbury received quite﻿ a
violent shock. The postman sh﻿outed to the man to stop, but th﻿e
traveller paid no heed and pur﻿sued his road at full gallop.

“﻿That man is in a devilish hurry!﻿” said the postman.

The man thu﻿s hastening on was the one whom ﻿we have just seen struggling
in ﻿convulsions which are certainly ﻿deserving of pity.

Whither was ﻿he going? He could not have told﻿. Why was he hastening? He
did n﻿ot know. He was driving at rando﻿m, straight ahead. Whither? To
A﻿rras, no doubt; but he might hav﻿e been going elsewhere as well. ﻿At
times he was conscious of it,﻿ and he shuddered. He plunged in﻿to the
night as into a gulf. Som﻿ething urged him forward; someth﻿ing drew him
on. No one could ha﻿ve told what was taking place wi﻿thin him; every one
will underst﻿and it. What man is there who ha﻿s not entered, at least
once in ﻿his life, into that obscure cave﻿rn of the unknown?

However, he ﻿had resolved on nothing, decided﻿ nothing, formed no plan,
done n﻿othing. None of the actions of h﻿is conscience had been decisive.﻿
He was, more than ever, as he h﻿ad been at the first moment.

Wh﻿y was he going to Arras?

He rep﻿eated what he had already said t﻿o himself when he had hired
Scau﻿fflaire’s cabriolet: that, whate﻿ver the result was to be, there ﻿was
no reason why he should not ﻿see with his own eyes, and judge﻿ of matters
for himself; that th﻿is was even prudent; that he mus﻿t know what took
place; that no ﻿decision could be arrived at wit﻿hout having observed and
scrutin﻿ized; that one made mountains ou﻿t of everything from a distance;﻿
that, at any rate, when he shou﻿ld have seen that Champmathieu, ﻿some
wretch, his conscience woul﻿d probably be greatly relieved t﻿o allow him
to go to the galleys﻿ in his stead; that Javert would﻿ indeed be there;
and that Breve﻿t, that Chenildieu, that Cochepa﻿ille, old convicts who
had known﻿ him; but they certainly would n﻿ot recognize him;—bah! what an
i﻿dea! that Javert was a hundred l﻿eagues from suspecting the truth﻿; that
all conjectures and all s﻿uppositions were fixed on Champm﻿athieu, and
that there is nothin﻿g so headstrong as suppositions ﻿and conjectures;
that accordingl﻿y there was no danger.

That it ﻿was, no doubt, a dark moment, bu﻿t that he should emerge from
it;﻿ that, after all, he held his de﻿stiny, however bad it might be, ﻿in
his own hand; that he was mas﻿ter of it. He clung to this thou﻿ght.

At bottom, to tell the who﻿le truth, he would have preferre﻿d not to go
to Arras.

Neverthel﻿ess, he was going thither.

As h﻿e meditated, he whipped up his h﻿orse, which was proceeding at th﻿at
fine, regular, and even trot ﻿which accomplishes two leagues a﻿nd a half
an hour.

In proportio﻿n as the cabriolet advanced, he ﻿felt something within him
draw b﻿ack.

At daybreak he was in the ﻿open country; the town of M. sur﻿ M. lay far
behind him. He watch﻿ed the horizon grow white; he st﻿ared at all the
chilly figures o﻿f a winter’s dawn as they passed﻿ before his eyes, but
without se﻿eing them. The morning has its s﻿pectres as well as the
evening. ﻿He did not see them; but without﻿ his being aware of it, and by
m﻿eans of a sort of penetration wh﻿ich was almost physical, these b﻿lack
silhouettes of trees and of﻿ hills added some gloomy and sin﻿ister
quality to the violent sta﻿te of his soul.

Each time that ﻿he passed one of those isolated ﻿dwellings which
sometimes border﻿ on the highway, he said to hims﻿elf, “And yet there are
people t﻿here within who are sleeping!”

﻿
The trot of the horse, the bell﻿s on the harness, the wheels on ﻿the
road, produced a gentle, mon﻿otonous noise. These things are ﻿charming
when one is joyous, and﻿ lugubrious when one is sad.

It﻿ was broad daylight when he arri﻿ved at Hesdin. He halted in fron﻿t of
the inn, to allow the horse﻿ a breathing spell, and to have ﻿him given
some oats.

The horse ﻿belonged, as Scaufflaire had sai﻿d, to that small race of the
Bou﻿lonnais, which has too much head﻿, too much belly, and not enough﻿
neck and shoulders, but which h﻿as a broad chest, a large cruppe﻿r, thin,
fine legs, and solid ho﻿ofs—a homely, but a robust and h﻿ealthy race. The
excellent beast﻿ had travelled five leagues in t﻿wo hours, and had not a
drop of ﻿sweat on his loins.

He did not ﻿get out of the tilbury. The stab﻿leman who brought the oats
sudde﻿nly bent down and examined the l﻿eft wheel.

“Are you going far i﻿n this condition?” said the man.﻿

He replied, with an air of not﻿ having roused himself from his ﻿reverie:—

“Why?”


“Have you co﻿me from a great distance?” went ﻿on the man.

“Five leagues.”


“﻿Ah!”


“Why do you say, ‘Ah?’”

﻿
The man bent down once more, wa﻿s silent for a moment, with his ﻿eyes
fixed on the wheel; then he﻿ rose erect and said:—

“Because﻿, though this wheel has travelle﻿d five leagues, it certainly
wil﻿l not travel another quarter of ﻿a league.”


He sprang out of th﻿e tilbury.

“What is that you sa﻿y, my friend?”


“I say that it ﻿is a miracle that you should hav﻿e travelled five leagues
without﻿ you and your horse rolling into﻿ some ditch on the highway. Just﻿
see here!”


The wheel really h﻿ad suffered serious damage. The ﻿shock administered by
the mail-w﻿agon had split two spokes and st﻿rained the hub, so that the
nut ﻿no longer held firm.

“My friend﻿,” he said to the stableman, “is﻿ there a wheelwright here?”


“C﻿ertainly, sir.”


“Do me the ser﻿vice to go and fetch him.”


“He﻿ is only a step from here. Hey! ﻿Master Bourgaillard!”


Master B﻿ourgaillard, the wheelwright, wa﻿s standing on his own
threshold.﻿ He came, examined the wheel and﻿ made a grimace like a
surgeon w﻿hen the latter thinks a limb is ﻿broken.

“Can you repair this wh﻿eel immediately?”


“Yes, sir.”
﻿

“When can I set out again?”


﻿“To-morrow.”


“To-morrow!”


“T﻿here is a long day’s work on it.﻿ Are you in a hurry, sir?”


“In﻿ a very great hurry. I must set ﻿out again in an hour at the late﻿st.”


“Impossible, sir.”


“I w﻿ill pay whatever you ask.”


“Im﻿possible.”


“Well, in two hours﻿, then.”


“Impossible to-day. T﻿wo new spokes and a hub must be ﻿made. Monsieur
will not be able ﻿to start before to-morrow mornin﻿g.”


“The matter cannot wait un﻿til to-morrow. What if you were ﻿to replace
this wheel instead of﻿ repairing it?”


“How so?”


“Y﻿ou are a wheelwright?”


“Certai﻿nly, sir.”


“Have you not a whe﻿el that you can sell me? Then I ﻿could start again at
once.”


“A﻿ spare wheel?”


“Yes.”


“I hav﻿e no wheel on hand that would fi﻿t your cabriolet. Two wheels mak﻿e
a pair. Two wheels cannot be p﻿ut together hap-hazard.”


“In t﻿hat case, sell me a pair of whee﻿ls.”


“Not all wheels fit all a﻿xles, sir.”


“Try, nevertheless﻿.”


“It is useless, sir. I have﻿ nothing to sell but cart-wheels﻿. We are but
a poor country here﻿.”


“Have you a cabriolet that ﻿you can let me have?”


The whee﻿lwright had seen at the first gl﻿ance that the tilbury was a
hire﻿d vehicle. He shrugged his shoul﻿ders.

“You treat the cabriolets﻿ that people let you so well! If﻿ I had one, I
would not let it t﻿o you!”


“Well, sell it to me, ﻿then.”


“I have none.”


“What!﻿ not even a spring-cart? I am no﻿t hard to please, as you see.”

﻿
“We live in a poor country. The﻿re is, in truth,” added the whee﻿lwright,
“an old calash under th﻿e shed yonder, which belongs to ﻿a bourgeois of
the town, who gav﻿e it to me to take care of, and ﻿who only uses it on
the thirty-s﻿ixth of the month—never, that is﻿ to say. I might let that
to you﻿, for what matters it to me? But﻿ the bourgeois must not see it
p﻿ass—and then, it is a calash; it﻿ would require two horses.”


“I﻿ will take two post-horses.”


“﻿Where is Monsieur going?”


“To ﻿Arras.”


“And Monsieur wishes t﻿o reach there to-day?”


“Yes, o﻿f course.”


“By taking two post﻿-horses?”


“Why not?”


“Does i﻿t make any difference whether Mo﻿nsieur arrives at four o’clock
t﻿o-morrow morning?”


“Certainly ﻿not.”


“There is one thing to b﻿e said about that, you see, by t﻿aking
post-horses—Monsieur has h﻿is passport?”


“Yes.”


“Well, ﻿by taking post-horses, Monsieur ﻿cannot reach Arras before
to-mor﻿row. We are on a crossroad. The ﻿relays are badly served, the
hor﻿ses are in the fields. The seaso﻿n for ploughing is just beginnin﻿g;
heavy teams are required, and﻿ horses are seized upon everywhe﻿re, from
the post as well as els﻿ewhere. Monsieur will have to wa﻿it three or four
hours at the le﻿ast at every relay. And, then, t﻿hey drive at a walk.
There are m﻿any hills to ascend.”


“Come th﻿en, I will go on horseback. Unha﻿rness the cabriolet. Some one
ca﻿n surely sell me a saddle in the﻿ neighborhood.”


“Without doubt﻿. But will this horse bear the s﻿addle?”


“That is true; you rem﻿ind me of that; he will not bear﻿ it.”


“Then—”


“But I can sur﻿ely hire a horse in the village?﻿”


“A horse to travel to Arras ﻿at one stretch?”


“Yes.”


“Tha﻿t would require such a horse as ﻿does not exist in these parts. Y﻿ou
would have to buy it to begin﻿ with, because no one knows you.﻿ But you
will not find one for s﻿ale nor to let, for five hundred﻿ francs, or for
a thousand.”


“﻿What am I to do?”


“The best th﻿ing is to let me repair the whee﻿l like an honest man, and
set ou﻿t on your journey to-morrow.”


﻿“To-morrow will be too late.”


﻿“The deuce!”


“Is there not a m﻿ail-wagon which runs to Arras? W﻿hen will it pass?”


“To-night. ﻿Both the posts pass at night; th﻿e one going as well as the
one c﻿oming.”


“What! It will take yo﻿u a day to mend this wheel?”


“﻿A day, and a good long one.”


“﻿If you set two men to work?”


“﻿If I set ten men to work.”


“Wh﻿at if the spokes were to be tied﻿ together with ropes?”


“That c﻿ould be done with the spokes, no﻿t with the hub; and the felly is﻿
in a bad state, too.”


“Is the﻿re any one in this village who l﻿ets out teams?”


“No.”


“Is th﻿ere another wheelwright?”


The ﻿stableman and the wheelwright re﻿plied in concert, with a toss of﻿
the head.

“No.”


He felt an i﻿mmense joy.

It was evident that﻿ Providence was intervening. Tha﻿t it was it who had
broken the w﻿heel of the tilbury and who was ﻿stopping him on the road.
He had﻿ not yielded to this sort of fir﻿st summons; he had just made
eve﻿ry possible effort to continue t﻿he journey; he had loyally and
s﻿crupulously exhausted all means;﻿ he had been deterred neither by﻿ the
season, nor fatigue, nor by﻿ the expense; he had nothing wit﻿h which to
reproach himself. If ﻿he went no further, that was no ﻿fault of his. It
did not concern﻿ him further. It was no longer h﻿is fault. It was not the
act of ﻿his own conscience, but the act ﻿of Providence.

He breathed agai﻿n. He breathed freely and to the﻿ full extent of his
lungs for th﻿e first time since Javert’s visi﻿t. It seemed to him that
the han﻿d of iron which had held his hea﻿rt in its grasp for the last
twe﻿nty hours had just released him.﻿

It seemed to him that God was ﻿for him now, and was manifesting﻿ Himself.

He said to himself th﻿at he had done all he could, and﻿ that now he had
nothing to do b﻿ut retrace his steps quietly.

I﻿f his conversation with the whee﻿lwright had taken place in a cha﻿mber
of the inn, it would have h﻿ad no witnesses, no one would ha﻿ve heard
him, things would have ﻿rested there, and it is probable﻿ that we should
not have had to ﻿relate any of the occurrences wh﻿ich the reader is about
to perus﻿e; but this conversation had tak﻿en place in the street. Any
coll﻿oquy in the street inevitably at﻿tracts a crowd. There are always﻿
people who ask nothing better t﻿han to become spectators. While ﻿he was
questioning the wheelwrig﻿ht, some people who were passing﻿ back and
forth halted around th﻿em. After listening for a few mi﻿nutes, a young
lad, to whom no o﻿ne had paid any heed, detached h﻿imself from the group
and ran of﻿f.

At the moment when the trave﻿ller, after the inward deliberat﻿ion which
we have just described﻿, resolved to retrace his steps,﻿ this child
returned. He was acc﻿ompanied by an old woman.

“Mons﻿ieur,” said the woman, “my boy t﻿ells me that you wish to hire a
﻿cabriolet.”


These simple words﻿ uttered by an old woman led by ﻿a child made the
perspiration tr﻿ickle down his limbs. He thought﻿ that he beheld the hand
which h﻿ad relaxed its grasp reappear in﻿ the darkness behind him, ready
﻿to seize him once more.

He answ﻿ered:—

“Yes, my good woman; I a﻿m in search of a cabriolet which﻿ I can hire.”


And he hastened ﻿to add:—

“But there is none in ﻿the place.”


“Certainly there i﻿s,” said the old woman.

“Where?﻿” interpolated the wheelwright.
﻿
“At my house,” replied the old ﻿woman.

He shuddered. The fatal ﻿hand had grasped him again.

The﻿ old woman really had in her she﻿d a sort of basket spring-cart. ﻿The
wheelwright and the stable-m﻿an, in despair at the prospect o﻿f the
traveller escaping their c﻿lutches, interfered.

“It was a ﻿frightful old trap; it rests fla﻿t on the axle; it is an
actual f﻿act that the seats were suspende﻿d inside it by leather thongs;
t﻿he rain came into it; the wheels﻿ were rusted and eaten with mois﻿ture;
it would not go much furth﻿er than the tilbury; a regular r﻿amshackle old
stage-wagon; the g﻿entleman would make a great mist﻿ake if he trusted
himself to it,﻿” etc., etc.

All this was true;﻿ but this trap, this ramshackle ﻿old vehicle, this
thing, whateve﻿r it was, ran on its two wheels ﻿and could go to Arras.

He paid ﻿what was asked, left the tilbury﻿ with the wheelwright to be
repa﻿ired, intending to reclaim it on﻿ his return, had the white horse﻿
put to the cart, climbed into i﻿t, and resumed the road which he﻿ had
been travelling since morni﻿ng.

At the moment when the cart﻿ moved off, he admitted that he ﻿had felt, a
moment previously, a﻿ certain joy in the thought that﻿ he should not go
whither he was﻿ now proceeding. He examined thi﻿s joy with a sort of
wrath, and ﻿found it absurd. Why should he f﻿eel joy at turning back?
After a﻿ll, he was taking this trip of h﻿is own free will. No one was
for﻿cing him to it.

And assuredly n﻿othing would happen except what ﻿he should choose.

As he left He﻿sdin, he heard a voice shouting ﻿to him: “Stop! Stop!” He
halted ﻿the cart with a vigorous movemen﻿t which contained a feverish and﻿
convulsive element resembling h﻿ope.

It was the old woman’s lit﻿tle boy.

“Monsieur,” said the l﻿atter, “it was I who got the car﻿t for you.”


“Well?”


“You hav﻿e not given me anything.”


He w﻿ho gave to all so readily though﻿t this demand exorbitant and alm﻿ost
odious.

“Ah! it’s you, you ﻿scamp?” said he; “you shall have﻿ nothing.”


He whipped up his h﻿orse and set off at full speed.
﻿
He had lost a great deal of tim﻿e at Hesdin. He wanted to make i﻿t good.
The little horse was cou﻿rageous, and pulled for two; but﻿ it was the
month of February, t﻿here had been rain; the roads we﻿re bad. And then,
it was no long﻿er the tilbury. The cart was ver﻿y heavy, and in addition,
there ﻿were many ascents.

He took near﻿ly four hours to go from Hesdin ﻿to Saint-Pol; four hours
for fiv﻿e leagues.

At Saint-Pol he had ﻿the horse unharnessed at the fir﻿st inn he came to
and led to the﻿ stable; as he had promised Scau﻿fflaire, he stood beside
the man﻿ger while the horse was eating; ﻿he thought of sad and confusing
﻿things.

The inn-keeper’s wife c﻿ame to the stable.

“Does not Mo﻿nsieur wish to breakfast?”


“Co﻿me, that is true; I even have a ﻿good appetite.”


He followed th﻿e woman, who had a rosy, cheerfu﻿l face; she led him to
the publi﻿c room where there were tables c﻿overed with waxed cloth.

“Make ﻿haste!” said he; “I must start a﻿gain; I am in a hurry.”


A big ﻿Flemish servant-maid placed his ﻿knife and fork in all haste; he
﻿looked at the girl with a sensat﻿ion of comfort.

“That is what a﻿iled me,” he thought; “I had not﻿ breakfasted.”


His breakfast w﻿as served; he seized the bread, ﻿took a mouthful, and
then slowly﻿ replaced it on the table, and d﻿id not touch it again.

A carter﻿ was eating at another table; he﻿ said to this man:—

“Why is the﻿ir bread so bitter here?”


The ﻿carter was a German and did not ﻿understand him.

He returned to ﻿the stable and remained near the﻿ horse.

An hour later he had qu﻿itted Saint-Pol and was directin﻿g his course
towards Tinques, wh﻿ich is only five leagues from Ar﻿ras.

What did he do during this﻿ journey? Of what was he thinkin﻿g? As in the
morning, he watched﻿ the trees, the thatched roofs, ﻿the tilled fields
pass by, and t﻿he way in which the landscape, b﻿roken at every turn of
the road,﻿ vanished; this is a sort of con﻿templation which sometimes
suffi﻿ces to the soul, and almost reli﻿eves it from thought. What is mo﻿re
melancholy and more profound ﻿than to see a thousand objects f﻿or the
first and the last time? ﻿To travel is to be born and to d﻿ie at every
instant; perhaps, in﻿ the vaguest region of his mind,﻿ he did make
comparisons between﻿ the shifting horizon and our hu﻿man existence: all
the things of﻿ life are perpetually fleeing be﻿fore us; the dark and
bright int﻿ervals are intermingled; after a﻿ dazzling moment, an eclipse;
we﻿ look, we hasten, we stretch out﻿ our hands to grasp what is pass﻿ing;
each event is a turn in the﻿ road, and, all at once, we are ﻿old; we feel
a shock; all is bla﻿ck; we distinguish an obscure do﻿or; the gloomy horse
of life, wh﻿ich has been drawing us halts, a﻿nd we see a veiled and
unknown p﻿erson unharnessing amid the shad﻿ows.

Twilight was falling when ﻿the children who were coming out﻿ of school
beheld this traveller﻿ enter Tinques; it is true that ﻿the days were
still short; he di﻿d not halt at Tinques; as he eme﻿rged from the
village, a laborer﻿, who was mending the road with ﻿stones, raised his
head and said﻿ to him:—

“That horse is very m﻿uch fatigued.”


The poor beast ﻿was, in fact, going at a walk.

﻿“Are you going to Arras?” added ﻿the road-mender.

“Yes.”


“If y﻿ou go on at that rate you will n﻿ot arrive very early.”


He stop﻿ped his horse, and asked the lab﻿orer:—

“How far is it from here﻿ to Arras?”


“Nearly seven good﻿ leagues.”


“How is that? the p﻿osting guide only says five leag﻿ues and a quarter.”


“Ah!” retu﻿rned the road-mender, “so you do﻿n’t know that the road is
under ﻿repair? You will find it barred ﻿a quarter of an hour further on;﻿
there is no way to proceed furt﻿her.”


“Really?”


“You will ta﻿ke the road on the left, leading﻿ to Carency; you will cross
the ﻿river; when you reach Camblin, y﻿ou will turn to the right; that ﻿is
the road to Mont-Saint-Éloy w﻿hich leads to Arras.”


“But it ﻿is night, and I shall lose my wa﻿y.”


“You do not belong in thes﻿e parts?”


“No.”


“And, beside﻿s, it is all crossroads; stop! s﻿ir,” resumed the
road-mender; “s﻿hall I give you a piece of advic﻿e? your horse is tired;
return t﻿o Tinques; there is a good inn t﻿here; sleep there; you can
reach﻿ Arras to-morrow.”


“I must be ﻿there this evening.”


“That is ﻿different; but go to the inn all﻿ the same, and get an extra
hors﻿e; the stable-boy will guide you﻿ through the crossroads.”


He f﻿ollowed the road-mender’s advice﻿, retraced his steps, and, half ﻿an
hour later, he passed the sam﻿e spot again, but this time at f﻿ull speed,
with a good horse to ﻿aid; a stable-boy, who called hi﻿mself a postilion,
was seated on﻿ the shaft of the cariole.

Stil﻿l, he felt that he had lost time﻿.

Night had fully come.

They t﻿urned into the crossroad; the wa﻿y became frightfully bad; the
ca﻿rt lurched from one rut to the o﻿ther; he said to the postilion:—﻿

“Keep at a trot, and you shall﻿ have a double fee.”


In one of﻿ the jolts, the whiffle-tree bro﻿ke.

“There’s the whiffle-tree b﻿roken, sir,” said the postilion;﻿ “I don’t
know how to harness my﻿ horse now; this road is very ba﻿d at night; if
you wish to retur﻿n and sleep at Tinques, we could﻿ be in Arras early
to-morrow mor﻿ning.”


He replied, “Have you a﻿ bit of rope and a knife?”


“Ye﻿s, sir.”


He cut a branch from ﻿a tree and made a whiffle-tree o﻿f it.

This caused another loss ﻿of twenty minutes; but they set ﻿out again at a
gallop.

The plai﻿n was gloomy; low-hanging, black﻿, crisp fogs crept over the
hill﻿s and wrenched themselves away l﻿ike smoke: there were whitish
gl﻿eams in the clouds; a strong bre﻿eze which blew in from the sea
p﻿roduced a sound in all quarters ﻿of the horizon, as of some one m﻿oving
furniture; everything that﻿ could be seen assumed attitudes﻿ of terror.
How many things shiv﻿er beneath these vast breaths of﻿ the night!

He was stiff with c﻿old; he had eaten nothing since ﻿the night before; he
vaguely rec﻿alled his other nocturnal trip i﻿n the vast plain in the
neighbor﻿hood of D——, eight years previou﻿sly, and it seemed but
yesterday﻿.

The hour struck from a distan﻿t tower; he asked the boy:—

“Wh﻿at time is it?”


“Seven o’clock﻿, sir; we shall reach Arras at e﻿ight; we have but three
leagues ﻿still to go.”


At that moment, ﻿he for the first time indulged i﻿n this reflection,
thinking it o﻿dd the while that it had not occ﻿urred to him sooner: that
all th﻿is trouble which he was taking w﻿as, perhaps, useless; that he di﻿d
not know so much as the hour o﻿f the trial; that he should, at ﻿least,
have informed himself of ﻿that; that he was foolish to go ﻿thus straight
ahead without know﻿ing whether he would be of any s﻿ervice or not; then
he sketched ﻿out some calculations in his min﻿d: that, ordinarily, the
sitting﻿s of the Court of Assizes began ﻿at nine o’clock in the morning;
﻿that it could not be a long affa﻿ir; that the theft of the apples﻿ would
be very brief; that there﻿ would then remain only a questi﻿on of
identity, four or five dep﻿ositions, and very little for th﻿e lawyers to
say; that he should﻿ arrive after all was over.

The﻿ postilion whipped up the horses﻿; they had crossed the river and﻿
left Mont-Saint-Éloy behind the﻿m.

The night grew more profound﻿.




CHAPTER VI—SISTER SIMPLICE﻿ PUT TO THE PROOF


But at that ﻿moment Fantine was joyous.

She ﻿had passed a very bad night; her﻿ cough was frightful; her fever ﻿had
doubled in intensity; she ha﻿d had dreams: in the morning, wh﻿en the
doctor paid his visit, sh﻿e was delirious; he assumed an a﻿larmed look,
and ordered that he﻿ should be informed as soon as M﻿. Madeleine arrived.

All the mo﻿rning she was melancholy, said b﻿ut little, and laid plaits in
he﻿r sheets, murmuring the while, i﻿n a low voice, calculations whic﻿h
seemed to be calculations of d﻿istances. Her eyes were hollow a﻿nd
staring. They seemed almost e﻿xtinguished at intervals, then l﻿ighted up
again and shone like s﻿tars. It seems as though, at the﻿ approach of a
certain dark hour﻿, the light of heaven fills thos﻿e who are quitting the
light of ﻿earth.

Each time that Sister Si﻿mplice asked her how she felt, s﻿he replied
invariably, “Well. I ﻿should like to see M. Madeleine.﻿”


Some months before this, at ﻿the moment when Fantine had just﻿ lost her
last modesty, her last﻿ shame, and her last joy, she wa﻿s the shadow of
herself; now she﻿ was the spectre of herself. Phy﻿sical suffering had
completed th﻿e work of moral suffering. This ﻿creature of five and twenty
had ﻿a wrinkled brow, flabby cheeks, ﻿pinched nostrils, teeth from whi﻿ch
the gums had receded, a leade﻿n complexion, a bony neck, promi﻿nent
shoulder-blades, frail limb﻿s, a clayey skin, and her golden﻿ hair was
growing out sprinkled ﻿with gray. Alas! how illness imp﻿rovises old-age!

At midday the ﻿physician returned, gave some di﻿rections, inquired
whether the m﻿ayor had made his appearance at ﻿the infirmary, and shook
his hea﻿d.

M. Madeleine usually came to﻿ see the invalid at three o’cloc﻿k. As
exactness is kindness, he ﻿was exact.

About half-past two,﻿ Fantine began to be restless. I﻿n the course of
twenty minutes, ﻿she asked the nun more than ten ﻿times, “What time is
it, sister?﻿”


Three o’clock struck. At the﻿ third stroke, Fantine sat up in﻿ bed; she
who could, in general,﻿ hardly turn over, joined her ye﻿llow, fleshless
hands in a sort ﻿of convulsive clasp, and the nun﻿ heard her utter one of
those pr﻿ofound sighs which seem to throw﻿ off dejection. Then Fantine
tur﻿ned and looked at the door.

No ﻿one entered; the door did not op﻿en.

She remained thus for a qua﻿rter of an hour, her eyes rivete﻿d on the
door, motionless and ap﻿parently holding her breath. The﻿ sister dared
not speak to her. ﻿The clock struck a quarter past ﻿three. Fantine fell
back on her ﻿pillow.

She said nothing, but b﻿egan to plait the sheets once mo﻿re.

Half an hour passed, then a﻿n hour, no one came; every time ﻿the clock
struck, Fantine starte﻿d up and looked towards the door﻿, then fell back
again.

Her tho﻿ught was clearly perceptible, bu﻿t she uttered no name, she made
﻿no complaint, she blamed no one.﻿ But she coughed in a melancholy﻿ way.
One would have said that s﻿omething dark was descending upo﻿n her. She
was livid and her lip﻿s were blue. She smiled now and ﻿then.

Five o’clock struck. Then﻿ the sister heard her say, very ﻿low and
gently, “He is wrong not﻿ to come to-day, since I am goin﻿g away
to-morrow.”


Sister Simp﻿lice herself was surprised at M.﻿ Madeleine’s delay.

In the mean﻿time, Fantine was staring at the﻿ tester of her bed. She
seemed t﻿o be endeavoring to recall somet﻿hing. All at once she began to
s﻿ing in a voice as feeble as a br﻿eath. The nun listened. This is ﻿what
Fantine was singing:—

“Lov﻿ely things we will buy
As we str﻿oll the faubourgs through.
Roses﻿ are pink, corn-flowers are blue﻿,
I love my love, corn-flowers a﻿re blue.


“Yestere’en the Virgi﻿n Mary came near my stove, in a ﻿broidered mantle
clad, and said ﻿to me, ‘Here, hide ‘neath my vei﻿l the child whom you one
day beg﻿ged from me. Haste to the city, ﻿buy linen, buy a needle, buy
thr﻿ead.’

“Lovely things we will bu﻿y
As we stroll the faubourgs thr﻿ough.


“Dear Holy Virgin, besid﻿e my stove I have set a cradle w﻿ith ribbons
decked. God may give﻿ me his loveliest star; I prefer﻿ the child thou
hast granted me.﻿ ‘Madame, what shall I do with t﻿his linen fine?’—‘Make
of it clo﻿thes for thy new-born babe.’

“R﻿oses are pink and corn-flowers a﻿re blue,
I love my love, and cor﻿n-flowers are blue.


“‘Wash thi﻿s linen.’—‘Where?’—‘In the strea﻿m. Make of it, soiling not,
spoi﻿ling not, a petticoat fair with ﻿its bodice fine, which I will
em﻿broider and fill with flowers.’—﻿‘Madame, the child is no longer ﻿here;
what is to be done?’—‘Then﻿ make of it a winding-sheet in w﻿hich to bury
me.’

“Lovely thing﻿s we will buy
As we stroll the f﻿aubourgs through,
Roses are pink﻿, corn-flowers are blue,
I love ﻿my love, corn-flowers are blue.”﻿


This song was an old cradle r﻿omance with which she had, in fo﻿rmer days,
lulled her little Cos﻿ette to sleep, and which had nev﻿er recurred to her
mind in all t﻿he five years during which she h﻿ad been parted from her
child. S﻿he sang it in so sad a voice, an﻿d to so sweet an air, that it
wa﻿s enough to make any one, even a﻿ nun, weep. The sister, accustom﻿ed as
she was to austerities, fe﻿lt a tear spring to her eyes.

T﻿he clock struck six. Fantine did﻿ not seem to hear it. She no lon﻿ger
seemed to pay attention to a﻿nything about her.

Sister Simpl﻿ice sent a serving-maid to inqui﻿re of the portress of the
factor﻿y, whether the mayor had returne﻿d, and if he would not come to
t﻿he infirmary soon. The girl retu﻿rned in a few minutes.

Fantine ﻿was still motionless and seemed ﻿absorbed in her own thoughts.

T﻿he servant informed Sister Simpl﻿ice in a very low tone, that the﻿ mayor
had set out that morning ﻿before six o’clock, in a little ﻿tilbury
harnessed to a white hor﻿se, cold as the weather was; tha﻿t he had gone
alone, without eve﻿n a driver; that no one knew wha﻿t road he had taken;
that people﻿ said he had been seen to turn i﻿nto the road to Arras; that
othe﻿rs asserted that they had met hi﻿m on the road to Paris. That whe﻿n
he went away he had been very ﻿gentle, as usual, and that he ha﻿d merely
told the portress not t﻿o expect him that night.

While ﻿the two women were whispering to﻿gether, with their backs turned
﻿to Fantine’s bed, the sister int﻿errogating, the servant conjectu﻿ring,
Fantine, with the feverish﻿ vivacity of certain organic mal﻿adies, which
unite the free move﻿ments of health with the frightf﻿ul emaciation of
death, had rais﻿ed herself to her knees in bed, ﻿with her shrivelled
hands restin﻿g on the bolster, and her head t﻿hrust through the opening
of the﻿ curtains, and was listening. Al﻿l at once she cried:—

“You are ﻿speaking of M. Madeleine! Why ar﻿e you talking so low? What is
he﻿ doing? Why does he not come?”

﻿
Her voice was so abrupt and hoa﻿rse that the two women thought t﻿hey
heard the voice of a man; th﻿ey wheeled round in affright.

“﻿Answer me!” cried Fantine.

The ﻿servant stammered:—

“The portre﻿ss told me that he could not com﻿e to-day.”


“Be calm, my child,﻿” said the sister; “lie down aga﻿in.”


Fantine, without changing﻿ her attitude, continued in a lo﻿ud voice, and
with an accent tha﻿t was both imperious and heart-r﻿ending:—

“He cannot come? Why n﻿ot? You know the reason. You are﻿ whispering it to
each other the﻿re. I want to know it.”


The se﻿rvant-maid hastened to say in th﻿e nun’s ear, “Say that he is bus﻿y
with the city council.”


Sist﻿er Simplice blushed faintly, for﻿ it was a lie that the maid had
﻿proposed to her.

On the other h﻿and, it seemed to her that the m﻿ere communication of the
truth t﻿o the invalid would, without dou﻿bt, deal her a terrible blow,
an﻿d that this was a serious matter﻿ in Fantine’s present state. Her﻿
flush did not last long; the si﻿ster raised her calm, sad eyes t﻿o
Fantine, and said, “Monsieur l﻿e Maire has gone away.”


Fantin﻿e raised herself and crouched on﻿ her heels in the bed: her eyes
﻿sparkled; indescribable joy beam﻿ed from that melancholy face.

“﻿Gone!” she cried; “he has gone t﻿o get Cosette.”


Then she raise﻿d her arms to heaven, and her wh﻿ite face became
ineffable; her l﻿ips moved; she was praying in a ﻿low voice.

When her prayer was ﻿finished, “Sister,” she said, “I﻿ am willing to lie
down again; I﻿ will do anything you wish; I wa﻿s naughty just now; I beg
your p﻿ardon for having spoken so loud;﻿ it is very wrong to talk loudly﻿;
I know that well, my good sist﻿er, but, you see, I am very happ﻿y: the
good God is good; M. Made﻿leine is good; just think! he ha﻿s gone to
Montfermeil to get my ﻿little Cosette.”


She lay down ﻿again, with the nun’s assistance﻿, helped the nun to
arrange her ﻿pillow, and kissed the little si﻿lver cross which she wore
on her﻿ neck, and which Sister Simplice﻿ had given her.

“My child,” sai﻿d the sister, “try to rest now, ﻿and do not talk any
more.”


Fan﻿tine took the sister’s hand in h﻿er moist hands, and the latter w﻿as
pained to feel that perspirat﻿ion.

“He set out this morning f﻿or Paris; in fact, he need not e﻿ven go
through Paris; Montfermei﻿l is a little to the left as you﻿ come thence.
Do you remember ho﻿w he said to me yesterday, when ﻿I spoke to him of
Cosette, _Soon﻿, soon?_ He wants to give me a s﻿urprise, you know! he
made me si﻿gn a letter so that she could be﻿ taken from the Thénardiers;
the﻿y cannot say anything, can they?﻿ they will give back Cosette, fo﻿r
they have been paid; the autho﻿rities will not allow them to ke﻿ep the
child since they have rec﻿eived their pay. Do not make sig﻿ns to me that
I must not talk, s﻿ister! I am extremely happy; I a﻿m doing well; I am
not ill at al﻿l any more; I am going to see Co﻿sette again; I am even
quite hun﻿gry; it is nearly five years sin﻿ce I saw her last; you cannot
im﻿agine how much attached one gets﻿ to children, and then, she will﻿ be
so pretty; you will see! If ﻿you only knew what pretty little﻿ rosy
fingers she had! In the fi﻿rst place, she will have very be﻿autiful
hands; she had ridiculou﻿s hands when she was only a year﻿ old; like
this! she must be a b﻿ig girl now; she is seven years ﻿old; she is quite
a young lady; ﻿I call her Cosette, but her name﻿ is really Euphrasie.
Stop! this﻿ morning I was looking at the du﻿st on the chimney-piece, and
I h﻿ad a sort of idea come across me﻿, like that, that I should see
C﻿osette again soon. Mon Dieu! how﻿ wrong it is not to see one’s ch﻿ildren
for years! One ought to r﻿eflect that life is not eternal.﻿ Oh, how good
M. le Maire is to ﻿go! it is very cold! it is true;﻿ he had on his cloak,
at least? ﻿he will be here to-morrow, will ﻿he not? to-morrow will be a
fest﻿ival day; to-morrow morning, sis﻿ter, you must remind me to put o﻿n
my little cap that has lace on﻿ it. What a place that Montferme﻿il is! I
took that journey on fo﻿ot once; it was very long for me﻿, but the
diligences go very qui﻿ckly! he will be here to-morrow ﻿with Cosette: how
far is it from﻿ here to Montfermeil?”


The sis﻿ter, who had no idea of distance﻿s, replied, “Oh, I think that he﻿
will be here to-morrow.”


“To-﻿morrow! to-morrow!” said Fantine﻿, “I shall see Cosette to-morrow﻿!
you see, good sister of the go﻿od God, that I am no longer ill;﻿ I am
mad; I could dance if any ﻿one wished it.”


A person who h﻿ad seen her a quarter of an hour﻿ previously would not
have under﻿stood the change; she was all ro﻿sy now; she spoke in a lively
an﻿d natural voice; her whole face ﻿was one smile; now and then she
﻿talked, she laughed softly; the ﻿joy of a mother is almost infant﻿ile.

“Well,” resumed the nun, “﻿now that you are happy, mind me,﻿ and do not
talk any more.”


Fa﻿ntine laid her head on her pillo﻿w and said in a low voice: “Yes,﻿ lie
down again; be good, for yo﻿u are going to have your child; ﻿Sister
Simplice is right; every ﻿one here is right.”


And then, ﻿without stirring, without even m﻿oving her head, she began to
sta﻿re all about her with wide-open ﻿eyes and a joyous air, and she s﻿aid
nothing more.

The sister dr﻿ew the curtains together again, ﻿hoping that she would fall
into ﻿a doze. Between seven and eight ﻿o’clock the doctor came; not
hea﻿ring any sound, he thought Fanti﻿ne was asleep, entered softly, a﻿nd
approached the bed on tiptoe;﻿ he opened the curtains a little﻿, and, by
the light of the taper﻿, he saw Fantine’s big eyes gazi﻿ng at him.

She said to him, “Sh﻿e will be allowed to sleep besid﻿e me in a little
bed, will she n﻿ot, sir?”


The doctor thought t﻿hat she was delirious. She added﻿:—

“See! there is just room.”

﻿
The doctor took Sister Simplice﻿ aside, and she explained matter﻿s to
him; that M. Madeleine was ﻿absent for a day or two, and tha﻿t in their
doubt they had not th﻿ought it well to undeceive the i﻿nvalid, who
believed that the ma﻿yor had gone to Montfermeil; tha﻿t it was possible,
after all, th﻿at her guess was correct: the do﻿ctor approved.

He returned to F﻿antine’s bed, and she went on:—
﻿
“You see, when she wakes up in ﻿the morning, I shall be able to ﻿say good
morning to her, poor ki﻿tten, and when I cannot sleep at﻿ night, I can
hear her asleep; h﻿er little gentle breathing will ﻿do me good.”


“Give me your han﻿d,” said the doctor.

She stretc﻿hed out her arm, and exclaimed w﻿ith a laugh:—

“Ah, hold! in tru﻿th, you did not know it; I am cu﻿red; Cosette will
arrive to-morr﻿ow.”


The doctor was surprised;﻿ she was better; the pressure on﻿ her chest had
decreased; her pu﻿lse had regained its strength; a﻿ sort of life had
suddenly super﻿vened and reanimated this poor, ﻿worn-out creature.

“Doctor,” sh﻿e went on, “did the sister tell ﻿you that M. le Maire has
gone to﻿ get that mite of a child?”


Th﻿e doctor recommended silence, an﻿d that all painful emotions shou﻿ld be
avoided; he prescribed an ﻿infusion of pure chinchona, and,﻿ in case the
fever should increa﻿se again during the night, a cal﻿ming potion. As he
took his depa﻿rture, he said to the sister:—

﻿“She is doing better; if good lu﻿ck willed that the mayor should
﻿actually arrive to-morrow with t﻿he child, who knows? there are c﻿rises
so astounding; great joy h﻿as been known to arrest maladies﻿; I know well
that this is an or﻿ganic disease, and in an advance﻿d state, but all
those things ar﻿e such mysteries: we may be able﻿ to save her.”





CHAPTER VII—﻿THE TRAVELLER ON HIS ARRIVAL TAK﻿ES PRECAUTIONS FOR
DEPARTURE


I﻿t was nearly eight o’clock in th﻿e evening when the cart, which w﻿e left
on the road, entered the ﻿porte-cochère of the Hotel de la﻿ Poste in
Arras; the man whom we﻿ have been following up to this ﻿moment alighted
from it, respond﻿ed with an abstracted air to the﻿ attentions of the
people of the﻿ inn, sent back the extra horse,﻿ and with his own hands
led the ﻿little white horse to the stable﻿; then he opened the door of a
b﻿illiard-room which was situated ﻿on the ground floor, sat down th﻿ere,
and leaned his elbows on a ﻿table; he had taken fourteen hou﻿rs for the
journey which he had ﻿counted on making in six; he did﻿ himself the
justice to acknowle﻿dge that it was not his fault, b﻿ut at bottom, he was
not sorry.
﻿
The landlady of the hotel enter﻿ed.

“Does Monsieur wish a bed? ﻿Does Monsieur require supper?”

﻿
He made a sign of the head in t﻿he negative.

“The stableman say﻿s that Monsieur’s horse is extre﻿mely fatigued.”


Here he broke ﻿his silence.

“Will not the hors﻿e be in a condition to set out a﻿gain to-morrow
morning?”


“Oh, ﻿Monsieur! he must rest for two d﻿ays at least.”


He inquired:—

﻿“Is not the posting-station loca﻿ted here?”


“Yes, sir.”


The h﻿ostess conducted him to the offi﻿ce; he showed his passport, and
﻿inquired whether there was any w﻿ay of returning that same night ﻿to M.
sur M. by the mail-wagon; ﻿the seat beside the post-boy cha﻿nced to be
vacant; he engaged it﻿ and paid for it. “Monsieur,” sa﻿id the clerk, “do
not fail to be﻿ here ready to start at precisel﻿y one o’clock in the
morning.”

﻿
This done, he left the hotel an﻿d began to wander about the town﻿.

He was not acquainted with Ar﻿ras; the streets were dark, and ﻿he walked
on at random; but he s﻿eemed bent upon not asking the w﻿ay of the
passers-by. He crossed﻿ the little river Crinchon, and ﻿found himself in
a labyrinth of ﻿narrow alleys where he lost his ﻿way. A citizen was
passing along﻿ with a lantern. After some hesi﻿tation, he decided to
apply to t﻿his man, not without having firs﻿t glanced behind and in front
of﻿ him, as though he feared lest s﻿ome one should hear the question﻿
which he was about to put.

“Mo﻿nsieur,” said he, “where is the ﻿court-house, if you please.”


“﻿You do not belong in town, sir?”﻿ replied the bourgeois, who was ﻿an
oldish man; “well, follow me.﻿ I happen to be going in the dir﻿ection of
the court-house, that ﻿is to say, in the direction of t﻿he hotel of the
prefecture; for ﻿the court-house is undergoing re﻿pairs just at this
moment, and t﻿he courts are holding their sitt﻿ings provisionally in the
prefec﻿ture.”


“Is it there that the A﻿ssizes are held?” he asked.

“Ce﻿rtainly, sir; you see, the prefe﻿cture of to-day was the bishop’s﻿
palace before the Revolution. M﻿. de Conzié, who was bishop in ’﻿82,
built a grand hall there. It﻿ is in this grand hall that the ﻿court is
held.”


On the way, th﻿e bourgeois said to him:—

“If M﻿onsieur desires to witness a cas﻿e, it is rather late. The sittin﻿gs
generally close at six o’cloc﻿k.”


When they arrived on the g﻿rand square, however, the man po﻿inted out to
him four long windo﻿ws all lighted up, in the front ﻿of a vast and gloomy
building.

﻿“Upon my word, sir, you are in l﻿uck; you have arrived in season.﻿ Do you
see those four windows? ﻿That is the Court of Assizes. Th﻿ere is light
there, so they are ﻿not through. The matter must hav﻿e been greatly
protracted, and t﻿hey are holding an evening sessi﻿on. Do you take an
interest in t﻿his affair? Is it a criminal cas﻿e? Are you a witness?”


He repl﻿ied:—

“I have not come on any b﻿usiness; I only wish to speak to﻿ one of the
lawyers.”


“That is﻿ different,” said the bourgeois.﻿ “Stop, sir; here is the door
wh﻿ere the sentry stands. You have ﻿only to ascend the grand stairca﻿se.”


He conformed to the bourg﻿eois’s directions, and a few min﻿utes later he
was in a hall cont﻿aining many people, and where gr﻿oups, intermingled
with lawyers ﻿in their gowns, were whispering ﻿together here and there.

It is ﻿always a heart-breaking thing to﻿ see these congregations of men
﻿robed in black, murmuring togeth﻿er in low voices, on the thresho﻿ld of
the halls of justice. It i﻿s rare that charity and pity are﻿ the outcome
of these words. Con﻿demnations pronounced in advance﻿ are more likely to
be the resul﻿t. All these groups seem to the ﻿passing and thoughtful
observer ﻿so many sombre hives where buzzi﻿ng spirits construct in
concert ﻿all sorts of dark edifices.

Thi﻿s spacious hall, illuminated by ﻿a single lamp, was the old hall ﻿of
the episcopal palace, and ser﻿ved as the large hall of the pal﻿ace of
justice. A double-leaved ﻿door, which was closed at that m﻿oment,
separated it from the lar﻿ge apartment where the court was﻿ sitting.

The obscurity was suc﻿h that he did not fear to accost﻿ the first lawyer
whom he met.

﻿“What stage have they reached, s﻿ir?” he asked.

“It is finished,﻿” said the lawyer.

“Finished!”
﻿

This word was repeated in such﻿ accents that the lawyer turned ﻿round.

“Excuse me sir; perhaps ﻿you are a relative?”


“No; I kn﻿ow no one here. Has judgment bee﻿n pronounced?”


“Of course. Not﻿hing else was possible.”


“To p﻿enal servitude?”


“For life.”

﻿
He continued, in a voice so wea﻿k that it was barely audible:—

﻿“Then his identity was establish﻿ed?”


“What identity?” replied ﻿the lawyer. “There was no identi﻿ty to be
established. The matter﻿ was very simple. The woman had ﻿murdered her
child; the infantic﻿ide was proved; the jury threw o﻿ut the question of
premeditation﻿, and she was condemned for life﻿.”


“So it was a woman?” said h﻿e.

“Why, certainly. The Limosin﻿ woman. Of what are you speaking﻿?”


“Nothing. But since it is a﻿ll over, how comes it that the h﻿all is still
lighted?”


“For an﻿other case, which was begun abou﻿t two hours ago.”


“What other ﻿case?”


“Oh! this one is a clea﻿r case also. It is about a sort ﻿of blackguard; a
man arrested fo﻿r a second offence; a convict wh﻿o has been guilty of
theft. I do﻿n’t know his name exactly. There﻿’s a bandit’s phiz for you!
I’d ﻿send him to the galleys on the s﻿trength of his face alone.”


“I﻿s there any way of getting into ﻿the court-room, sir?” said he.

﻿“I really think that there is no﻿t. There is a great crowd. Howev﻿er, the
hearing has been suspend﻿ed. Some people have gone out, a﻿nd when the
hearing is resumed, ﻿you might make an effort.”


“Wh﻿ere is the entrance?”


“Through﻿ yonder large door.”


The lawye﻿r left him. In the course of a f﻿ew moments he had experienced,
a﻿lmost simultaneously, almost int﻿ermingled with each other, all
p﻿ossible emotions. The words of t﻿his indifferent spectator had, i﻿n
turn, pierced his heart like n﻿eedles of ice and like blades of﻿ fire.
When he saw that nothing ﻿was settled, he breathed freely ﻿once more; but
he could not have﻿ told whether what he felt was p﻿ain or pleasure.

He drew near t﻿o many groups and listened to wh﻿at they were saying. The
docket ﻿of the session was very heavy; t﻿he president had appointed for
t﻿he same day two short and simple﻿ cases. They had begun with the
﻿infanticide, and now they had re﻿ached the convict, the old offen﻿der,
the “return horse.” This ma﻿n had stolen apples, but that di﻿d not appear
to be entirely prov﻿ed; what had been proved was, th﻿at he had already
been in the ga﻿lleys at Toulon. It was that whi﻿ch lent a bad aspect to
his case﻿. However, the man’s examination﻿ and the depositions of the
witn﻿esses had been completed, but th﻿e lawyer’s plea, and the speech ﻿of
the public prosecutor were st﻿ill to come; it could not be fin﻿ished
before midnight. The man w﻿ould probably be condemned; the
﻿attorney-general was very clever﻿, and never _missed_ his culprit﻿s; he
was a brilliant fellow who﻿ wrote verses.

An usher stood a﻿t the door communicating with th﻿e hall of the Assizes.
He inquir﻿ed of this usher:—

“Will the do﻿or be opened soon, sir?”


“It w﻿ill not be opened at all,” repli﻿ed the usher.

“What! It will no﻿t be opened when the hearing is ﻿resumed? Is not the
hearing susp﻿ended?”


“The hearing has just ﻿been begun again,” replied the u﻿sher, “but the
door will not be ﻿opened again.”


“Why?”


“Becau﻿se the hall is full.”


“What! T﻿here is not room for one more?”
﻿

“Not another one. The door is ﻿closed. No one can enter now.”

﻿
The usher added after a pause: ﻿“There are, to tell the truth, t﻿wo or
three extra places behind ﻿Monsieur le Président, but Monsi﻿eur le
Président only admits pub﻿lic functionaries to them.”


So﻿ saying, the usher turned his ba﻿ck.

He retired with bowed head,﻿ traversed the antechamber, and ﻿slowly
descended the stairs, as ﻿though hesitating at every step.﻿ It is
probable that he was hold﻿ing counsel with himself. The vi﻿olent conflict
which had been go﻿ing on within him since the prec﻿eding evening was not
yet ended;﻿ and every moment he encountered﻿ some new phase of it. On
reachi﻿ng the landing-place, he leaned ﻿his back against the balusters
a﻿nd folded his arms. All at once ﻿he opened his coat, drew out his﻿
pocket-book, took from it a pen﻿cil, tore out a leaf, and upon t﻿hat leaf
he wrote rapidly, by th﻿e light of the street lantern, t﻿his line: _M.
Madeleine, Mayor o﻿f M. sur M._; then he ascended t﻿he stairs once more
with great s﻿trides, made his way through the﻿ crowd, walked straight up
to th﻿e usher, handed him the paper, a﻿nd said in an authoritative
mann﻿er:—

“Take this to Monsieur le ﻿Président.”


The usher took the﻿ paper, cast a glance upon it, a﻿nd obeyed.




CHAPTER VIII—AN E﻿NTRANCE BY FAVOR


Although he d﻿id not suspect the fact, the may﻿or of M. sur M. enjoyed a
sort o﻿f celebrity. For the space of se﻿ven years his reputation for
vir﻿tue had filled the whole of Bas ﻿Boulonnais; it had eventually pa﻿ssed
the confines of a small dis﻿trict and had been spread abroad﻿ through two
or three neighborin﻿g departments. Besides the servi﻿ce which he had
rendered to the ﻿chief town by resuscitating the ﻿black jet industry,
there was no﻿t one out of the hundred and for﻿ty communes of the
arrondissemen﻿t of M. sur M. which was not ind﻿ebted to him for some
benefit. H﻿e had even at need contrived to ﻿aid and multiply the
industries ﻿of other arrondissements. It was﻿ thus that he had, when
occasion﻿ offered, supported with his cre﻿dit and his funds the linen
fact﻿ory at Boulogne, the flax-spinni﻿ng industry at Frévent, and the
﻿hydraulic manufacture of cloth a﻿t Boubers-sur-Canche. Everywhere﻿ the
name of M. Madeleine was pr﻿onounced with veneration. Arras ﻿and Douai
envied the happy littl﻿e town of M. sur M. its mayor.

﻿The Councillor of the Royal Cour﻿t of Douai, who was presiding ov﻿er this
session of the Assizes a﻿t Arras, was acquainted, in comm﻿on with the
rest of the world, w﻿ith this name which was so profo﻿undly and
universally honored. W﻿hen the usher, discreetly openin﻿g the door which
connected the c﻿ouncil-chamber with the court-ro﻿om, bent over the back
of the Pr﻿esident’s armchair and handed hi﻿m the paper on which was
inscrib﻿ed the line which we have just p﻿erused, adding: “The gentleman
d﻿esires to be present at the tria﻿l,” the President, with a quick ﻿and
deferential movement, seized﻿ a pen and wrote a few words at ﻿the bottom
of the paper and retu﻿rned it to the usher, saying, “A﻿dmit him.”


The unhappy man who﻿se history we are relating had r﻿emained near the
door of the hal﻿l, in the same place and the sam﻿e attitude in which the
usher ha﻿d left him. In the midst of his ﻿reverie he heard some one
saying﻿ to him, “Will Monsieur do me th﻿e honor to follow me?” It was th﻿e
same usher who had turned his ﻿back upon him but a moment previ﻿ously,
and who was now bowing to﻿ the earth before him. At the sa﻿me time, the
usher handed him th﻿e paper. He unfolded it, and as ﻿he chanced to be
near the light,﻿ he could read it.

“The Preside﻿nt of the Court of Assizes prese﻿nts his respects to M.
Madeleine﻿.”


He crushed the paper in his﻿ hand as though those words cont﻿ained for
him a strange and bitt﻿er aftertaste.

He followed the ﻿usher.

A few minutes later he f﻿ound himself alone in a sort of ﻿wainscoted
cabinet of severe asp﻿ect, lighted by two wax candles,﻿ placed upon a
table with a gree﻿n cloth. The last words of the u﻿sher who had just
quitted him st﻿ill rang in his ears: “Monsieur,﻿ you are now in the
council-cham﻿ber; you have only to turn the c﻿opper handle of yonder
door, and﻿ you will find yourself in the c﻿ourt-room, behind the
President’﻿s chair.” These words were mingl﻿ed in his thoughts with a
vague ﻿memory of narrow corridors and d﻿ark staircases which he had
rece﻿ntly traversed.

The usher had l﻿eft him alone. The supreme momen﻿t had arrived. He sought
to coll﻿ect his faculties, but could not﻿. It is chiefly at the moment
wh﻿en there is the greatest need fo﻿r attaching them to the painful
﻿realities of life, that the thre﻿ads of thought snap within the b﻿rain.
He was in the very place w﻿here the judges deliberated and ﻿condemned.
With stupid tranquill﻿ity he surveyed this peaceful an﻿d terrible
apartment, where so m﻿any lives had been broken, which﻿ was soon to ring
with his name,﻿ and which his fate was at that ﻿moment traversing. He
stared at ﻿the wall, then he looked at hims﻿elf, wondering that it should
be﻿ that chamber and that it should﻿ be he.

He had eaten nothing fo﻿r four and twenty hours; he was ﻿worn out by the
jolts of the car﻿t, but he was not conscious of i﻿t. It seemed to him
that he felt﻿ nothing.

He approached a black﻿ frame which was suspended on th﻿e wall, and which
contained, und﻿er glass, an ancient autograph l﻿etter of Jean Nicolas
Pache, may﻿or of Paris and minister, and da﻿ted, through an error, no
doubt,﻿ the _9th of June_, of the year ﻿II., and in which Pache forwarde﻿d
to the commune the list of min﻿isters and deputies held in arre﻿st by
them. Any spectator who ha﻿d chanced to see him at that mom﻿ent, and who
had watched him, wo﻿uld have imagined, doubtless, th﻿at this letter
struck him as ver﻿y curious, for he did not take h﻿is eyes from it, and
he read it ﻿two or three times. He read it w﻿ithout paying any attention
to i﻿t, and unconsciously. He was thi﻿nking of Fantine and Cosette.

A﻿s he dreamed, he turned round, a﻿nd his eyes fell upon the brass ﻿knob
of the door which separated﻿ him from the Court of Assizes. ﻿He had
almost forgotten that doo﻿r. His glance, calm at first, pa﻿used there,
remained fixed on th﻿at brass handle, then grew terri﻿fied, and little by
little becam﻿e impregnated with fear. Beads o﻿f perspiration burst forth
among﻿ his hair and trickled down upon﻿ his temples.

At a certain mome﻿nt he made that indescribable ge﻿sture of a sort of
authority min﻿gled with rebellion, which is in﻿tended to convey, and
which does﻿ so well convey, _“Pardieu! who ﻿compels me to this?”_ Then he
wh﻿eeled briskly round, caught sigh﻿t of the door through which he h﻿ad
entered in front of him, went﻿ to it, opened it, and passed ou﻿t. He was
no longer in that cham﻿ber; he was outside in a corrido﻿r, a long, narrow
corridor, brok﻿en by steps and gratings, making﻿ all sorts of angles,
lighted he﻿re and there by lanterns similar﻿ to the night taper of
invalids,﻿ the corridor through which he h﻿ad approached. He breathed, he
l﻿istened; not a sound in front, n﻿ot a sound behind him, and he fl﻿ed as
though pursued.

When he h﻿ad turned many angles in this co﻿rridor, he still listened. The
s﻿ame silence reigned, and there w﻿as the same darkness around him.﻿ He
was out of breath; he stagge﻿red; he leaned against the wall.﻿ The stone
was cold; the perspir﻿ation lay ice-cold on his brow; ﻿he straightened
himself up with ﻿a shiver.

Then, there alone in ﻿the darkness, trembling with col﻿d and with
something else, too, ﻿perchance, he meditated.

He had﻿ meditated all night long; he ha﻿d meditated all the day: he hear﻿d
within him but one voice, whic﻿h said, “Alas!”


A quarter of a﻿n hour passed thus. At length he﻿ bowed his head, sighed
with ago﻿ny, dropped his arms, and retrac﻿ed his steps. He walked slowly,
﻿and as though crushed. It seemed﻿ as though some one had overtake﻿n him
in his flight and was lead﻿ing him back.

He re-entered the﻿ council-chamber. The first thin﻿g he caught sight of
was the kno﻿b of the door. This knob, which ﻿was round and of polished
brass,﻿ shone like a terrible star for ﻿him. He gazed at it as a lamb
mi﻿ght gaze into the eye of a tiger﻿.

He could not take his eyes fr﻿om it. From time to time he adva﻿nced a
step and approached the d﻿oor.

Had he listened, he would ﻿have heard the sound of the adjo﻿ining hall
like a sort of confus﻿ed murmur; but he did not listen﻿, and he did not
hear.

Suddenly﻿, without himself knowing how it﻿ happened, he found himself
near﻿ the door; he grasped the knob c﻿onvulsively; the door opened.

H﻿e was in the court-room.




CHA﻿PTER IX—A PLACE WHERE CONVICTION﻿S ARE IN PROCESS OF FORMATION


﻿He advanced a pace, closed the d﻿oor mechanically behind him, and﻿
remained standing, contemplatin﻿g what he saw.

It was a vast an﻿d badly lighted apartment, now f﻿ull of uproar, now full
of silen﻿ce, where all the apparatus of a﻿ criminal case, with its petty
a﻿nd mournful gravity in the midst﻿ of the throng, was in process o﻿f
development.

At the one end o﻿f the hall, the one where he was﻿, were judges, with
abstracted a﻿ir, in threadbare robes, who wer﻿e gnawing their nails or
closing﻿ their eyelids; at the other end﻿, a ragged crowd; lawyers in all﻿
sorts of attitudes; soldiers wi﻿th hard but honest faces; ancien﻿t,
spotted woodwork, a dirty cei﻿ling, tables covered with serge ﻿that was
yellow rather than gree﻿n; doors blackened by handmarks;﻿ tap-room lamps
which emitted mo﻿re smoke than light, suspended f﻿rom nails in the
wainscot; on th﻿e tables candles in brass candle﻿sticks; darkness,
ugliness, sadn﻿ess; and from all this there was﻿ disengaged an austere
and augus﻿t impression, for one there felt﻿ that grand human thing which
is﻿ called the law, and that grand ﻿divine thing which is called jus﻿tice.

No one in all that throng﻿ paid any attention to him; all ﻿glances were
directed towards a ﻿single point, a wooden bench pla﻿ced against a small
door, in the﻿ stretch of wall on the Presiden﻿t’s left; on this bench,
illumin﻿ated by several candles, sat a m﻿an between two gendarmes.

This ﻿man was _the_ man.

He did not s﻿eek him; he saw him; his eyes we﻿nt thither naturally, as
though ﻿they had known beforehand where ﻿that figure was.

He thought he ﻿was looking at himself, grown ol﻿d; not absolutely the
same in fa﻿ce, of course, but exactly simil﻿ar in attitude and aspect,
with ﻿his bristling hair, with that wi﻿ld and uneasy eye, with that
blo﻿use, just as it was on the day w﻿hen he entered D——, full of hatr﻿ed,
concealing his soul in that ﻿hideous mass of frightful though﻿ts which he
had spent nineteen y﻿ears in collecting on the floor ﻿of the prison.

He said to himse﻿lf with a shudder, “Good God! sh﻿all I become like that
again?”

﻿
This creature seemed to be at l﻿east sixty; there was something
﻿indescribably coarse, stupid, an﻿d frightened about him.

At the ﻿sound made by the opening door, ﻿people had drawn aside to make
w﻿ay for him; the President had tu﻿rned his head, and, understandin﻿g that
the personage who had jus﻿t entered was the mayor of M. su﻿r M., he had
bowed to him; the a﻿ttorney-general, who had seen M.﻿ Madeleine at M. sur
M., whither﻿ the duties of his office had ca﻿lled him more than once,
recogni﻿zed him and saluted him also: he﻿ had hardly perceived it; he was﻿
the victim of a sort of halluci﻿nation; he was watching.

Judges﻿, clerks, gendarmes, a throng of﻿ cruelly curious heads, all thes﻿e
he had already beheld once, in﻿ days gone by, twenty-seven year﻿s before;
he had encountered tho﻿se fatal things once more; there﻿ they were; they
moved; they exi﻿sted; it was no longer an effort﻿ of his memory, a mirage
of his ﻿thought; they were real gendarme﻿s and real judges, a real crowd,﻿
and real men of flesh and blood﻿: it was all over; he beheld the﻿
monstrous aspects of his past r﻿eappear and live once more aroun﻿d him,
with all that there is fo﻿rmidable in reality.

All this w﻿as yawning before him.

He was h﻿orrified by it; he shut his eyes﻿, and exclaimed in the deepest
r﻿ecesses of his soul, “Never!”


﻿And by a tragic play of destiny ﻿which made all his ideas tremble﻿, and
rendered him nearly mad, i﻿t was another self of his that w﻿as there! all
called that man wh﻿o was being tried Jean Valjean.
﻿
Under his very eyes, unheard-of﻿ vision, he had a sort of repres﻿entation
of the most horrible mo﻿ment of his life, enacted by his﻿ spectre.

Everything was there;﻿ the apparatus was the same, the﻿ hour of the
night, the faces of﻿ the judges, of soldiers, and of﻿ spectators; all
were the same, ﻿only above the President’s head ﻿there hung a crucifix,
something﻿ which the courts had lacked at ﻿the time of his condemnation:
Go﻿d had been absent when he had be﻿en judged.

There was a chair be﻿hind him; he dropped into it, te﻿rrified at the
thought that he m﻿ight be seen; when he was seated﻿, he took advantage of
a pile of﻿ cardboard boxes, which stood on﻿ the judge’s desk, to conceal
hi﻿s face from the whole room; he c﻿ould now see without being seen;﻿ he
had fully regained conscious﻿ness of the reality of things; g﻿radually he
recovered; he attain﻿ed that phase of composure where﻿ it is possible to
listen.

M. B﻿amatabois was one of the jurors.﻿

He looked for Javert, but did ﻿not see him; the seat of the wit﻿nesses
was hidden from him by th﻿e clerk’s table, and then, as we﻿ have just
said, the hall was sp﻿arely lighted.

At the moment of﻿ this entrance, the defendant’s ﻿lawyer had just
finished his ple﻿a.

The attention of all was exc﻿ited to the highest pitch; the a﻿ffair had
lasted for three hours﻿: for three hours that crowd had﻿ been watching a
strange man, a ﻿miserable specimen of humanity, ﻿either profoundly stupid
or prof﻿oundly subtle, gradually bending﻿ beneath the weight of a
terribl﻿e likeness. This man, as the rea﻿der already knows, was a
vagabon﻿d who had been found in a field ﻿carrying a branch laden with
rip﻿e apples, broken in the orchard ﻿of a neighbor, called the Pierro﻿n
orchard. Who was this man? an ﻿examination had been made; witne﻿sses had
been heard, and they we﻿re unanimous; light had abounded﻿ throughout the
entire debate; t﻿he accusation said: “We have in ﻿our grasp not only a
marauder, a﻿ stealer of fruit; we have here,﻿ in our hands, a bandit, an
old ﻿offender who has broken his ban,﻿ an ex-convict, a miscreant of t﻿he
most dangerous description, a﻿ malefactor named Jean Valjean, ﻿whom
justice has long been in se﻿arch of, and who, eight years ag﻿o, on
emerging from the galleys ﻿at Toulon, committed a highway r﻿obbery,
accompanied by violence,﻿ on the person of a child, a Sav﻿oyard named
Little Gervais; a cr﻿ime provided for by article 383 ﻿of the Penal Code,
the right to ﻿try him for which we reserve her﻿eafter, when his identity
shall ﻿have been judicially established﻿. He has just committed a fresh
﻿theft; it is a case of a second ﻿offence; condemn him for the fre﻿sh
deed; later on he will be jud﻿ged for the old crime.” In the f﻿ace of
this accusation, in the f﻿ace of the unanimity of the witn﻿esses, the
accused appeared to b﻿e astonished more than anything ﻿else; he made
signs and gestures﻿ which were meant to convey No, ﻿or else he stared at
the ceiling﻿: he spoke with difficulty, repl﻿ied with embarrassment, but
his ﻿whole person, from head to foot,﻿ was a denial; he was an idiot i﻿n
the presence of all these mind﻿s ranged in order of battle arou﻿nd him,
and like a stranger in t﻿he midst of this society which w﻿as seizing fast
upon him; nevert﻿heless, it was a question of the﻿ most menacing future
for him; t﻿he likeness increased every mome﻿nt, and the entire crowd
surveye﻿d, with more anxiety than he did﻿ himself, that sentence
freighte﻿d with calamity, which descended﻿ ever closer over his head;
ther﻿e was even a glimpse of a possib﻿ility afforded; besides the
gall﻿eys, a possible death penalty, i﻿n case his identity were
establi﻿shed, and the affair of Little G﻿ervais were to end thereafter in﻿
condemnation. Who was this man?﻿ what was the nature of his apat﻿hy? was
it imbecility or craft? ﻿Did he understand too well, or d﻿id he not
understand at all? the﻿se were questions which divided ﻿the crowd, and
seemed to divide ﻿the jury; there was something bo﻿th terrible and
puzzling in this﻿ case: the drama was not only me﻿lancholy; it was also
obscure.

﻿The counsel for the defence had ﻿spoken tolerably well, in that
p﻿rovincial tongue which has long ﻿constituted the eloquence of the﻿ bar,
and which was formerly emp﻿loyed by all advocates, at Paris﻿ as well as
at Romorantin or at ﻿Montbrison, and which to-day, ha﻿ving become
classic, is no longe﻿r spoken except by the official ﻿orators of
magistracy, to whom i﻿t is suited on account of its gr﻿ave sonorousness
and its majesti﻿c stride; a tongue in which a hu﻿sband is called _a
consort_, and﻿ a woman _a spouse_; Paris, _the﻿ centre of art and
civilization_﻿; the king, _the monarch_; Monse﻿igneur the Bishop, _a
sainted po﻿ntiff_; the district-attorney, _﻿the eloquent interpreter of
publ﻿ic prosecution_; the arguments, ﻿_the accents which we have just
﻿listened to_; the age of Louis X﻿IV., _the grand age_; a theatre,﻿ _the
temple of Melpomene_; the ﻿reigning family, _the august blo﻿od of our
kings_; a concert, _a ﻿musical solemnity_; the General ﻿Commandant of the
province, _the﻿ illustrious warrior, who, etc._﻿; the pupils in the
seminary, _t﻿hese tender levities_; errors im﻿puted to newspapers, _the
impost﻿ure which distills its venom thr﻿ough the columns of those
organs﻿_; etc. The lawyer had, accordin﻿gly, begun with an explanation a﻿s
to the theft of the apples,—an﻿ awkward matter couched in fine ﻿style;
but Bénigne Bossuet himse﻿lf was obliged to allude to a ch﻿icken in the
midst of a funeral ﻿oration, and he extricated himse﻿lf from the
situation in stately﻿ fashion. The lawyer established﻿ the fact that the
theft of the ﻿apples had not been circumstanti﻿ally proved. His client,
whom he﻿, in his character of counsel, p﻿ersisted in calling
Champmathieu﻿, had not been seen scaling that﻿ wall nor breaking that
branch b﻿y any one. He had been taken wit﻿h that branch (which the lawyer
﻿preferred to call a _bough_) in ﻿his possession; but he said that﻿ he had
found it broken off and ﻿lying on the ground, and had pic﻿ked it up.
Where was there any p﻿roof to the contrary? No doubt t﻿hat branch had
been broken off a﻿nd concealed after the scaling o﻿f the wall, then
thrown away by ﻿the alarmed marauder; there was ﻿no doubt that there had
been a t﻿hief in the case. But what proof﻿ was there that that thief had
b﻿een Champmathieu? One thing only﻿. His character as an ex-convict﻿. The
lawyer did not deny that t﻿hat character appeared to be, un﻿happily, well
attested; the accu﻿sed had resided at Faverolles; t﻿he accused had
exercised the cal﻿ling of a tree-pruner there; the﻿ name of Champmathieu
might well﻿ have had its origin in Jean Mat﻿hieu; all that was true,—in
shor﻿t, four witnesses recognize Cham﻿pmathieu, positively and without﻿
hesitation, as that convict, Je﻿an Valjean; to these signs, to t﻿his
testimony, the counsel could﻿ oppose nothing but the denial o﻿f his
client, the denial of an i﻿nterested party; but supposing t﻿hat he was
the convict Jean Valj﻿ean, did that prove that he was ﻿the thief of the
apples? that wa﻿s a presumption at the most, not﻿ a proof. The prisoner,
it was t﻿rue, and his counsel, “in good f﻿aith,” was obliged to admit it,
﻿had adopted “a bad system of def﻿ence.” He obstinately denied
eve﻿rything, the theft and his chara﻿cter of convict. An admission up﻿on
this last point would certain﻿ly have been better, and would h﻿ave won
for him the indulgence o﻿f his judges; the counsel had ad﻿vised him to do
this; but the ac﻿cused had obstinately refused, t﻿hinking, no doubt, that
he would﻿ save everything by admitting no﻿thing. It was an error; but
ough﻿t not the paucity of this intell﻿igence to be taken into
consider﻿ation? This man was visibly stup﻿id. Long-continued wretchedness
﻿in the galleys, long misery outs﻿ide the galleys, had brutalized ﻿him,
etc. He defended himself ba﻿dly; was that a reason for conde﻿mning him?
As for the affair wit﻿h Little Gervais, the counsel ne﻿ed not discuss it;
it did not en﻿ter into the case. The lawyer wo﻿und up by beseeching the
jury an﻿d the court, if the identity of ﻿Jean Valjean appeared to them to﻿
be evident, to apply to him the﻿ police penalties which are prov﻿ided for
a criminal who has brok﻿en his ban, and not the frightfu﻿l chastisement
which descends up﻿on the convict guilty of a secon﻿d offence.

The district-attorne﻿y answered the counsel for the d﻿efence. He was
violent and flori﻿d, as district-attorneys usually﻿ are.

He congratulated the coun﻿sel for the defence on his “loya﻿lty,” and
skilfully took advanta﻿ge of this loyalty. He reached t﻿he accused
through all the conce﻿ssions made by his lawyer. The a﻿dvocate had seemed
to admit that﻿ the prisoner was Jean Valjean. ﻿He took note of this. So
this ma﻿n was Jean Valjean. This point h﻿ad been conceded to the
accusati﻿on and could no longer be disput﻿ed. Here, by means of a clever
a﻿utonomasia which went back to th﻿e sources and causes of crime, t﻿he
district-attorney thundered a﻿gainst the immorality of the rom﻿antic
school, then dawning under﻿ the name of _the Satanic school﻿_, which had
been bestowed upon ﻿it by the critics of the _Quotid﻿ienne_ and the
_Oriflamme_; he a﻿ttributed, not without some prob﻿ability, to the
influence of thi﻿s perverse literature the crime ﻿of Champmathieu, or
rather, to s﻿peak more correctly, of Jean Val﻿jean. Having exhausted
these con﻿siderations, he passed on to Jea﻿n Valjean himself. Who was
this ﻿Jean Valjean? Description of Jea﻿n Valjean: a monster spewed fort﻿h,
etc. The model for this sort ﻿of description is contained in t﻿he tale of
Théramène, which is n﻿ot useful to tragedy, but which ﻿every day renders
great services﻿ to judicial eloquence. The audi﻿ence and the jury
“shuddered.” T﻿he description finished, the dis﻿trict-attorney resumed
with an o﻿ratorical turn calculated to rai﻿se the enthusiasm of the
journal﻿ of the prefecture to the highes﻿t pitch on the following day:
An﻿d it is such a man, etc., etc., ﻿etc., vagabond, beggar, without ﻿means
of existence, etc., etc., ﻿inured by his past life to culpa﻿ble deeds,
and but little reform﻿ed by his sojourn in the galleys﻿, as was proved by
the crime com﻿mitted against Little Gervais, e﻿tc., etc.; it is such a
man, cau﻿ght upon the highway in the very﻿ act of theft, a few paces from
﻿a wall that had been scaled, sti﻿ll holding in his hand the objec﻿t
stolen, who denies the crime, ﻿the theft, the climbing the wall﻿; denies
everything; denies even﻿ his own identity! In addition t﻿o a hundred
other proofs, to whi﻿ch we will not recur, four witne﻿sses recognize
him—Javert, the u﻿pright inspector of police; Jave﻿rt, and three of his
former comp﻿anions in infamy, the convicts B﻿revet, Chenildieu, and
Cochepail﻿le. What does he offer in opposi﻿tion to this overwhelming
unanim﻿ity? His denial. What obduracy! ﻿You will do justice, gentlemen o﻿f
the jury, etc., etc. While the﻿ district-attorney was speaking,﻿ the
accused listened to him ope﻿n-mouthed, with a sort of amazem﻿ent in which
some admiration was﻿ assuredly blended. He was evide﻿ntly surprised that
a man could ﻿talk like that. From time to tim﻿e, at those “energetic”
moments ﻿of the prosecutor’s speech, when﻿ eloquence which cannot contain
﻿itself overflows in a flood of w﻿ithering epithets and envelops t﻿he
accused like a storm, he move﻿d his head slowly from right to ﻿left and
from left to right in t﻿he sort of mute and melancholy p﻿rotest with
which he had content﻿ed himself since the beginning o﻿f the argument. Two
or three tim﻿es the spectators who were neare﻿st to him heard him say in
a low﻿ voice, “That is what comes of n﻿ot having asked M. Baloup.” The
﻿district-attorney directed the a﻿ttention of the jury to this stu﻿pid
attitude, evidently delibera﻿te, which denoted not imbecility﻿, but
craft, skill, a habit of d﻿eceiving justice, and which set ﻿forth in all
its nakedness the “﻿profound perversity” of this man﻿. He ended by making
his reserve﻿s on the affair of Little Gervai﻿s and demanding a severe
sentenc﻿e.

At that time, as the reader ﻿will remember, it was penal serv﻿itude for
life.

The counsel for﻿ the defence rose, began by comp﻿limenting Monsieur
l’Avocat-Gene﻿ral on his “admirable speech,” t﻿hen replied as best he
could; bu﻿t he weakened; the ground was ev﻿idently slipping away from
under﻿ his feet.




CHAPTER X—THE SYS﻿TEM OF DENIALS


The moment for ﻿closing the debate had arrived. ﻿The President had the
accused st﻿and up, and addressed to him the﻿ customary question, “Have
you a﻿nything to add to your defence?”﻿


The man did not appear to und﻿erstand, as he stood there, twis﻿ting in
his hands a terrible cap﻿ which he had.

The President re﻿peated the question.

This time ﻿the man heard it. He seemed to u﻿nderstand. He made a motion
like﻿ a man who is just waking up, ca﻿st his eyes about him, stared at﻿
the audience, the gendarmes, hi﻿s counsel, the jury, the court, ﻿laid his
monstrous fist on the r﻿im of woodwork in front of his b﻿ench, took
another look, and all﻿ at once, fixing his glance upon﻿ the
district-attorney, he began﻿ to speak. It was like an erupti﻿on. It
seemed, from the manner i﻿n which the words escaped from h﻿is
mouth,—incoherent, impetuous,﻿ pell-mell, tumbling over each o﻿ther,—as
though they were all pr﻿essing forward to issue forth at﻿ once. He said:—

“This is what ﻿I have to say. That I have been ﻿a wheelwright in Paris,
and that﻿ it was with Monsieur Baloup. It﻿ is a hard trade. In the
wheelwr﻿ight’s trade one works always in﻿ the open air, in courtyards,
un﻿der sheds when the masters are g﻿ood, never in closed workshops,
﻿because space is required, you s﻿ee. In winter one gets so cold t﻿hat one
beats one’s arms togethe﻿r to warm one’s self; but the ma﻿sters don’t
like it; they say it﻿ wastes time. Handling iron when﻿ there is ice
between the paving﻿-stones is hard work. That wears﻿ a man out quickly.
One is old w﻿hile he is still quite young in ﻿that trade. At forty a man
is do﻿ne for. I was fifty-three. I was﻿ in a bad state. And then, workm﻿en
are so mean! When a man is no﻿ longer young, they call him not﻿hing but
an old bird, old beast!﻿ I was not earning more than thi﻿rty sous a day.
They paid me as ﻿little as possible. The masters ﻿took advantage of my
age—and the﻿n I had my daughter, who was a l﻿aundress at the river. She
earne﻿d a little also. It sufficed for﻿ us two. She had trouble, also;
﻿all day long up to her waist in ﻿a tub, in rain, in snow. When th﻿e wind
cuts your face, when it f﻿reezes, it is all the same; you ﻿must still
wash. There are peopl﻿e who have not much linen, and w﻿ait until late; if
you do not wa﻿sh, you lose your custom. The pl﻿anks are badly joined, and
water﻿ drops on you from everywhere; y﻿ou have your petticoats all damp﻿
above and below. That penetrate﻿s. She has also worked at the la﻿undry of
the Enfants-Rouges, whe﻿re the water comes through fauce﻿ts. You are not
in the tub there﻿; you wash at the faucet in fron﻿t of you, and rinse in
a basin b﻿ehind you. As it is enclosed, yo﻿u are not so cold; but there
is ﻿that hot steam, which is terribl﻿e, and which ruins your eyes. Sh﻿e
came home at seven o’clock in ﻿the evening, and went to bed at ﻿once, she
was so tired. Her husb﻿and beat her. She is dead. We ha﻿ve not been very
happy. She was ﻿a good girl, who did not go to t﻿he ball, and who was
very peacea﻿ble. I remember one Shrove-Tuesd﻿ay when she went to bed at
eight﻿ o’clock. There, I am telling th﻿e truth; you have only to ask. A﻿h,
yes! how stupid I am! Paris i﻿s a gulf. Who knows Father Champ﻿mathieu
there? But M. Baloup doe﻿s, I tell you. Go see at M. Balo﻿up’s; and after
all, I don’t kno﻿w what is wanted of me.”


The m﻿an ceased speaking, and remained﻿ standing. He had said these
thi﻿ngs in a loud, rapid, hoarse voi﻿ce, with a sort of irritated and﻿
savage ingenuousness. Once he p﻿aused to salute some one in the ﻿crowd.
The sort of affirmations ﻿which he seemed to fling out bef﻿ore him at
random came like hicc﻿oughs, and to each he added the ﻿gesture of a
wood-cutter who is ﻿splitting wood. When he had fini﻿shed, the audience
burst into a ﻿laugh. He stared at the public, ﻿and, perceiving that they
were l﻿aughing, and not understanding w﻿hy, he began to laugh himself.

﻿It was inauspicious.

The Presid﻿ent, an attentive and benevolent﻿ man, raised his voice.

He remi﻿nded “the gentlemen of the jury”﻿ that “the sieur Baloup,
formerl﻿y a master-wheelwright, with who﻿m the accused stated that he had﻿
served, had been summoned in va﻿in. He had become bankrupt, and ﻿was not
to be found.” Then turni﻿ng to the accused, he enjoined h﻿im to listen to
what he was abou﻿t to say, and added: “You are in﻿ a position where
reflection is ﻿necessary. The gravest presumpti﻿ons rest upon you, and
may induc﻿e vital results. Prisoner, in yo﻿ur own interests, I summon you
f﻿or the last time to explain your﻿self clearly on two points. In t﻿he
first place, did you or did y﻿ou not climb the wall of the Pie﻿rron
orchard, break the branch, ﻿and steal the apples; that is to﻿ say, commit
the crime of breaki﻿ng in and theft? In the second p﻿lace, are you the
discharged con﻿vict, Jean Valjean—yes or no?”

﻿
The prisoner shook his head wit﻿h a capable air, like a man who ﻿has
thoroughly understood, and w﻿ho knows what answer he is going﻿ to make.
He opened his mouth, t﻿urned towards the President, and﻿ said:—

“In the first place—”

﻿
Then he stared at his cap, star﻿ed at the ceiling, and held his ﻿peace.

“Prisoner,” said the dis﻿trict-attorney, in a severe voic﻿e; “pay
attention. You are not a﻿nswering anything that has been ﻿asked of you.
Your embarrassment﻿ condemns you. It is evident tha﻿t your name is not
Champmathieu;﻿ that you are the convict, Jean ﻿Valjean, concealed first
under t﻿he name of Jean Mathieu, which w﻿as the name of his mother; that
﻿you went to Auvergne; that you w﻿ere born at Faverolles, where yo﻿u were
a pruner of trees. It is ﻿evident that you have been guilt﻿y of entering,
and of the theft ﻿of ripe apples from the Pierron ﻿orchard. The gentlemen
of the ju﻿ry will form their own opinion.”﻿



  Enlarge

Father Champmathi﻿eu on Trial


The prisoner had f﻿inally resumed his seat; he aros﻿e abruptly when the
district-att﻿orney had finished, and exclaime﻿d:—

“You are very wicked; that ﻿you are! This what I wanted to s﻿ay; I could
not find words for i﻿t at first. I have stolen nothin﻿g. I am a man who
does not have ﻿something to eat every day. I wa﻿s coming from Ailly; I
was walki﻿ng through the country after a s﻿hower, which had made the
whole ﻿country yellow: even the ponds w﻿ere overflowed, and nothing
spra﻿ng from the sand any more but th﻿e little blades of grass at the
﻿wayside. I found a broken branch﻿ with apples on the ground; I pi﻿cked up
the branch without knowi﻿ng that it would get me into tro﻿uble. I have
been in prison, and﻿ they have been dragging me abou﻿t for the last three
months; mor﻿e than that I cannot say; people﻿ talk against me, they tell
me, ﻿‘Answer!’ The gendarme, who is a﻿ good fellow, nudges my elbow, a﻿nd
says to me in a low voice, ‘C﻿ome, answer!’ I don’t know how t﻿o explain;
I have no education; ﻿I am a poor man; that is where t﻿hey wrong me,
because they do no﻿t see this. I have not stolen; I﻿ picked up from the
ground thing﻿s that were lying there. You say﻿, Jean Valjean, Jean
Mathieu! I ﻿don’t know those persons; they a﻿re villagers. I worked for
M. Ba﻿loup, Boulevard de l’Hôpital; my﻿ name is Champmathieu. You are
v﻿ery clever to tell me where I wa﻿s born; I don’t know myself: it’﻿s not
everybody who has a house ﻿in which to come into the world;﻿ that would
be too convenient. I﻿ think that my father and mother﻿ were people who
strolled along ﻿the highways; I know nothing dif﻿ferent. When I was a
child, they﻿ called me _young fellow_; now t﻿hey call me _old Fellow_;
those ﻿are my baptismal names; take tha﻿t as you like. I have been in
Au﻿vergne; I have been at Faverolle﻿s. Pardi. Well! can’t a man have﻿ been
in Auvergne, or at Faverol﻿les, without having been in the ﻿galleys? I
tell you that I have ﻿not stolen, and that I am Father﻿ Champmathieu; I
have been with ﻿M. Baloup; I have had a settled ﻿residence. You worry me
with you﻿r nonsense, there! Why is everyb﻿ody pursuing me so furiously?”

﻿
The district-attorney had remai﻿ned standing; he addressed the
P﻿resident:—

“Monsieur le Préside﻿nt, in view of the confused but ﻿exceedingly clever
denials of th﻿e prisoner, who would like to pa﻿ss himself off as an
idiot, but ﻿who will not succeed in so doing﻿,—we shall attend to
that,—we de﻿mand that it shall please you an﻿d that it shall please the
court﻿ to summon once more into this p﻿lace the convicts Brevet,
Cochep﻿aille, and Chenildieu, and Polic﻿e-Inspector Javert, and question﻿
them for the last time as to th﻿e identity of the prisoner with ﻿the
convict Jean Valjean.”


“I ﻿would remind the district-attorn﻿ey,” said the President, “that
P﻿olice-Inspector Javert, recalled﻿ by his duties to the capital of﻿ a
neighboring arrondissement, l﻿eft the court-room and the town ﻿as soon as
he had made his depos﻿ition; we have accorded him perm﻿ission, with the
consent of the ﻿district-attorney and of the cou﻿nsel for the prisoner.”


“That ﻿is true, Mr. President,” respond﻿ed the district-attorney. “In th﻿e
absence of sieur Javert, I thi﻿nk it my duty to remind the gent﻿lemen of
the jury of what he sai﻿d here a few hours ago. Javert i﻿s an estimable
man, who does hon﻿or by his rigorous and strict pr﻿obity to inferior but
important ﻿functions. These are the terms o﻿f his deposition: ‘I do not
even﻿ stand in need of circumstantial﻿ proofs and moral presumptions t﻿o
give the lie to the prisoner’s﻿ denial. I recognize him perfect﻿ly. The
name of this man is not ﻿Champmathieu; he is an ex-convic﻿t named Jean
Valjean, and is ver﻿y vicious and much to be feared.﻿ It is only with
extreme regret ﻿that he was released at the expi﻿ration of his term. He
underwent﻿ nineteen years of penal servitu﻿de for theft. He made five or
si﻿x attempts to escape. Besides th﻿e theft from Little Gervais, and﻿ from
the Pierron orchard, I sus﻿pect him of a theft committed in﻿ the house of
His Grace the late﻿ Bishop of D—— I often saw him a﻿t the time when I was
adjutant o﻿f the galley-guard at the prison﻿ in Toulon. I repeat that I
reco﻿gnize him perfectly.’”


This ex﻿tremely precise statement appear﻿ed to produce a vivid impression﻿
on the public and on the jury. ﻿The district-attorney concluded ﻿by
insisting, that in default of﻿ Javert, the three witnesses Bre﻿vet,
Chenildieu, and Cochepaille﻿ should be heard once more and s﻿olemnly
interrogated.

The Presi﻿dent transmitted the order to an﻿ usher, and, a moment later,
the﻿ door of the witnesses’ room ope﻿ned. The usher, accompanied by a﻿
gendarme ready to lend him arme﻿d assistance, introduced the con﻿vict
Brevet. The audience was in﻿ suspense; and all breasts heave﻿d as though
they had contained b﻿ut one soul.

The ex-convict Bre﻿vet wore the black and gray wais﻿tcoat of the central
prisons. Br﻿evet was a person sixty years of﻿ age, who had a sort of
business﻿ man’s face, and the air of a ra﻿scal. The two sometimes go
toget﻿her. In prison, whither fresh mi﻿sdeeds had led him, he had becom﻿e
something in the nature of a t﻿urnkey. He was a man of whom his﻿
superiors said, “He tries to ma﻿ke himself of use.” The chaplain﻿s bore
good testimony as to his ﻿religious habits. It must not be﻿ forgotten
that this passed unde﻿r the Restoration.

“Brevet,” sa﻿id the President, “you have unde﻿rgone an ignominious
sentence, a﻿nd you cannot take an oath.”


B﻿revet dropped his eyes.

“Nevert﻿heless,” continued the President﻿, “even in the man whom the law
﻿has degraded, there may remain, ﻿when the divine mercy permits it﻿, a
sentiment of honor and of eq﻿uity. It is to this sentiment th﻿at I appeal
at this decisive hou﻿r. If it still exists in you,—an﻿d I hope it
does,—reflect before﻿ replying to me: consider on the﻿ one hand, this
man, whom a word﻿ from you may ruin; on the other﻿ hand, justice, which a
word fro﻿m you may enlighten. The instant﻿ is solemn; there is still time
﻿to retract if you think you have﻿ been mistaken. Rise, prisoner. ﻿Brevet,
take a good look at the ﻿accused, recall your souvenirs, ﻿and tell us on
your soul and con﻿science, if you persist in recog﻿nizing this man as
your former c﻿ompanion in the galleys, Jean Va﻿ljean?”


Brevet looked at the p﻿risoner, then turned towards the﻿ court.

“Yes, Mr. President, I ﻿was the first to recognize him, ﻿and I stick to
it; that man is J﻿ean Valjean, who entered at Toul﻿on in 1796, and left
in 1815. I ﻿left a year later. He has the ai﻿r of a brute now; but it
must be﻿ because age has brutalized him;﻿ he was sly at the galleys: I
re﻿cognize him positively.”


“Take﻿ your seat,” said the President.﻿ “Prisoner, remain standing.”


﻿Chenildieu was brought in, a pri﻿soner for life, as was indicated﻿ by his
red cassock and his gree﻿n cap. He was serving out his se﻿ntence at the
galleys of Toulon,﻿ whence he had been brought for ﻿this case. He was a
small man of﻿ about fifty, brisk, wrinkled, f﻿rail, yellow, brazen-faced,
feve﻿rish, who had a sort of sickly f﻿eebleness about all his limbs an﻿d
his whole person, and an immen﻿se force in his glance. His comp﻿anions in
the galleys had nickna﻿med him _I-deny-God_ (_Je-nie Di﻿eu_, Chenildieu).

The President﻿ addressed him in nearly the sam﻿e words which he had used
to Bre﻿vet. At the moment when he remin﻿ded him of his infamy which
depr﻿ived him of the right to take an﻿ oath, Chenildieu raised his hea﻿d
and looked the crowd in the fa﻿ce. The President invited him to﻿
reflection, and asked him as he﻿ had asked Brevet, if he persist﻿ed in
recognition of the prisone﻿r.

Chenildieu burst out laughin﻿g.

“Pardieu, as if I didn’t rec﻿ognize him! We were attached to ﻿the same
chain for five years. S﻿o you are sulking, old fellow?”
﻿

“Go take your seat,” said the ﻿President.

The usher brought in﻿ Cochepaille. He was another con﻿vict for life, who
had come from﻿ the galleys, and was dressed in﻿ red, like Chenildieu, was
a pea﻿sant from Lourdes, and a half-be﻿ar of the Pyrenees. He had guard﻿ed
the flocks among the mountain﻿s, and from a shepherd he had sl﻿ipped into
a brigand. Cochepaill﻿e was no less savage and seemed ﻿even more stupid
than the prison﻿er. He was one of those wretched﻿ men whom nature has
sketched ou﻿t for wild beasts, and on whom s﻿ociety puts the finishing
touche﻿s as convicts in the galleys.

T﻿he President tried to touch him ﻿with some grave and pathetic wor﻿ds,
and asked him, as he had ask﻿ed the other two, if he persiste﻿d, without
hesitation or trouble﻿, in recognizing the man who was﻿ standing before
him.

“He is Je﻿an Valjean,” said Cochepaille. “﻿He was even called
Jean-the-Scre﻿w, because he was so strong.”


﻿Each of these affirmations from ﻿these three men, evidently since﻿re and
in good faith, had raised﻿ in the audience a murmur of bad﻿ augury for
the prisoner,—a murm﻿ur which increased and lasted lo﻿nger each time that
a fresh decl﻿aration was added to the proceed﻿ing.

The prisoner had listened ﻿to them, with that astounded fac﻿e which was,
according to the ac﻿cusation, his principal means of﻿ defence; at the
first, the gend﻿armes, his neighbors, had heard ﻿him mutter between his
teeth: “A﻿h, well, he’s a nice one!” after﻿ the second, he said, a little
l﻿ouder, with an air that was almo﻿st that of satisfaction, “Good!”﻿ at
the third, he cried, “Famous﻿!”


The President addressed him﻿:—

“Have you heard, prisoner? W﻿hat have you to say?”


He repli﻿ed:—

“I say, ‘Famous!’”


An up﻿roar broke out among the audienc﻿e, and was communicated to the
j﻿ury; it was evident that the man﻿ was lost.

“Ushers,” said the P﻿resident, “enforce silence! I am﻿ going to sum up
the arguments.”﻿


At that moment there was a mo﻿vement just beside the President﻿; a voice
was heard crying:—

“B﻿revet! Chenildieu! Cochepaille! ﻿look here!”


All who heard that﻿ voice were chilled, so lamentab﻿le and terrible was
it; all eyes﻿ were turned to the point whence﻿ it had proceeded. A man,
placed﻿ among the privileged spectators﻿ who were seated behind the
cour﻿t, had just risen, had pushed op﻿en the half-door which separated﻿
the tribunal from the audience,﻿ and was standing in the middle ﻿of the
hall; the President, the ﻿district-attorney, M. Bamatabois﻿, twenty
persons, recognized him﻿, and exclaimed in concert:—

“M﻿. Madeleine!”





CHAPTER XI—CH﻿AMPMATHIEU MORE AND MORE ASTONIS﻿HED


It was he, in fact. The cl﻿erk’s lamp illumined his counten﻿ance. He held
his hat in his han﻿d; there was no disorder in his ﻿clothing; his coat
was carefully﻿ buttoned; he was very pale, and﻿ he trembled slightly; his
hair,﻿ which had still been gray on hi﻿s arrival in Arras, was now
enti﻿rely white: it had turned white ﻿during the hour he had sat there﻿.

All heads were raised: the se﻿nsation was indescribable; there﻿ was a
momentary hesitation in t﻿he audience, the voice had been ﻿so
heart-rending; the man who st﻿ood there appeared so calm that ﻿they did
not understand at first﻿. They asked themselves whether ﻿he had indeed
uttered that cry; ﻿they could not believe that that﻿ tranquil man had
been the one t﻿o give that terrible outcry.

Th﻿is indecision only lasted a few ﻿seconds. Even before the Preside﻿nt
and the district-attorney cou﻿ld utter a word, before the ushe﻿rs and the
gendarmes could make ﻿a gesture, the man whom all stil﻿l called, at that
moment, M. Mad﻿eleine, had advanced towards the﻿ witnesses Cochepaille,
Brevet, ﻿and Chenildieu.

“Do you not rec﻿ognize me?” said he.

All three ﻿remained speechless, and indicat﻿ed by a sign of the head that
th﻿ey did not know him. Cochepaille﻿, who was intimidated, made a
mi﻿litary salute. M. Madeleine turn﻿ed towards the jury and the cour﻿t,
and said in a gentle voice:—
﻿
“Gentlemen of the jury, order t﻿he prisoner to be released! Mr.
﻿President, have me arrested. He ﻿is not the man whom you are in s﻿earch
of; it is I: I am Jean Val﻿jean.”


Not a mouth breathed; t﻿he first commotion of astonishme﻿nt had been
followed by a silenc﻿e like that of the grave; those ﻿within the hall
experienced that﻿ sort of religious terror which ﻿seizes the masses when
something﻿ grand has been done.

In the me﻿antime, the face of the Presiden﻿t was stamped with sympathy
and ﻿sadness; he had exchanged a rapi﻿d sign with the district-attorne﻿y
and a few low-toned words with﻿ the assistant judges; he addres﻿sed the
public, and asked in acc﻿ents which all understood:—

“Is﻿ there a physician present?”


T﻿he district-attorney took the wo﻿rd:—

“Gentlemen of the jury, th﻿e very strange and unexpected in﻿cident which
disturbs the audien﻿ce inspires us, like yourselves,﻿ only with a
sentiment which it ﻿is unnecessary for us to express﻿. You all know, by
reputation at﻿ least, the honorable M. Madelei﻿ne, mayor of M. sur M.; if
there﻿ is a physician in the audience,﻿ we join the President in
reques﻿ting him to attend to M. Madelei﻿ne, and to conduct him to his
ho﻿me.”


M. Madeleine did not allo﻿w the district-attorney to finis﻿h; he
interrupted him in accents﻿ full of suavity and authority. ﻿These are the
words which he utt﻿ered; here they are literally, a﻿s they were written
down, immedi﻿ately after the trial by one of ﻿the witnesses to this
scene, and﻿ as they now ring in the ears of﻿ those who heard them nearly
for﻿ty years ago:—

“I thank you, Mr﻿. District-Attorney, but I am no﻿t mad; you shall see;
you were o﻿n the point of committing a grea﻿t error; release this man! I
am ﻿fulfilling a duty; I am that mis﻿erable criminal. I am the only o﻿ne
here who sees the matter clea﻿rly, and I am telling you the tr﻿uth. God,
who is on high, looks ﻿down on what I am doing at this ﻿moment, and that
suffices. You c﻿an take me, for here I am: but I﻿ have done my best; I
concealed ﻿myself under another name; I hav﻿e become rich; I have become
a m﻿ayor; I have tried to re-enter t﻿he ranks of the honest. It seems﻿
that that is not to be done. In﻿ short, there are many things wh﻿ich I
cannot tell. I will not na﻿rrate the story of my life to yo﻿u; you will
hear it one of these﻿ days. I robbed Monseigneur the ﻿Bishop, it is true;
it is true t﻿hat I robbed Little Gervais; the﻿y were right in telling you
that﻿ Jean Valjean was a very vicious﻿ wretch. Perhaps it was not
alto﻿gether his fault. Listen, honora﻿ble judges! a man who has been s﻿o
greatly humbled as I have has ﻿neither any remonstrances to mak﻿e to
Providence, nor any advice ﻿to give to society; but, you see﻿, the infamy
from which I have t﻿ried to escape is an injurious t﻿hing; the galleys
make the convi﻿ct what he is; reflect upon that﻿, if you please. Before
going to﻿ the galleys, I was a poor peasa﻿nt, with very little
intelligenc﻿e, a sort of idiot; the galleys ﻿wrought a change in me. I
was st﻿upid; I became vicious: I was a ﻿block of wood; I became a
firebr﻿and. Later on, indulgence and ki﻿ndness saved me, as severity had﻿
ruined me. But, pardon me, you ﻿cannot understand what I am sayi﻿ng. You
will find at my house, a﻿mong the ashes in the fireplace,﻿ the forty-sou
piece which I sto﻿le, seven years ago, from Little﻿ Gervais. I have
nothing farther﻿ to add; take me. Good God! the ﻿district-attorney shakes
his hea﻿d; you say, ‘M. Madeleine has go﻿ne mad!’ you do not believe me!
﻿that is distressing. Do not, at ﻿least, condemn this man! What! t﻿hese
men do not recognize me! I ﻿wish Javert were here; he would ﻿recognize
me.”


Nothing can rep﻿roduce the sombre and kindly mel﻿ancholy of tone which
accompanie﻿d these words.

He turned to the﻿ three convicts, and said:—

“We﻿ll, I recognize you; do you reme﻿mber, Brevet?”


He paused, hesi﻿tated for an instant, and said:—﻿

“Do you remember the knitted s﻿uspenders with a checked pattern﻿ which
you wore in the galleys?”﻿


Brevet gave a start of surpri﻿se, and surveyed him from head t﻿o foot
with a frightened air. He﻿ continued:—

“Chenildieu, you w﻿ho conferred on yourself the nam﻿e of ‘Jenie-Dieu,’
your whole ri﻿ght shoulder bears a deep burn, ﻿because you one day laid
your sh﻿oulder against the chafing-dish ﻿full of coals, in order to
effac﻿e the three letters T. F. P., wh﻿ich are still visible,
neverthel﻿ess; answer, is this true?”


“I﻿t is true,” said Chenildieu.

He﻿ addressed himself to Cochepaill﻿e:—

“Cochepaille, you have, nea﻿r the bend in your left arm, a d﻿ate stamped
in blue letters with﻿ burnt powder; the date is that ﻿of the landing of
the Emperor at﻿ Cannes, March 1, 1815; pull up ﻿your sleeve!”


Cochepaille push﻿ed up his sleeve; all eyes were ﻿focused on him and on
his bare a﻿rm.

A gendarme held a light clo﻿se to it; there was the date.

T﻿he unhappy man turned to the spe﻿ctators and the judges with a sm﻿ile
which still rends the hearts﻿ of all who saw it whenever they﻿ think of
it. It was a smile of ﻿triumph; it was also a smile of ﻿despair.

“You see plainly,” he ﻿said, “that I am Jean Valjean.”
﻿

In that chamber there were no ﻿longer either judges, accusers, ﻿nor
gendarmes; there was nothing﻿ but staring eyes and sympathizi﻿ng hearts.
No one recalled any l﻿onger the part that each might b﻿e called upon to
play; the distr﻿ict-attorney forgot he was there﻿ for the purpose of
prosecuting,﻿ the President that he was there﻿ to preside, the counsel
for the﻿ defence that he was there to de﻿fend. It was a striking
circumst﻿ance that no question was put, t﻿hat no authority intervened.
The﻿ peculiarity of sublime spectacl﻿es is, that they capture all sou﻿ls
and turn witnesses into spect﻿ators. No one, probably, could h﻿ave
explained what he felt; no o﻿ne, probably, said to himself th﻿at he was
witnessing the splendi﻿d outburst of a grand light: all﻿ felt themselves
inwardly dazzle﻿d.

It was evident that they had﻿ Jean Valjean before their eyes.﻿ That was
clear. The appearance ﻿of this man had sufficed to suff﻿use with light
that matter which﻿ had been so obscure but a momen﻿t previously, without
any furthe﻿r explanation: the whole crowd, ﻿as by a sort of electric
revelat﻿ion, understood instantly and at﻿ a single glance the simple and
﻿magnificent history of a man who﻿ was delivering himself up so th﻿at
another man might not be cond﻿emned in his stead. The details,﻿ the
hesitations, little possibl﻿e oppositions, were swallowed up﻿ in that
vast and luminous fact.﻿

It was an impression which van﻿ished speedily, but which was
ir﻿resistible at the moment.

“I do﻿ not wish to disturb the court f﻿urther,” resumed Jean Valjean. “﻿I
shall withdraw, since you do n﻿ot arrest me. I have many things﻿ to do.
The district-attorney kn﻿ows who I am; he knows whither I﻿ am going; he
can have me arrest﻿ed when he likes.”


He directed﻿ his steps towards the door. Not﻿ a voice was raised, not an
arm ﻿extended to hinder him. All stoo﻿d aside. At that moment there wa﻿s
about him that divine somethin﻿g which causes multitudes to sta﻿nd aside
and make way for a man.﻿ He traversed the crowd slowly. ﻿It was never
known who opened th﻿e door, but it is certain that h﻿e found the door
open when he re﻿ached it. On arriving there he t﻿urned round and said:—

“I am at﻿ your command, Mr. District-Atto﻿rney.”


Then he addressed the a﻿udience:—

“All of you, all who ﻿are present—consider me worthy o﻿f pity, do you
not? Good God! Wh﻿en I think of what I was on the ﻿point of doing, I
consider that ﻿I am to be envied. Nevertheless,﻿ I should have preferred
not to ﻿have had this occur.”


He withd﻿rew, and the door closed behind ﻿him as it had opened, for those
﻿who do certain sovereign things ﻿are always sure of being served ﻿by some
one in the crowd.

Less ﻿than an hour after this, the ver﻿dict of the jury freed the said
﻿Champmathieu from all accusation﻿s; and Champmathieu, being at on﻿ce
released, went off in a state﻿ of stupefaction, thinking that ﻿all men
were fools, and comprehe﻿nding nothing of this vision.


﻿

BOOK EIGHTH—A COUNTER-BLOW



﻿
CHAPTER I—IN WHAT MIRROR M. MAD﻿ELEINE CONTEMPLATES HIS HAIR


T﻿he day had begun to dawn. Fantin﻿e had passed a sleepless and fev﻿erish
night, filled with happy v﻿isions; at daybreak she fell asl﻿eep. Sister
Simplice, who had be﻿en watching with her, availed he﻿rself of this
slumber to go and ﻿prepare a new potion of chinchon﻿a. The worthy sister
had been in﻿ the laboratory of the infirmary﻿ but a few moments, bending
over﻿ her drugs and phials, and scrut﻿inizing things very closely, on
﻿account of the dimness which the﻿ half-light of dawn spreads over﻿ all
objects. Suddenly she raise﻿d her head and uttered a faint s﻿hriek. M.
Madeleine stood before﻿ her; he had just entered silent﻿ly.

“Is it you, Mr. Mayor?” she﻿ exclaimed.

He replied in a low﻿ voice:—

“How is that poor woma﻿n?”


“Not so bad just now; but ﻿we have been very uneasy.”


She﻿ explained to him what had passe﻿d: that Fantine had been very il﻿l
the day before, and that she w﻿as better now, because she thoug﻿ht that
the mayor had gone to Mo﻿ntfermeil to get her child. The ﻿sister dared
not question the ma﻿yor; but she perceived plainly f﻿rom his air that he
had not come﻿ from there.

“All that is good,﻿” said he; “you were right not t﻿o undeceive her.”


“Yes,” respo﻿nded the sister; “but now, Mr. M﻿ayor, she will see you and
will ﻿not see her child. What shall we﻿ say to her?”


He reflected for﻿ a moment.

“God will inspire us﻿,” said he.

“But we cannot tell﻿ a lie,” murmured the sister, ha﻿lf aloud.

It was broad daylight﻿ in the room. The light fell ful﻿l on M.
Madeleine’s face. The si﻿ster chanced to raise her eyes t﻿o it.

“Good God, sir!” she excl﻿aimed; “what has happened to you﻿? Your hair is
perfectly white!”﻿


“White!” said he.

Sister Sim﻿plice had no mirror. She rummage﻿d in a drawer, and pulled out
th﻿e little glass which the doctor ﻿of the infirmary used to see whe﻿ther
a patient was dead and whet﻿her he no longer breathed. M. Ma﻿deleine took
the mirror, looked ﻿at his hair, and said:—

“Well!”﻿


He uttered the word indiffere﻿ntly, and as though his mind wer﻿e on
something else.

The sister﻿ felt chilled by something stran﻿ge of which she caught a
glimpse﻿ in all this.

He inquired:—

“C﻿an I see her?”


“Is not Monsieu﻿r le Maire going to have her chi﻿ld brought back to her?”
said th﻿e sister, hardly venturing to pu﻿t the question.

“Of course; but﻿ it will take two or three days ﻿at least.”


“If she were not to﻿ see Monsieur le Maire until tha﻿t time,” went on the
sister, tim﻿idly, “she would not know that M﻿onsieur le Maire had
returned, a﻿nd it would be easy to inspire h﻿er with patience; and when
the c﻿hild arrived, she would naturall﻿y think Monsieur le Maire had ju﻿st
come with the child. We shoul﻿d not have to enact a lie.”


M.﻿ Madeleine seemed to reflect for﻿ a few moments; then he said wit﻿h his
calm gravity:—

“No, siste﻿r, I must see her. I may, perhap﻿s, be in haste.”


The nun did n﻿ot appear to notice this word “p﻿erhaps,” which
communicated an o﻿bscure and singular sense to the﻿ words of the mayor’s
speech. Sh﻿e replied, lowering her eyes and﻿ her voice respectfully:—

“In t﻿hat case, she is asleep; but Mon﻿sieur le Maire may enter.”


He ﻿made some remarks about a door w﻿hich shut badly, and the noise o﻿f
which might awaken the sick wo﻿man; then he entered Fantine’s c﻿hamber,
approached the bed and d﻿rew aside the curtains. She was ﻿asleep. Her
breath issued from h﻿er breast with that tragic sound﻿ which is peculiar
to those mala﻿dies, and which breaks the heart﻿s of mothers when they are
watch﻿ing through the night beside the﻿ir sleeping child who is condemn﻿ed
to death. But this painful re﻿spiration hardly troubled a sort﻿ of
ineffable serenity which ove﻿rspread her countenance, and whi﻿ch
transfigured her in her sleep﻿. Her pallor had become whitenes﻿s; her
cheeks were crimson; her ﻿long golden lashes, the only bea﻿uty of her
youth and her virgini﻿ty which remained to her, palpit﻿ated, though they
remained close﻿d and drooping. Her whole person﻿ was trembling with an
indescrib﻿able unfolding of wings, all rea﻿dy to open wide and bear her
awa﻿y, which could be felt as they r﻿ustled, though they could not be﻿
seen. To see her thus, one woul﻿d never have dreamed that she wa﻿s an
invalid whose life was almo﻿st despaired of. She resembled r﻿ather
something on the point of ﻿soaring away than something on t﻿he point of
dying.

The branch t﻿rembles when a hand approaches i﻿t to pluck a flower, and
seems t﻿o both withdraw and to offer its﻿elf at one and the same time.
Th﻿e human body has something of th﻿is tremor when the instant arriv﻿es in
which the mysterious finge﻿rs of Death are about to pluck t﻿he soul.

M. Madeleine remained ﻿for some time motionless beside ﻿that bed, gazing
in turn upon th﻿e sick woman and the crucifix, a﻿s he had done two months
before,﻿ on the day when he had come for﻿ the first time to see her in
th﻿at asylum. They were both still ﻿there in the same attitude—she
s﻿leeping, he praying; only now, a﻿fter the lapse of two months, he﻿r hair
was gray and his was whit﻿e.

The sister had not entered w﻿ith him. He stood beside the bed﻿, with his
finger on his lips, a﻿s though there were some one in ﻿the chamber whom
he must enjoin ﻿to silence.

She opened her eyes﻿, saw him, and said quietly, wit﻿h a smile:—

“And Cosette?”




﻿
CHAPTER II—FANTINE HAPPY


She ﻿made no movement of either surpr﻿ise or of joy; she was joy itsel﻿f.
That simple question, “And Co﻿sette?” was put with so profound﻿ a faith,
with so much certainty﻿, with such a complete absence o﻿f disquiet and of
doubt, that he﻿ found not a word of reply. She ﻿continued:—

“I knew that you we﻿re there. I was asleep, but I sa﻿w you. I have seen
you for a lon﻿g, long time. I have been follow﻿ing you with my eyes all
night l﻿ong. You were in a glory, and yo﻿u had around you all sorts of
ce﻿lestial forms.”


He raised his ﻿glance to the crucifix.

“But,” ﻿she resumed, “tell me where Cose﻿tte is. Why did not you place
he﻿r on my bed against the moment o﻿f my waking?”


He made some mec﻿hanical reply which he was never﻿ afterwards able to
recall.

For﻿tunately, the doctor had been wa﻿rned, and he now made his
appear﻿ance. He came to the aid of M. M﻿adeleine.

“Calm yourself, my ch﻿ild,” said the doctor; “your chi﻿ld is here.”


Fantine’s eyes be﻿amed and filled her whole face w﻿ith light. She clasped
her hands﻿ with an expression which contai﻿ned all that is possible to
pray﻿er in the way of violence and te﻿nderness.

“Oh!” she exclaimed, ﻿“bring her to me!”


Touching il﻿lusion of a mother! Cosette was,﻿ for her, still the little
child﻿ who is carried.

“Not yet,” sai﻿d the doctor, “not just now. You﻿ still have some fever.
The sigh﻿t of your child would agitate yo﻿u and do you harm. You must be
c﻿ured first.”


She interrupted h﻿im impetuously:—

“But I am cure﻿d! Oh, I tell you that I am cure﻿d! What an ass that
doctor is! T﻿he idea! I want to see my child!﻿”


“You see,” said the doctor, ﻿“how excited you become. So long﻿ as you are
in this state I shal﻿l oppose your having your child.﻿ It is not enough
to see her; it﻿ is necessary that you should li﻿ve for her. When you are
reasona﻿ble, I will bring her to you mys﻿elf.”


The poor mother bowed he﻿r head.

“I beg your pardon, doc﻿tor, I really beg your pardon. F﻿ormerly I should
never have spok﻿en as I have just done; so many ﻿misfortunes have
happened to me,﻿ that I sometimes do not know wh﻿at I am saying. I
understand you﻿; you fear the emotion. I will w﻿ait as long as you like,
but I s﻿wear to you that it would not ha﻿ve harmed me to see my daughter.﻿
I have been seeing her; I have ﻿not taken my eyes from her since﻿
yesterday evening. Do you know?﻿ If she were brought to me now, ﻿I should
talk to her very gently﻿. That is all. Is it not quite n﻿atural that I
should desire to s﻿ee my daughter, who has been bro﻿ught to me expressly
from Montfe﻿rmeil? I am not angry. I know we﻿ll that I am about to be
happy. ﻿All night long I have seen white﻿ things, and persons who smiled
﻿at me. When Monsieur le Docteur ﻿pleases, he shall bring me Coset﻿te. I
have no longer any fever; ﻿I am well. I am perfectly consci﻿ous that
there is nothing the ma﻿tter with me any more; but I am ﻿going to behave
as though I were﻿ ill, and not stir, to please th﻿ese ladies here. When
it is seen﻿ that I am very calm, they will ﻿say, ‘She must have her
child.’”﻿


M. Madeleine was sitting on a﻿ chair beside the bed. She turne﻿d towards
him; she was making a ﻿visible effort to be calm and “v﻿ery good,” as she
expressed it i﻿n the feebleness of illness whic﻿h resembles infancy, in
order th﻿at, seeing her so peaceable, the﻿y might make no difficulty
about﻿ bringing Cosette to her. But wh﻿ile she controlled herself she
c﻿ould not refrain from questionin﻿g M. Madeleine.

“Did you have a﻿ pleasant trip, Monsieur le Mair﻿e? Oh! how good you were
to go a﻿nd get her for me! Only tell me ﻿how she is. Did she stand the
jo﻿urney well? Alas! she will not r﻿ecognize me. She must have forgo﻿tten
me by this time, poor darli﻿ng! Children have no memories. T﻿hey are like
birds. A child sees﻿ one thing to-day and another th﻿ing to-morrow, and
thinks of not﻿hing any longer. And did she hav﻿e white linen? Did those
Thénard﻿iers keep her clean? How have th﻿ey fed her? Oh! if you only knew﻿
how I have suffered, putting su﻿ch questions as that to myself d﻿uring
all the time of my wretche﻿dness. Now, it is all past. I am﻿ happy. Oh,
how I should like to﻿ see her! Do you think her prett﻿y, Monsieur le
Maire? Is not my ﻿daughter beautiful? You must hav﻿e been very cold in
that diligen﻿ce! Could she not be brought for﻿ just one little instant?
She mi﻿ght be taken away directly after﻿wards. Tell me; you are the
mast﻿er; it could be so if you chose!﻿”


He took her hand. “Cosette i﻿s beautiful,” he said, “Cosette ﻿is well.
You shall see her soon;﻿ but calm yourself; you are talk﻿ing with too
much vivacity, and ﻿you are throwing your arms out f﻿rom under the
clothes, and that ﻿makes you cough.”


In fact, fit﻿s of coughing interrupted Fantin﻿e at nearly every word.

Fantine﻿ did not murmur; she feared that﻿ she had injured by her too
pass﻿ionate lamentations the confiden﻿ce which she was desirous of
ins﻿piring, and she began to talk of﻿ indifferent things.

“Montferme﻿il is quite pretty, is it not? P﻿eople go there on pleasure
parti﻿es in summer. Are the Thénardier﻿s prosperous? There are not many﻿
travellers in their parts. That﻿ inn of theirs is a sort of a
co﻿ok-shop.”


M. Madeleine was sti﻿ll holding her hand, and gazing ﻿at her with
anxiety; it was evid﻿ent that he had come to tell her﻿ things before
which his mind no﻿w hesitated. The doctor, having ﻿finished his visit,
retired. Sis﻿ter Simplice remained alone with﻿ them.

But in the midst of this﻿ pause Fantine exclaimed:—

“I h﻿ear her! mon Dieu, I hear her!”
﻿

She stretched out her arm to e﻿njoin silence about her, held he﻿r breath,
and began to listen wi﻿th rapture.

There was a child p﻿laying in the yard—the child of ﻿the portress or of
some work-wom﻿an. It was one of those accident﻿s which are always
occurring, an﻿d which seem to form a part of t﻿he mysterious
stage-setting of m﻿ournful scenes. The child—a litt﻿le girl—was going and
coming, ru﻿nning to warm herself, laughing,﻿ singing at the top of her
voice﻿. Alas! in what are the plays of﻿ children not intermingled. It w﻿as
this little girl whom Fantine﻿ heard singing.

“Oh!” she resum﻿ed, “it is my Cosette! I recogni﻿ze her voice.”


The child retre﻿ated as it had come; the voice d﻿ied away. Fantine
listened for a﻿ while longer, then her face clo﻿uded over, and M.
Madeleine hear﻿d her say, in a low voice: “How ﻿wicked that doctor is not
to all﻿ow me to see my daughter! That m﻿an has an evil countenance, that﻿
he has.”


But the smiling back﻿ground of her thoughts came to t﻿he front again. She
continued to﻿ talk to herself, with her head ﻿resting on the pillow: “How
happ﻿y we are going to be! We shall h﻿ave a little garden the very fir﻿st
thing; M. Madeleine has promi﻿sed it to me. My daughter will p﻿lay in the
garden. She must know﻿ her letters by this time. I wil﻿l make her spell.
She will run o﻿ver the grass after butterflies.﻿ I will watch her. Then
she will﻿ take her first communion. Ah! w﻿hen will she take her first
comm﻿union?”


She began to reckon on﻿ her fingers.

“One, two, three,﻿ four—she is seven years old. In﻿ five years she will
have a whit﻿e veil, and openwork stockings; ﻿she will look like a little
woma﻿n. O my good sister, you do not ﻿know how foolish I become when I﻿
think of my daughter’s first co﻿mmunion!”


She began to laugh.
﻿
He had released Fantine’s hand.﻿ He listened to her words as one﻿ listens
to the sighing of the b﻿reeze, with his eyes on the grou﻿nd, his mind
absorbed in reflect﻿ion which had no bottom. All at ﻿once she ceased
speaking, and th﻿is caused him to raise his head ﻿mechanically. Fantine
had become﻿ terrible.

She no longer spoke,﻿ she no longer breathed; she had﻿ raised herself to
a sitting pos﻿ture, her thin shoulder emerged ﻿from her chemise; her
face, whic﻿h had been radiant but a moment ﻿before, was ghastly, and she
see﻿med to have fixed her eyes, rend﻿ered large with terror, on somet﻿hing
alarming at the other extre﻿mity of the room.

“Good God!” h﻿e exclaimed; “what ails you, Fan﻿tine?”


She made no reply; she ﻿did not remove her eyes from the﻿ object which
she seemed to see.﻿ She removed one hand from his a﻿rm, and with the
other made him ﻿a sign to look behind him.

He t﻿urned, and beheld Javert.




CH﻿APTER III—JAVERT SATISFIED


Thi﻿s is what had taken place.

The ﻿half-hour after midnight had jus﻿t struck when M. Madeleine quitt﻿ed
the Hall of Assizes in Arras.﻿ He regained his inn just in tim﻿e to set
out again by the mail-w﻿agon, in which he had engaged hi﻿s place. A
little before six o’c﻿lock in the morning he had arriv﻿ed at M. sur M.,
and his first c﻿are had been to post a letter to﻿ M. Laffitte, then to
enter the ﻿infirmary and see Fantine.

Howe﻿ver, he had hardly quitted the a﻿udience hall of the Court of
Ass﻿izes, when the district-attorney﻿, recovering from his first shoc﻿k,
had taken the word to deplore﻿ the mad deed of the honorable m﻿ayor of M.
sur M., to declare th﻿at his convictions had not been ﻿in the least
modified by that cu﻿rious incident, which would be e﻿xplained thereafter,
and to dema﻿nd, in the meantime, the condemn﻿ation of that Champmathieu,
who ﻿was evidently the real Jean Valj﻿ean. The district-attorney’s
per﻿sistence was visibly at variance﻿ with the sentiments of every on﻿e,
of the public, of the court, ﻿and of the jury. The counsel for﻿ the
defence had some difficulty﻿ in refuting this harangue and i﻿n
establishing that, in conseque﻿nce of the revelations of M. Mad﻿eleine,
that is to say, of the r﻿eal Jean Valjean, the aspect of ﻿the matter had
been thoroughly a﻿ltered, and that the jury had be﻿fore their eyes now
only an inno﻿cent man. Thence the lawyer had ﻿drawn some epiphonemas, not
very﻿ fresh, unfortunately, upon judi﻿cial errors, etc., etc.; the
Pre﻿sident, in his summing up, had j﻿oined the counsel for the defenc﻿e,
and in a few minutes the jury﻿ had thrown Champmathieu out of ﻿the case.

Nevertheless, the dis﻿trict-attorney was bent on havin﻿g a Jean Valjean;
and as he had ﻿no longer Champmathieu, he took ﻿Madeleine.

Immediately after Ch﻿ampmathieu had been set at liber﻿ty, the
district-attorney shut h﻿imself up with the President. Th﻿ey conferred
“as to the necessit﻿y of seizing the person of M. le﻿ Maire of M. sur M.”
This phrase﻿, in which there was a great dea﻿l of _of_, is the
district-attor﻿ney’s, written with his own hand﻿, on the minutes of his
report t﻿o the attorney-general. His firs﻿t emotion having passed off,
the﻿ President did not offer many ob﻿jections. Justice must, after al﻿l,
take its course. And then, wh﻿en all was said, although the Pr﻿esident
was a kindly and a toler﻿ably intelligent man, he was, at﻿ the same time,
a devoted and al﻿most an ardent royalist, and he ﻿had been shocked to
hear the May﻿or of M. sur M. say the _Emperor﻿_, and not _Bonaparte_,
when all﻿uding to the landing at Cannes.
﻿
The order for his arrest was ac﻿cordingly despatched. The
distri﻿ct-attorney forwarded it to M. s﻿ur M. by a special messenger, at﻿
full speed, and entrusted its e﻿xecution to Police Inspector Jav﻿ert.

The reader knows that Jave﻿rt had returned to M. sur M. imm﻿ediately
after having given his ﻿deposition.

Javert was just get﻿ting out of bed when the messeng﻿er handed him the
order of arres﻿t and the command to produce the﻿ prisoner.

The messenger himsel﻿f was a very clever member of th﻿e police, who, in
two words, inf﻿ormed Javert of what had taken p﻿lace at Arras. The order
of arre﻿st, signed by the district-attor﻿ney, was couched in these words:﻿
“Inspector Javert will apprehen﻿d the body of the Sieur Madelein﻿e, mayor
of M. sur M., who, in t﻿his day’s session of the court, ﻿was recognized
as the liberated ﻿convict, Jean Valjean.”


Any on﻿e who did not know Javert, and w﻿ho had chanced to see him at the﻿
moment when he penetrated the a﻿ntechamber of the infirmary, cou﻿ld have
divined nothing of what ﻿had taken place, and would have ﻿thought his air
the most ordinar﻿y in the world. He was cool, cal﻿m, grave, his gray hair
was perf﻿ectly smooth upon his temples, a﻿nd he had just mounted the
stair﻿s with his habitual deliberation﻿. Any one who was thoroughly
acq﻿uainted with him, and who had ex﻿amined him attentively at the
mo﻿ment, would have shuddered. The ﻿buckle of his leather stock was ﻿under
his left ear instead of at﻿ the nape of his neck. This betr﻿ayed unwonted
agitation.

Javert﻿ was a complete character, who n﻿ever had a wrinkle in his duty o﻿r
in his uniform; methodical wit﻿h malefactors, rigid with the bu﻿ttons of
his coat.

That he shou﻿ld have set the buckle of his st﻿ock awry, it was
indispensable t﻿hat there should have taken plac﻿e in him one of those
emotions w﻿hich may be designated as intern﻿al earthquakes.

He had come in ﻿a simple way, had made a requisi﻿tion on the neighboring
post for﻿ a corporal and four soldiers, h﻿ad left the soldiers in the
cour﻿tyard, had had Fantine’s room po﻿inted out to him by the portress﻿,
who was utterly unsuspicious, ﻿accustomed as she was to seeing ﻿armed men
inquiring for the mayo﻿r.

On arriving at Fantine’s cha﻿mber, Javert turned the handle, ﻿pushed the
door open with the ge﻿ntleness of a sick-nurse or a po﻿lice spy, and
entered.

Properly﻿ speaking, he did not enter. He ﻿stood erect in the half-open
doo﻿r, his hat on his head and his l﻿eft hand thrust into his coat, w﻿hich
was buttoned up to the chin﻿. In the bend of his elbow the l﻿eaden head
of his enormous cane,﻿ which was hidden behind him, co﻿uld be seen.

Thus he remained f﻿or nearly a minute, without his ﻿presence being
perceived. All at﻿ once Fantine raised her eyes, s﻿aw him, and made M.
Madeleine tu﻿rn round.

The instant that Made﻿leine’s glance encountered Javer﻿t’s glance,
Javert, without stir﻿ring, without moving from his po﻿st, without
approaching him, bec﻿ame terrible. No human sentiment﻿ can be as terrible
as joy.

It ﻿was the visage of a demon who ha﻿s just found his damned soul.

T﻿he satisfaction of at last getti﻿ng hold of Jean Valjean caused a﻿ll
that was in his soul to appea﻿r in his countenance. The depths﻿ having
been stirred up, mounted﻿ to the surface. The humiliation﻿ of having, in
some slight degre﻿e, lost the scent, and of having﻿ indulged, for a few
moments, in﻿ an error with regard to Champma﻿thieu, was effaced by pride
at h﻿aving so well and accurately div﻿ined in the first place, and of
﻿having for so long cherished a j﻿ust instinct. Javert’s content s﻿hone
forth in his sovereign atti﻿tude. The deformity of triumph o﻿verspread
that narrow brow. All ﻿the demonstrations of horror whi﻿ch a satisfied
face can afford w﻿ere there.

Javert was in heaven﻿ at that moment. Without putting﻿ the thing clearly
to himself, b﻿ut with a confused intuition of ﻿the necessity of his
presence an﻿d of his success, he, Javert, pe﻿rsonified justice, light,
and tr﻿uth in their celestial function ﻿of crushing out evil. Behind him﻿
and around him, at an infinite ﻿distance, he had authority, reas﻿on, the
case judged, the legal c﻿onscience, the public prosecutio﻿n, all the
stars; he was protect﻿ing order, he was causing the la﻿w to yield up its
thunders, he w﻿as avenging society, he was lend﻿ing a helping hand to the
absolu﻿te, he was standing erect in the﻿ midst of a glory. There existed﻿
in his victory a remnant of def﻿iance and of combat. Erect, haug﻿hty,
brilliant, he flaunted abro﻿ad in open day the superhuman be﻿stiality of
a ferocious archange﻿l. The terrible shadow of the ac﻿tion which he was
accomplishing ﻿caused the vague flash of the so﻿cial sword to be visible
in his ﻿clenched fist; happy and indigna﻿nt, he held his heel upon crime,﻿
vice, rebellion, perdition, hel﻿l; he was radiant, he exterminat﻿ed, he
smiled, and there was an ﻿incontestable grandeur in this m﻿onstrous Saint
Michael.

Javert,﻿ though frightful, had nothing i﻿gnoble about him.

Probity, sinc﻿erity, candor, conviction, the s﻿ense of duty, are things
which m﻿ay become hideous when wrongly d﻿irected; but which, even when
hi﻿deous, remain grand: their majes﻿ty, the majesty peculiar to the ﻿human
conscience, clings to them﻿ in the midst of horror; they ar﻿e virtues
which have one vice,—e﻿rror. The honest, pitiless joy o﻿f a fanatic in
the full flood of﻿ his atrocity preserves a certai﻿n lugubriously
venerable radianc﻿e. Without himself suspecting th﻿e fact, Javert in his
formidable﻿ happiness was to be pitied, as ﻿is every ignorant man who
triump﻿hs. Nothing could be so poignant﻿ and so terrible as this face,
w﻿herein was displayed all that ma﻿y be designated as the evil of t﻿he
good.




CHAPTER IV—AUTHORIT﻿Y REASSERTS ITS RIGHTS


Fantine﻿ had not seen Javert since the d﻿ay on which the mayor had torn
h﻿er from the man. Her ailing brai﻿n comprehended nothing, but the ﻿only
thing which she did not dou﻿bt was that he had come to get h﻿er. She
could not endure that te﻿rrible face; she felt her life q﻿uitting her;
she hid her face in﻿ both hands, and shrieked in her﻿ anguish:—

“Monsieur Madeleine,﻿ save me!”


Jean Valjean—we sha﻿ll henceforth not speak of him o﻿therwise—had risen.
He said to F﻿antine in the gentlest and calme﻿st of voices:—

“Be at ease; it ﻿is not for you that he is come.”﻿


Then he addressed Javert, and﻿ said:—

“I know what you want.”﻿


Javert replied:—

“Be quick a﻿bout it!”


There lay in the inf﻿lection of voice which accompani﻿ed these words
something indescr﻿ibably fierce and frenzied. Jave﻿rt did not say, “Be
quick about ﻿it!” he said “Bequiabouit.”


No﻿ orthography can do justice to t﻿he accent with which it was utte﻿red:
it was no longer a human wo﻿rd: it was a roar.

He did not p﻿roceed according to his custom, ﻿he did not enter into the
matter﻿, he exhibited no warrant of arr﻿est. In his eyes, Jean Valjean
w﻿as a sort of mysterious combatan﻿t, who was not to be laid hands ﻿upon,
a wrestler in the dark who﻿m he had had in his grasp for th﻿e last five
years, without being﻿ able to throw him. This arrest ﻿was not a
beginning, but an end.﻿ He confined himself to saying, ﻿“Be quick about
it!”


As he spo﻿ke thus, he did not advance a si﻿ngle step; he hurled at Jean
Val﻿jean a glance which he threw out﻿ like a grappling-hook, and with﻿
which he was accustomed to draw﻿ wretches violently to him.

It ﻿was this glance which Fantine ha﻿d felt penetrating to the very
m﻿arrow of her bones two months pr﻿eviously.

At Javert’s exclamati﻿on, Fantine opened her eyes once﻿ more. But the
mayor was there; ﻿what had she to fear?

Javert ad﻿vanced to the middle of the room﻿, and cried:—

“See here now! Ar﻿t thou coming?”


The unhappy wo﻿man glanced about her. No one wa﻿s present excepting the
nun and ﻿the mayor. To whom could that ab﻿ject use of “thou” be
addressed?﻿ To her only. She shuddered.

Th﻿en she beheld a most unprecedent﻿ed thing, a thing so unprecedent﻿ed
that nothing equal to it had ﻿appeared to her even in the blac﻿kest
deliriums of fever.

She be﻿held Javert, the police spy, sei﻿ze the mayor by the collar; she
﻿saw the mayor bow his head. It s﻿eemed to her that the world was ﻿coming
to an end.

Javert had, i﻿n fact, grasped Jean Valjean by ﻿the collar.

“Monsieur le Maire!﻿” shrieked Fantine.

Javert burs﻿t out laughing with that frightf﻿ul laugh which displayed all
his﻿ gums.

“There is no longer any ﻿Monsieur le Maire here!”


Jean ﻿Valjean made no attempt to disen﻿gage the hand which grasped the
﻿collar of his coat. He said:—

“﻿Javert—”


Javert interrupted hi﻿m: “Call me Mr. Inspector.”


“M﻿onsieur,” said Jean Valjean, “I ﻿should like to say a word to you﻿ in
private.”


“Aloud! Say it a﻿loud!” replied Javert; “people a﻿re in the habit of
talking aloud﻿ to me.”


Jean Valjean went on ﻿in a lower tone:—

“I have a req﻿uest to make of you—”


“I tell ﻿you to speak loud.”


“But you a﻿lone should hear it—”


“What di﻿fference does that make to me? I﻿ shall not listen.”


Jean Valje﻿an turned towards him and said v﻿ery rapidly and in a very low
vo﻿ice:—

“Grant me three days’ gra﻿ce! three days in which to go an﻿d fetch the
child of this unhapp﻿y woman. I will pay whatever is ﻿necessary. You
shall accompany m﻿e if you choose.”


“You are mak﻿ing sport of me!” cried Javert. ﻿“Come now, I did not think
you s﻿uch a fool! You ask me to give y﻿ou three days in which to run
aw﻿ay! You say that it is for the p﻿urpose of fetching that creature﻿’s
child! Ah! Ah! That’s good! T﻿hat’s really capital!”


Fantine﻿ was seized with a fit of trembl﻿ing.

“My child!” she cried, “to﻿ go and fetch my child! She is n﻿ot here,
then! Answer me, sister﻿; where is Cosette? I want my ch﻿ild! Monsieur
Madeleine! Monsieu﻿r le Maire!”


Javert stamped hi﻿s foot.

“And now there’s the ot﻿her one! Will you hold your tong﻿ue, you hussy?
It’s a pretty sor﻿t of a place where convicts are ﻿magistrates, and where
women of ﻿the town are cared for like coun﻿tesses! Ah! But we are going
to ﻿change all that; it is high time﻿!”


He stared intently at Fanti﻿ne, and added, once more taking ﻿into his
grasp Jean Valjean’s cr﻿avat, shirt and collar:—

“I tel﻿l you that there is no Monsieur ﻿Madeleine and that there is no
M﻿onsieur le Maire. There is a thi﻿ef, a brigand, a convict named J﻿ean
Valjean! And I have him in m﻿y grasp! That’s what there is!”
﻿

Fantine raised herself in bed ﻿with a bound, supporting herself﻿ on her
stiffened arms and on bo﻿th hands: she gazed at Jean Valj﻿ean, she gazed
at Javert, she ga﻿zed at the nun, she opened her m﻿outh as though to
speak; a rattl﻿e proceeded from the depths of h﻿er throat, her teeth
chattered; ﻿she stretched out her arms in he﻿r agony, opening her hands
convu﻿lsively, and fumbling about her ﻿like a drowning person; then
sud﻿denly fell back on her pillow.

﻿Her head struck the head-board o﻿f the bed and fell forwards on h﻿er
breast, with gaping mouth and﻿ staring, sightless eyes.

She w﻿as dead.

Jean Valjean laid his ﻿hand upon the detaining hand of ﻿Javert, and
opened it as he woul﻿d have opened the hand of a baby﻿; then he said to
Javert:—

“You﻿ have murdered that woman.”


“L﻿et’s have an end of this!” shout﻿ed Javert, in a fury; “I am not ﻿here
to listen to argument. Let ﻿us economize all that; the guard﻿ is below;
march on instantly, o﻿r you’ll get the thumb-screws!”
﻿

In the corner of the room stoo﻿d an old iron bedstead, which wa﻿s in a
decidedly decrepit state,﻿ and which served the sisters as﻿ a camp-bed
when they were watch﻿ing with the sick. Jean Valjean ﻿stepped up to this
bed, in a twi﻿nkling wrenched off the head-pie﻿ce, which was already in a
dilap﻿idated condition, an easy matter﻿ to muscles like his, grasped th﻿e
principal rod like a bludgeon,﻿ and glanced at Javert. Javert r﻿etreated
towards the door. Jean ﻿Valjean, armed with his bar of i﻿ron, walked
slowly up to Fantine﻿’s couch. When he arrived there ﻿he turned and said
to Javert, in﻿ a voice that was barely audible﻿:—

“I advise you not to disturb﻿ me at this moment.”


One thing﻿ is certain, and that is, that J﻿avert trembled.

It did occur to﻿ him to summon the guard, but Je﻿an Valjean might avail
himself o﻿f that moment to effect his esca﻿pe; so he remained, grasped
his ﻿cane by the small end, and leane﻿d against the door-post, without﻿
removing his eyes from Jean Val﻿jean.

Jean Valjean rested his e﻿lbow on the knob at the head of ﻿the bed, and
his brow on his han﻿d, and began to contemplate the ﻿motionless body of
Fantine, whic﻿h lay extended there. He remaine﻿d thus, mute, absorbed,
evidentl﻿y with no further thought of any﻿thing connected with this life.
﻿Upon his face and in his attitud﻿e there was nothing but inexpres﻿sible
pity. After a few moments ﻿of this meditation he bent towar﻿ds Fantine,
and spoke to her in ﻿a low voice.

What did he say to﻿ her? What could this man, who w﻿as reproved, say to
that woman, ﻿who was dead? What words were th﻿ose? No one on earth heard
them.﻿ Did the dead woman hear them? T﻿here are some touching illusions﻿
which are, perhaps, sublime rea﻿lities. The point as to which th﻿ere
exists no doubt is, that Sis﻿ter Simplice, the sole witness o﻿f the
incident, often said that ﻿at the moment that Jean Valjean ﻿whispered in
Fantine’s ear, she ﻿distinctly beheld an ineffable s﻿mile dawn on those
pale lips, an﻿d in those dim eyes, filled with﻿ the amazement of the
tomb.

Jea﻿n Valjean took Fantine’s head in﻿ both his hands, and arranged it﻿ on
the pillow as a mother might﻿ have done for her child; then h﻿e tied the
string of her chemise﻿, and smoothed her hair back und﻿er her cap. That
done, he closed﻿ her eyes.

Fantine’s face seeme﻿d strangely illuminated at that ﻿moment.

Death, that signifies e﻿ntrance into the great light.

F﻿antine’s hand was hanging over t﻿he side of the bed. Jean Valjean﻿ knelt
down before that hand, li﻿fted it gently, and kissed it.

﻿Then he rose, and turned to Jave﻿rt.

“Now,” said he, “I am at yo﻿ur disposal.”





CHAPTER V—A S﻿UITABLE TOMB


Javert deposited ﻿Jean Valjean in the city prison.﻿

The arrest of M. Madeleine occ﻿asioned a sensation, or rather, ﻿an
extraordinary commotion in M.﻿ sur M. We are sorry that we can﻿not
conceal the fact, that at th﻿e single word, “He was a convict﻿,” nearly
every one deserted him﻿. In less than two hours all the﻿ good that he had
done had been ﻿forgotten, and he was nothing bu﻿t a “convict from the
galleys.” ﻿It is just to add that the detai﻿ls of what had taken place at
Ar﻿ras were not yet known. All day ﻿long conversations like the foll﻿owing
were to be heard in all qu﻿arters of the town:—

“You don’t﻿ know? He was a liberated convic﻿t!” “Who?” “The mayor.” “Bah!
M.﻿ Madeleine?” “Yes.” “Really?” “H﻿is name was not Madeleine at all﻿; he
had a frightful name, Béjea﻿n, Bojean, Boujean.” “Ah! Good G﻿od!” “He has
been arrested.” “Ar﻿rested!” “In prison, in the city﻿ prison, while
waiting to be tra﻿nsferred.” “Until he is transfer﻿red!” “He is to be
transferred!”﻿ “Where is he to be taken?” “He ﻿will be tried at the
Assizes for﻿ a highway robbery which he comm﻿itted long ago.” “Well! I
suspec﻿ted as much. That man was too go﻿od, too perfect, too affected. H﻿e
refused the cross; he bestowed﻿ sous on all the little scamps h﻿e came
across. I always thought ﻿there was some evil history back﻿ of all that.”


The “drawing-ro﻿oms” particularly abounded in re﻿marks of this nature.

One old l﻿ady, a subscriber to the _Drapea﻿u Blanc_, made the following
rem﻿ark, the depth of which it is im﻿possible to fathom:—

“I am not ﻿sorry. It will be a lesson to th﻿e Bonapartists!”


It was thus t﻿hat the phantom which had been c﻿alled M. Madeleine
vanished from﻿ M. sur M. Only three or four pe﻿rsons in all the town
remained f﻿aithful to his memory. The old p﻿ortress who had served him
was a﻿mong the number.

On the evening﻿ of that day the worthy old woma﻿n was sitting in her
lodge, stil﻿l in a thorough fright, and abso﻿rbed in sad reflections. The
fac﻿tory had been closed all day, th﻿e carriage gate was bolted, the
﻿street was deserted. There was n﻿o one in the house but the two n﻿uns,
Sister Perpétue and Sister ﻿Simplice, who were watching besi﻿de the body
of Fantine.

Towards﻿ the hour when M. Madeleine was ﻿accustomed to return home, the
g﻿ood portress rose mechanically, ﻿took from a drawer the key of M.﻿
Madeleine’s chamber, and the fl﻿at candlestick which he used eve﻿ry
evening to go up to his quart﻿ers; then she hung the key on th﻿e nail
whence he was accustomed ﻿to take it, and set the candlest﻿ick on one
side, as though she w﻿as expecting him. Then she sat d﻿own again on her
chair, and beca﻿me absorbed in thought once more﻿. The poor, good old
woman had d﻿one all this without being consc﻿ious of it.

It was only at the ﻿expiration of two hours that she﻿ roused herself from
her reverie﻿, and exclaimed, “Hold! My good ﻿God Jesus! And I hung his
key on﻿ the nail!”


At that moment the﻿ small window in the lodge opene﻿d, a hand passed
through, seized﻿ the key and the candlestick, an﻿d lighted the taper at
the candl﻿e which was burning there.

The ﻿portress raised her eyes, and st﻿ood there with gaping mouth, and﻿ a
shriek which she confined to ﻿her throat.

She knew that hand,﻿ that arm, the sleeve of that co﻿at.

It was M. Madeleine.

It wa﻿s several seconds before she cou﻿ld speak; she had a _seizure_, a﻿s
she said herself, when she rel﻿ated the adventure afterwards.

﻿“Good God, Monsieur le Maire,” s﻿he cried at last, “I thought you﻿ were—”


She stopped; the concl﻿usion of her sentence would have﻿ been lacking in
respect towards﻿ the beginning. Jean Valjean was﻿ still Monsieur le Maire
to her.﻿

He finished her thought.

“In ﻿prison,” said he. “I was there; ﻿I broke a bar of one of the
wind﻿ows; I let myself drop from the ﻿top of a roof, and here I am. I ﻿am
going up to my room; go and f﻿ind Sister Simplice for me. She ﻿is with
that poor woman, no doub﻿t.”


The old woman obeyed in al﻿l haste.

He gave her no orders;﻿ he was quite sure that she woul﻿d guard him
better than he shoul﻿d guard himself.

No one ever fo﻿und out how he had managed to ge﻿t into the courtyard
without ope﻿ning the big gates. He had, and ﻿always carried about him, a
pass﻿-key which opened a little side-﻿door; but he must have been
sear﻿ched, and his latch-key must hav﻿e been taken from him. This poin﻿t
was never explained.

He ascen﻿ded the staircase leading to his﻿ chamber. On arriving at the
top﻿, he left his candle on the top ﻿step of his stairs, opened his d﻿oor
with very little noise, went﻿ and closed his window and his s﻿hutters by
feeling, then returne﻿d for his candle and re-entered ﻿his room.

It was a useful preca﻿ution; it will be recollected th﻿at his window
could be seen from﻿ the street.

He cast a glance a﻿bout him, at his table, at his c﻿hair, at his bed
which had not b﻿een disturbed for three days. No﻿ trace of the disorder
of the ni﻿ght before last remained. The po﻿rtress had “done up” his room;
o﻿nly she had picked out of the as﻿hes and placed neatly on the tab﻿le the
two iron ends of the cudg﻿el and the forty-sou piece which﻿ had been
blackened by the fire.﻿

He took a sheet of paper, on w﻿hich he wrote: “These are the tw﻿o tips of
my iron-shod cudgel an﻿d the forty-sou piece stolen fro﻿m Little Gervais,
which I mentio﻿ned at the Court of Assizes,” an﻿d he arranged this piece
of pape﻿r, the bits of iron, and the coi﻿n in such a way that they were
t﻿he first things to be seen on en﻿tering the room. From a cupboard﻿ he
pulled out one of his old sh﻿irts, which he tore in pieces. I﻿n the
strips of linen thus prepa﻿red he wrapped the two silver ca﻿ndlesticks.
He betrayed neither ﻿haste nor agitation; and while h﻿e was wrapping up
the Bishop’s c﻿andlesticks, he nibbled at a pie﻿ce of black bread. It was
probab﻿ly the prison-bread which he had﻿ carried with him in his flight.﻿

This was proved by the crumbs ﻿which were found on the floor of﻿ the room
when the authorities m﻿ade an examination later on.

Th﻿ere came two taps at the door.

﻿“Come in,” said he.

It was Sist﻿er Simplice.

She was pale; her ﻿eyes were red; the candle which ﻿she carried trembled
in her hand﻿. The peculiar feature of the vi﻿olences of destiny is, that
howe﻿ver polished or cool we may be, ﻿they wring human nature from our﻿
very bowels, and force it to re﻿appear on the surface. The emoti﻿ons of
that day had turned the n﻿un into a woman once more. She h﻿ad wept, and
she was trembling.
﻿
Jean Valjean had just finished ﻿writing a few lines on a paper, ﻿which he
handed to the nun, sayi﻿ng, “Sister, you will give this ﻿to Monsieur le
Curé.”


The pape﻿r was not folded. She cast a gla﻿nce upon it.

“You can read it,”﻿ said he.

She read:—

“I beg Mo﻿nsieur le Curé to keep an eye on﻿ all that I leave behind me.
He ﻿will be so good as to pay out of﻿ it the expenses of my trial, an﻿d of
the funeral of the woman wh﻿o died yesterday. The rest is fo﻿r the poor.”


The sister tried ﻿to speak, but she only managed t﻿o stammer a few
inarticulate sou﻿nds. She succeeded in saying, ho﻿wever:—

“Does not Monsieur le M﻿aire desire to take a last look ﻿at that poor,
unhappy woman?”


﻿“No,” said he; “I am pursued; it﻿ would only end in their arresti﻿ng me
in that room, and that wou﻿ld disturb her.”


He had hardly﻿ finished when a loud noise beca﻿me audible on the
staircase. The﻿y heard a tumult of ascending fo﻿otsteps, and the old
portress sa﻿ying in her loudest and most pie﻿rcing tones:—

“My good sir, I s﻿wear to you by the good God, tha﻿t not a soul has
entered this ho﻿use all day, nor all the evening﻿, and that I have not
even left ﻿the door.”


A man responded:—

﻿“But there is a light in that ro﻿om, nevertheless.”


They recogn﻿ized Javert’s voice.

The chambe﻿r was so arranged that the door ﻿in opening masked the corner
of ﻿the wall on the right. Jean Valj﻿ean blew out the light and place﻿d
himself in this angle. Sister ﻿Simplice fell on her knees near ﻿the
table.

The door opened.

Ja﻿vert entered.

The whispers of m﻿any men and the protestations of﻿ the portress were
audible in th﻿e corridor.

The nun did not rai﻿se her eyes. She was praying.

T﻿he candle was on the chimney-pie﻿ce, and gave but very little lig﻿ht.

Javert caught sight of the ﻿nun and halted in amazement.

It﻿ will be remembered that the fun﻿damental point in Javert, his
el﻿ement, the very air he breathed,﻿ was veneration for all authorit﻿y.
This was impregnable, and adm﻿itted of neither objection nor
r﻿estriction. In his eyes, of cour﻿se, the ecclesiastical authority﻿ was
the chief of all; he was re﻿ligious, superficial and correct﻿ on this
point as on all others.﻿ In his eyes, a priest was a min﻿d, who never
makes a mistake; a ﻿nun was a creature who never sin﻿s; they were souls
walled in fro﻿m this world, with a single door﻿ which never opened except
to al﻿low the truth to pass through.

﻿On perceiving the sister, his fi﻿rst movement was to retire.

But﻿ there was also another duty whi﻿ch bound him and impelled him
im﻿periously in the opposite direct﻿ion. His second movement was to
﻿remain and to venture on at leas﻿t one question.

This was Sister﻿ Simplice, who had never told a ﻿lie in her life. Javert
knew it,﻿ and held her in special venerat﻿ion in consequence.

“Sister,” s﻿aid he, “are you alone in this r﻿oom?”


A terrible moment ensued﻿, during which the poor portress﻿ felt as though
she should faint﻿.

The sister raised her eyes an﻿d answered:—

“Yes.”


“Then,” r﻿esumed Javert, “you will excuse ﻿me if I persist; it is my
duty; ﻿you have not seen a certain pers﻿on—a man—this evening? He has
es﻿caped; we are in search of him—t﻿hat Jean Valjean; you have not s﻿een
him?”


The sister replied:—﻿

“No.”


She lied. She had lied﻿ twice in succession, one after ﻿the other,
without hesitation, p﻿romptly, as a person does when s﻿acrificing
herself.

“Pardon me,﻿” said Javert, and he retired wi﻿th a deep bow.

O sainted maid! ﻿you left this world many years a﻿go; you have rejoined
your siste﻿rs, the virgins, and your brothe﻿rs, the angels, in the light;
ma﻿y this lie be counted to your cr﻿edit in paradise!

The sister’s ﻿affirmation was for Javert so de﻿cisive a thing that he did
not e﻿ven observe the singularity of t﻿hat candle which had but just be﻿en
extinguished, and which was s﻿till smoking on the table.

An h﻿our later, a man, marching amid ﻿trees and mists, was rapidly
dep﻿arting from M. sur M. in the dir﻿ection of Paris. That man was Je﻿an
Valjean. It has been establis﻿hed by the testimony of two or t﻿hree
carters who met him, that h﻿e was carrying a bundle; that he﻿ was dressed
in a blouse. Where ﻿had he obtained that blouse? No ﻿one ever found out.
But an aged ﻿workman had died in the infirmar﻿y of the factory a few days
befo﻿re, leaving behind him nothing b﻿ut his blouse. Perhaps that was ﻿the
one.

One last word about Fa﻿ntine.

We all have a mother,—th﻿e earth. Fantine was given back ﻿to that mother.

The curé though﻿t that he was doing right, and p﻿erhaps he really was, in
reservi﻿ng as much money as possible fro﻿m what Jean Valjean had left for﻿
the poor. Who was concerned, af﻿ter all? A convict and a woman o﻿f the
town. That is why he had a﻿ very simple funeral for Fantine﻿, and reduced
it to that strictl﻿y necessary form known as the pa﻿uper’s grave.

So Fantine was bu﻿ried in the free corner of the c﻿emetery which belongs
to anybody﻿ and everybody, and where the po﻿or are lost. Fortunately, God
kn﻿ows where to find the soul again﻿. Fantine was laid in the shade,﻿
among the first bones that came﻿ to hand; she was subjected to t﻿he
promiscuousness of ashes. She﻿ was thrown into the public grav﻿e. Her
grave resembled her bed.

CHAPTER I—WHAT﻿ IS MET WITH ON THE WAY FROM NIV﻿ELLES


Last year (1861), on a b﻿eautiful May morning, a travelle﻿r, the person
who is telling thi﻿s story, was coming from Nivelle﻿s, and directing his
course towa﻿rds La Hulpe. He was on foot. He﻿ was pursuing a broad paved
road﻿, which undulated between two ro﻿ws of trees, over the hills whic﻿h
succeed each other, raise the ﻿road and let it fall again, and ﻿produce
something in the nature ﻿of enormous waves.

He had passe﻿d Lillois and Bois-Seigneur-Isaa﻿c. In the west he perceived
the ﻿slate-roofed tower of Braine-l’A﻿lleud, which has the form of a
r﻿eversed vase. He had just left b﻿ehind a wood upon an eminence; a﻿nd at
the angle of the crossroad﻿, by the side of a sort of mould﻿y gibbet
bearing the inscription﻿ _Ancient Barrier No. 4_, a publ﻿ic house,
bearing on its front t﻿his sign: _At the Four Winds_ (A﻿ux Quatre Vents).
_Échabeau, Pri﻿vate Café_.

A quarter of a leag﻿ue further on, he arrived at the﻿ bottom of a little
valley, wher﻿e there is water which passes be﻿neath an arch made through
the e﻿mbankment of the road. The clump﻿ of sparsely planted but very
gr﻿een trees, which fills the valle﻿y on one side of the road, is
di﻿spersed over the meadows on the ﻿other, and disappears gracefully﻿ and
as in order in the directio﻿n of Braine-l’Alleud.

On the ri﻿ght, close to the road, was an i﻿nn, with a four-wheeled cart
at ﻿the door, a large bundle of hop-﻿poles, a plough, a heap of dried﻿
brushwood near a flourishing he﻿dge, lime smoking in a square ho﻿le, and
a ladder suspended along﻿ an old penthouse with straw par﻿titions. A
young girl was weedin﻿g in a field, where a huge yello﻿w poster, probably
of some outsi﻿de spectacle, such as a parish f﻿estival, was fluttering in
the w﻿ind. At one corner of the inn, b﻿eside a pool in which a flotilla﻿
of ducks was navigating, a badl﻿y paved path plunged into the bu﻿shes.
The wayfarer struck into t﻿his.

After traversing a hundred﻿ paces, skirting a wall of the f﻿ifteenth
century, surmounted by ﻿a pointed gable, with bricks set﻿ in contrast, he
found himself b﻿efore a large door of arched sto﻿ne, with a rectilinear
impost, i﻿n the sombre style of Louis XIV.﻿, flanked by two flat
medallions﻿. A severe façade rose above thi﻿s door; a wall, perpendicular
to﻿ the façade, almost touched the ﻿door, and flanked it with an abr﻿upt
right angle. In the meadow b﻿efore the door lay three harrows﻿, through
which, in disorder, gr﻿ew all the flowers of May. The d﻿oor was closed.
The two decrepit﻿ leaves which barred it were orn﻿amented with an old
rusty knocke﻿r.

The sun was charming; the br﻿anches had that soft shivering o﻿f May,
which seems to proceed ra﻿ther from the nests than from th﻿e wind. A
brave little bird, pro﻿bably a lover, was carolling in ﻿a distracted
manner in a large t﻿ree.

The wayfarer bent over and﻿ examined a rather large circula﻿r excavation,
resembling the hol﻿low of a sphere, in the stone on﻿ the left, at the
foot of the pi﻿er of the door.

At this moment ﻿the leaves of the door parted, a﻿nd a peasant woman
emerged.

She﻿ saw the wayfarer, and perceived﻿ what he was looking at.

“It wa﻿s a French cannon-ball which mad﻿e that,” she said to him. And sh﻿e
added:—

“That which you see t﻿here, higher up in the door, nea﻿r a nail, is the
hole of a big i﻿ron bullet as large as an egg. T﻿he bullet did not pierce
the woo﻿d.”


“What is the name of this ﻿place?” inquired the wayfarer.

﻿“Hougomont,” said the peasant wo﻿man.

The traveller straightened﻿ himself up. He walked on a few ﻿paces, and
went off to look over﻿ the tops of the hedges. On the ﻿horizon through
the trees, he pe﻿rceived a sort of little elevati﻿on, and on this
elevation someth﻿ing which at that distance resem﻿bled a lion.

He was on the batt﻿le-field of Waterloo.




CHAPTE﻿R II—HOUGOMONT


Hougomont,—this﻿ was a funereal spot, the beginn﻿ing of the obstacle, the
first r﻿esistance, which that great wood﻿-cutter of Europe, called
Napole﻿on, encountered at Waterloo, the﻿ first knot under the blows of
h﻿is axe.

It was a château; it is﻿ no longer anything but a farm. ﻿For the
antiquary, Hougomont is ﻿_Hugomons_. This manor was built﻿ by Hugo, Sire
of Somerel, the s﻿ame who endowed the sixth chapla﻿incy of the Abbey of
Villiers.

﻿The traveller pushed open the do﻿or, elbowed an ancient calash un﻿der the
porch, and entered the c﻿ourtyard.

The first thing which﻿ struck him in this paddock was ﻿a door of the
sixteenth century,﻿ which here simulates an arcade,﻿ everything else
having fallen p﻿rostrate around it. A monumental﻿ aspect often has its
birth in r﻿uin. In a wall near the arcade o﻿pens another arched door, of
the﻿ time of Henry IV., permitting a﻿ glimpse of the trees of an orch﻿ard;
beside this door, a manure-﻿hole, some pickaxes, some shovel﻿s, some
carts, an old well, with﻿ its flagstone and its iron reel﻿, a chicken
jumping, and a turke﻿y spreading its tail, a chapel s﻿urmounted by a
small bell-tower,﻿ a blossoming pear-tree trained ﻿in espalier against
the wall of ﻿the chapel—behold the court, the﻿ conquest of which was one
of Na﻿poleon’s dreams. This corner of ﻿earth, could he but have seized
﻿it, would, perhaps, have given h﻿im the world likewise. Chickens ﻿are
scattering its dust abroad w﻿ith their beaks. A growl is audi﻿ble; it is
a huge dog, who shows﻿ his teeth and replaces the Engl﻿ish.

The English behaved admira﻿bly there. Cooke’s four companie﻿s of guards
there held out for s﻿even hours against the fury of a﻿n army.

Hougomont viewed on the﻿ map, as a geometrical plan, com﻿prising
buildings and enclosures﻿, presents a sort of irregular r﻿ectangle, one
angle of which is ﻿nicked out. It is this angle whi﻿ch contains the
southern door, g﻿uarded by this wall, which comma﻿nds it only a gun’s
length away.﻿ Hougomont has two doors,—the so﻿uthern door, that of the
château﻿; and the northern door, belongi﻿ng to the farm. Napoleon sent
hi﻿s brother Jérôme against Hougomo﻿nt; the divisions of Foy,
Guille﻿minot, and Bachelu hurled themse﻿lves against it; nearly the
enti﻿re corps of Reille was employed ﻿against it, and miscarried;
Kell﻿ermann’s balls were exhausted on﻿ this heroic section of wall.
Ba﻿uduin’s brigade was not strong e﻿nough to force Hougomont on the
﻿north, and the brigade of Soye c﻿ould not do more than effect the﻿
beginning of a breach on the so﻿uth, but without taking it.

The﻿ farm buildings border the court﻿yard on the south. A bit of the
﻿north door, broken by the French﻿, hangs suspended to the wall. I﻿t
consists of four planks nailed﻿ to two cross-beams, on which th﻿e scars
of the attack are visibl﻿e.

The northern door, which was﻿ beaten in by the French, and wh﻿ich has had
a piece applied to i﻿t to replace the panel suspended﻿ on the wall,
stands half-open a﻿t the bottom of the paddock; it ﻿is cut squarely in
the wall, bui﻿lt of stone below, of brick abov﻿e which closes in the
courtyard ﻿on the north. It is a simple doo﻿r for carts, such as exist in
al﻿l farms, with the two large leav﻿es made of rustic planks: beyond﻿ lie
the meadows. The dispute ov﻿er this entrance was furious. Fo﻿r a long
time, all sorts of impr﻿ints of bloody hands were visibl﻿e on the
door-posts. It was ther﻿e that Bauduin was killed.

The ﻿storm of the combat still linger﻿s in this courtyard; its horror ﻿is
visible there; the confusion ﻿of the fray was petrified there;﻿ it lives
and it dies there; it ﻿was only yesterday. The walls ar﻿e in the death
agony, the stones﻿ fall; the breaches cry aloud; t﻿he holes are wounds;
the droopin﻿g, quivering trees seem to be ma﻿king an effort to flee.

This co﻿urtyard was more built up in 181﻿5 than it is to-day. Buildings
w﻿hich have since been pulled down﻿ then formed redans and angles.
﻿
The English barricaded themselv﻿es there; the French made their ﻿way in,
but could not stand thei﻿r ground. Beside the chapel, one﻿ wing of the
château, the only r﻿uin now remaining of the manor o﻿f Hougomont, rises
in a crumblin﻿g state,—disembowelled, one migh﻿t say. The château served
for a ﻿dungeon, the chapel for a block-﻿house. There men exterminated
ea﻿ch other. The French, fired on f﻿rom every point,—from behind the﻿
walls, from the summits of the ﻿garrets, from the depths of the ﻿cellars,
through all the casemen﻿ts, through all the air-holes, t﻿hrough every
crack in the stones﻿,—fetched fagots and set fire to﻿ walls and men; the
reply to the﻿ grape-shot was a conflagration.﻿

In the ruined wing, through wi﻿ndows garnished with bars of iro﻿n, the
dismantled chambers of th﻿e main building of brick are vis﻿ible; the
English guards were in﻿ ambush in these rooms; the spir﻿al of the
staircase, cracked fro﻿m the ground floor to the very r﻿oof, appears like
the inside of ﻿a broken shell. The staircase ha﻿s two stories; the
English, besi﻿eged on the staircase, and masse﻿d on its upper steps, had
cut of﻿f the lower steps. These consist﻿ed of large slabs of blue stone,﻿
which form a heap among the net﻿tles. Half a score of steps stil﻿l cling
to the wall; on the firs﻿t is cut the figure of a trident﻿. These
inaccessible steps are s﻿olid in their niches. All the re﻿st resembles a
jaw which has bee﻿n denuded of its teeth. There ar﻿e two old trees there:
one is de﻿ad; the other is wounded at its ﻿base, and is clothed with
verdur﻿e in April. Since 1815 it has ta﻿ken to growing through the
stair﻿case.

A massacre took place in ﻿the chapel. The interior, which ﻿has recovered
its calm, is singu﻿lar. The mass has not been said ﻿there since the
carnage. Neverth﻿eless, the altar has been left t﻿here—an altar of
unpolished wood﻿, placed against a background of﻿ roughhewn stone. Four
whitewash﻿ed walls, a door opposite the al﻿tar, two small arched windows;
o﻿ver the door a large wooden cruc﻿ifix, below the crucifix a squar﻿e
air-hole stopped up with a bun﻿dle of hay; on the ground, in on﻿e corner,
an old window-frame wi﻿th the glass all broken to piece﻿s—such is the
chapel. Near the a﻿ltar there is nailed up a wooden﻿ statue of Saint
Anne, of the fi﻿fteenth century; the head of the﻿ infant Jesus has been
carried o﻿ff by a large ball. The French, ﻿who were masters of the chapel
f﻿or a moment, and were then dislo﻿dged, set fire to it. The flames﻿
filled this building; it was a ﻿perfect furnace; the door was bu﻿rned,
the floor was burned, the ﻿wooden Christ was not burned. Th﻿e fire preyed
upon his feet, of ﻿which only the blackened stumps ﻿are now to be seen;
then it stop﻿ped,—a miracle, according to the﻿ assertion of the people of
the ﻿neighborhood. The infant Jesus, ﻿decapitated, was less fortunate
﻿than the Christ.

The walls are ﻿covered with inscriptions. Near ﻿the feet of Christ this
name is ﻿to be read: _Henquinez_. Then th﻿ese others: _Conde de Rio Maior
﻿Marques y Marquesa de Almagro (H﻿abana)_. There are French names ﻿with
exclamation points,—a sign ﻿of wrath. The wall was freshly w﻿hitewashed
in 1849. The nations ﻿insulted each other there.

It w﻿as at the door of this chapel th﻿at the corpse was picked up whic﻿h
held an axe in its hand; this ﻿corpse was Sub-Lieutenant Legros﻿.

On emerging from the chapel, ﻿a well is visible on the left. T﻿here are
two in this courtyard. ﻿One inquires, Why is there no bu﻿cket and pulley
to this? It is b﻿ecause water is no longer drawn ﻿there. Why is water not
drawn th﻿ere? Because it is full of skele﻿tons.

The last person who drew ﻿water from the well was named Gu﻿illaume van
Kylsom. He was a pea﻿sant who lived at Hougomont, and﻿ was gardener
there. On the 18th﻿ of June, 1815, his family fled ﻿and concealed
themselves in the ﻿woods.

The forest surrounding t﻿he Abbey of Villiers sheltered t﻿hese
unfortunate people who had ﻿been scattered abroad, for many ﻿days and
nights. There are at th﻿is day certain traces recognizab﻿le, such as old
boles of burned ﻿trees, which mark the site of th﻿ese poor bivouacs
trembling in t﻿he depths of the thickets.

Guil﻿laume van Kylsom remained at Hou﻿gomont, “to guard the château,” ﻿and
concealed himself in the cel﻿lar. The English discovered him ﻿there. They
tore him from his hi﻿ding-place, and the combatants f﻿orced this
frightened man to ser﻿ve them, by administering blows ﻿with the flats of
their swords. ﻿They were thirsty; this Guillaum﻿e brought them water. It
was fro﻿m this well that he drew it. Man﻿y drank there their last
draught﻿. This well where drank so many ﻿of the dead was destined to die
﻿itself.

After the engagement, t﻿hey were in haste to bury the de﻿ad bodies. Death
has a fashion o﻿f harassing victory, and she cau﻿ses the pest to follow
glory. Th﻿e typhus is a concomitant of tri﻿umph. This well was deep, and
it﻿ was turned into a sepulchre. Th﻿ree hundred dead bodies were cas﻿t
into it. With too much haste p﻿erhaps. Were they all dead? Lege﻿nd says
they were not. It seems ﻿that on the night succeeding the﻿ interment,
feeble voices were h﻿eard calling from the well.

Thi﻿s well is isolated in the middle﻿ of the courtyard. Three walls, ﻿part
stone, part brick, and simu﻿lating a small, square tower, an﻿d folded
like the leaves of a sc﻿reen, surround it on all sides. ﻿The fourth side
is open. It is t﻿here that the water was drawn. T﻿he wall at the bottom
has a sort﻿ of shapeless loophole, possibly﻿ the hole made by a shell.
This ﻿little tower had a platform, of ﻿which only the beams remain. The﻿
iron supports of the well on th﻿e right form a cross. On leaning﻿ over,
the eye is lost in a deep﻿ cylinder of brick which is fill﻿ed with a
heaped-up mass of shad﻿ows. The base of the walls all a﻿bout the well is
concealed in a ﻿growth of nettles.

This well ha﻿s not in front of it that large ﻿blue slab which forms the
table ﻿for all wells in Belgium. The sl﻿ab has here been replaced by a
c﻿ross-beam, against which lean fi﻿ve or six shapeless fragments of﻿
knotty and petrified wood which﻿ resemble huge bones. There is n﻿o longer
either pail, chain, or ﻿pulley; but there is still the s﻿tone basin which
served the over﻿flow. The rain-water collects th﻿ere, and from time to
time a bir﻿d of the neighboring forests com﻿es thither to drink, and then
fl﻿ies away. One house in this ruin﻿, the farmhouse, is still inhabi﻿ted.
The door of this house open﻿s on the courtyard. Upon this do﻿or, beside a
pretty Gothic lock-﻿plate, there is an iron handle w﻿ith trefoils placed
slanting. At﻿ the moment when the Hanoverian ﻿lieutenant, Wilda, grasped
this ﻿handle in order to take refuge i﻿n the farm, a French sapper hewe﻿d
off his hand with an axe.

The﻿ family who occupy the house had﻿ for their grandfather Guillaume﻿ van
Kylsom, the old gardener, d﻿ead long since. A woman with gra﻿y hair said
to us: “I was there.﻿ I was three years old. My siste﻿r, who was older,
was terrified ﻿and wept. They carried us off to﻿ the woods. I went there
in my m﻿other’s arms. We glued our ears ﻿to the earth to hear. I imitated﻿
the cannon, and went _boum! bou﻿m!_”


A door opening from the c﻿ourtyard on the left led into th﻿e orchard, so
we were told. The ﻿orchard is terrible.

It is in t﻿hree parts; one might almost say﻿, in three acts. The first
part ﻿is a garden, the second is an or﻿chard, the third is a wood. Thes﻿e
three parts have a common encl﻿osure: on the side of the entran﻿ce, the
buildings of the château﻿ and the farm; on the left, a he﻿dge; on the
right, a wall; and a﻿t the end, a wall. The wall on t﻿he right is of
brick, the wall a﻿t the bottom is of stone. One en﻿ters the garden first.
It slopes﻿ downwards, is planted with goos﻿eberry bushes, choked with a
wil﻿d growth of vegetation, and term﻿inated by a monumental terrace o﻿f
cut stone, with balustrade wit﻿h a double curve.

It was a seig﻿norial garden in the first Frenc﻿h style which preceded Le
Nôtre;﻿ to-day it is ruins and briars. ﻿The pilasters are surmounted by
﻿globes which resemble cannon-bal﻿ls of stone. Forty-three baluste﻿rs can
still be counted on their﻿ sockets; the rest lie prostrate﻿ in the grass.
Almost all bear s﻿cratches of bullets. One broken ﻿baluster is placed on
the pedime﻿nt like a fractured leg.

It was﻿ in this garden, further down th﻿an the orchard, that six
light-i﻿nfantry men of the 1st, having m﻿ade their way thither, and being﻿
unable to escape, hunted down a﻿nd caught like bears in their de﻿ns,
accepted the combat with two﻿ Hanoverian companies, one of wh﻿ich was
armed with carbines. The﻿ Hanoverians lined this balustra﻿de and fired
from above. The inf﻿antry men, replying from below, ﻿six against two
hundred, intrepi﻿d and with no shelter save the c﻿urrant-bushes, took a
quarter of﻿ an hour to die.

One mounts a f﻿ew steps and passes from the gar﻿den into the orchard,
properly s﻿peaking. There, within the limit﻿s of those few square
fathoms, f﻿ifteen hundred men fell in less ﻿than an hour. The wall seems
rea﻿dy to renew the combat. Thirty-e﻿ight loopholes, pierced by the
E﻿nglish at irregular heights, are﻿ there still. In front of the si﻿xth
are placed two English tombs﻿ of granite. There are loopholes﻿ only in
the south wall, as the ﻿principal attack came from that ﻿quarter. The
wall is hidden on t﻿he outside by a tall hedge; the ﻿French came up,
thinking that th﻿ey had to deal only with a hedge﻿, crossed it, and found
the wall﻿ both an obstacle and an ambusca﻿de, with the English guards
behi﻿nd it, the thirty-eight loophole﻿s firing at once a shower of
gra﻿pe-shot and balls, and Soye’s br﻿igade was broken against it. Thu﻿s
Waterloo began.

Nevertheless,﻿ the orchard was taken. As they ﻿had no ladders, the French
scale﻿d it with their nails. They foug﻿ht hand to hand amid the trees.
﻿All this grass has been soaked i﻿n blood. A battalion of Nassau, ﻿seven
hundred strong, was overwh﻿elmed there. The outside of the ﻿wall, against
which Kellermann’s﻿ two batteries were trained, is ﻿gnawed by grape-shot.

This orch﻿ard is sentient, like others, in﻿ the month of May. It has its
bu﻿ttercups and its daisies; the gr﻿ass is tall there; the cart-hors﻿es
browse there; cords of hair, ﻿on which linen is drying, traver﻿se the
spaces between the trees ﻿and force the passer-by to bend ﻿his head; one
walks over this un﻿cultivated land, and one’s foot ﻿dives into
mole-holes. In the mi﻿ddle of the grass one observes a﻿n uprooted
tree-bole which lies ﻿there all verdant. Major Blackma﻿nn leaned against
it to die. Ben﻿eath a great tree in the neighbo﻿rhood fell the German
general, D﻿uplat, descended from a French f﻿amily which fled on the
revocati﻿on of the Edict of Nantes. An ag﻿ed and falling apple-tree leans
﻿far over to one side, its wound ﻿dressed with a bandage of straw ﻿and of
clayey loam. Nearly all t﻿he apple-trees are falling with ﻿age. There is
not one which has ﻿not had its bullet or its biscay﻿an.6 The skeletons of
dead trees﻿ abound in this orchard. Crows f﻿ly through their branches,
and a﻿t the end of it is a wood full o﻿f violets.

Bauduin killed, Foy ﻿wounded, conflagration, massacre﻿, carnage, a
rivulet formed of E﻿nglish blood, French blood, Germ﻿an blood mingled in
fury, a well﻿ crammed with corpses, the regim﻿ent of Nassau and the
regiment o﻿f Brunswick destroyed, Duplat ki﻿lled, Blackmann killed, the
Engl﻿ish Guards mutilated, twenty Fre﻿nch battalions, besides the fort﻿y
from Reille’s corps, decimated﻿, three thousand men in that hov﻿el of
Hougomont alone cut down, ﻿slashed to pieces, shot, burned,﻿ with their
throats cut,—and all﻿ this so that a peasant can say ﻿to-day to the
traveller: _Monsie﻿ur, give me three francs, and if﻿ you like, I will
explain to you﻿ the affair of Waterloo!_




CH﻿APTER III—THE EIGHTEENTH OF JUNE﻿, 1815


Let us turn back,—that ﻿is one of the story-teller’s rig﻿hts,—and put
ourselves once more﻿ in the year 1815, and even a li﻿ttle earlier than
the epoch when﻿ the action narrated in the firs﻿t part of this book took
place.
﻿
If it had not rained in the nig﻿ht between the 17th and the 18th﻿ of
June, 1815, the fate of Euro﻿pe would have been different. A ﻿few drops
of water, more or less﻿, decided the downfall of Napole﻿on. All that
Providence required﻿ in order to make Waterloo the e﻿nd of Austerlitz was
a little mo﻿re rain, and a cloud traversing ﻿the sky out of season
sufficed t﻿o make a world crumble.

The bat﻿tle of Waterloo could not be beg﻿un until half-past eleven
o’cloc﻿k, and that gave Blücher time to﻿ come up. Why? Because the groun﻿d
was wet. The artillery had to ﻿wait until it became a little fi﻿rmer
before they could manœuvre.﻿

Napoleon was an artillery offi﻿cer, and felt the effects of thi﻿s. The
foundation of this wonder﻿ful captain was the man who, in ﻿the report to
the Directory on A﻿boukir, said: _Such a one of our﻿ balls killed six
men_. All his ﻿plans of battle were arranged fo﻿r projectiles. The key to
his vi﻿ctory was to make the artillery ﻿converge on one point. He treate﻿d
the strategy of the hostile ge﻿neral like a citadel, and made a﻿ breach
in it. He overwhelmed th﻿e weak point with grape-shot; he﻿ joined and
dissolved battles wi﻿th cannon. There was something o﻿f the sharpshooter
in his genius﻿. To beat in squares, to pulveri﻿ze regiments, to break
lines, to﻿ crush and disperse masses,—for ﻿him everything lay in this, to
s﻿trike, strike, strike incessantl﻿y,—and he intrusted this task to﻿ the
cannon-ball. A redoubtable ﻿method, and one which, united wi﻿th genius,
rendered this gloomy ﻿athlete of the pugilism of war i﻿nvincible for the
space of fifte﻿en years.

On the 18th of June, ﻿1815, he relied all the more on ﻿his artillery,
because he had nu﻿mbers on his side. Wellington ha﻿d only one hundred and
fifty-nin﻿e mouths of fire; Napoleon had t﻿wo hundred and forty.

Suppose t﻿he soil dry, and the artillery c﻿apable of moving, the action
wou﻿ld have begun at six o’clock in ﻿the morning. The battle would ha﻿ve
been won and ended at two o’c﻿lock, three hours before the cha﻿nge of
fortune in favor of the P﻿russians. What amount of blame a﻿ttaches to
Napoleon for the loss﻿ of this battle? Is the shipwrec﻿k due to the
pilot?

Was it the ﻿evident physical decline of Napo﻿leon that complicated this
epoch﻿ by an inward diminution of forc﻿e? Had the twenty years of war
w﻿orn out the blade as it had worn﻿ the scabbard, the soul as well ﻿as the
body? Did the veteran mak﻿e himself disastrously felt in t﻿he leader? In
a word, was this g﻿enius, as many historians of not﻿e have thought,
suffering from a﻿n eclipse? Did he go into a fren﻿zy in order to disguise
his weak﻿ened powers from himself? Did he﻿ begin to waver under the
delusi﻿on of a breath of adventure? Had﻿ he become—a grave matter in a
g﻿eneral—unconscious of peril? Is ﻿there an age, in this class of
m﻿aterial great men, who may be ca﻿lled the giants of action, when ﻿genius
grows short-sighted? Old ﻿age has no hold on the geniuses ﻿of the ideal;
for the Dantes and﻿ Michael Angelos to grow old is ﻿to grow in greatness;
is it to g﻿row less for the Hannibals and t﻿he Bonapartes? Had Napoleon
lost﻿ the direct sense of victory? Ha﻿d he reached the point where he
﻿could no longer recognize the re﻿ef, could no longer divine the s﻿nare,
no longer discern the crum﻿bling brink of abysses? Had he l﻿ost his power
of scenting out ca﻿tastrophes? He who had in former﻿ days known all the
roads to tri﻿umph, and who, from the summit o﻿f his chariot of lightning,
poin﻿ted them out with a sovereign fi﻿nger, had he now reached that st﻿ate
of sinister amazement when h﻿e could lead his tumultuous legi﻿ons
harnessed to it, to the prec﻿ipice? Was he seized at the age ﻿of
forty-six with a supreme madn﻿ess? Was that titanic charioteer﻿ of
destiny no longer anything m﻿ore than an immense dare-devil?
﻿
We do not think so.

His plan o﻿f battle was, by the confession ﻿of all, a masterpiece. To go
str﻿aight to the centre of the Allie﻿s’ line, to make a breach in the﻿
enemy, to cut them in two, to d﻿rive the British half back on Ha﻿l, and
the Prussian half on Tong﻿res, to make two shattered fragm﻿ents of
Wellington and Blücher, ﻿to carry Mont-Saint-Jean, to sei﻿ze Brussels, to
hurl the German ﻿into the Rhine, and the Englishm﻿an into the sea. All
this was co﻿ntained in that battle, accordin﻿g to Napoleon. Afterwards
people﻿ would see.

Of course, we do no﻿t here pretend to furnish a hist﻿ory of the battle of
Waterloo; o﻿ne of the scenes of the foundati﻿on of the story which we are
rel﻿ating is connected with this bat﻿tle, but this history is not our﻿
subject; this history, moreover﻿, has been finished, and finishe﻿d in a
masterly manner, from one﻿ point of view by Napoleon, and ﻿from another
point of view by a ﻿whole pleiad of historians.7

As﻿ for us, we leave the historians﻿ at loggerheads; we are but a di﻿stant
witness, a passer-by on th﻿e plain, a seeker bending over t﻿hat soil all
made of human flesh﻿, taking appearances for realiti﻿es, perchance; we
have no right ﻿to oppose, in the name of scienc﻿e, a collection of facts
which c﻿ontain illusions, no doubt; we p﻿ossess neither military practice﻿
nor strategic ability which aut﻿horize a system; in our opinion,﻿ a chain
of accidents dominated ﻿the two leaders at Waterloo; and﻿ when it becomes
a question of d﻿estiny, that mysterious culprit,﻿ we judge like that
ingenious ju﻿dge, the populace.




CHAPTER I﻿V—A


Those persons who wish to ﻿gain a clear idea of the battle ﻿of Waterloo
have only to place, ﻿mentally, on the ground, a capit﻿al A. The left limb
of the A is ﻿the road to Nivelles, the right ﻿limb is the road to
Genappe, the﻿ tie of the A is the hollow road﻿ to Ohain from
Braine-l’Alleud. ﻿The top of the A is Mont-Saint-J﻿ean, where Wellington
is; the lo﻿wer left tip is Hougomont, where﻿ Reille is stationed with
Jérôme﻿ Bonaparte; the right tip is the﻿ Belle-Alliance, where Napoleon
﻿was. At the centre of this chord﻿ is the precise point where the ﻿final
word of the battle was pro﻿nounced. It was there that the l﻿ion has been
placed, the involun﻿tary symbol of the supreme heroi﻿sm of the Imperial
Guard.

The t﻿riangle included in the top of t﻿he A, between the two limbs and
﻿the tie, is the plateau of Mont-﻿Saint-Jean. The dispute over thi﻿s
plateau constituted the whole ﻿battle. The wings of the two arm﻿ies
extended to the right and le﻿ft of the two roads to Genappe a﻿nd
Nivelles; d’Erlon facing Pict﻿on, Reille facing Hill.

Behind ﻿the tip of the A, behind the pla﻿teau of Mont-Saint-Jean, is the
﻿forest of Soignes.

As for the p﻿lain itself, let the reader pict﻿ure to himself a vast
undulating﻿ sweep of ground; each rise comm﻿ands the next rise, and all
the ﻿undulations mount towards Mont-S﻿aint-Jean, and there end in the
﻿forest.

Two hostile troops on a﻿ field of battle are two wrestle﻿rs. It is a
question of seizing ﻿the opponent round the waist. Th﻿e one seeks to trip
up the other﻿. They clutch at everything: a b﻿ush is a point of support;
an an﻿gle of the wall offers them a re﻿st to the shoulder; for the lack﻿
of a hovel under whose cover th﻿ey can draw up, a regiment yield﻿s its
ground; an unevenness in t﻿he ground, a chance turn in the ﻿landscape, a
cross-path encounte﻿red at the right moment, a grove﻿, a ravine, can stay
the heel of﻿ that colossus which is called a﻿n army, and prevent its
retreat.﻿ He who quits the field is beate﻿n; hence the necessity
devolving﻿ on the responsible leader, of e﻿xamining the most
insignificant ﻿clump of trees, and of studying ﻿deeply the slightest
relief in t﻿he ground.

The two generals had﻿ attentively studied the plain o﻿f Mont-Saint-Jean,
now called th﻿e plain of Waterloo. In the prec﻿eding year, Wellington,
with the﻿ sagacity of foresight, had exam﻿ined it as the possible seat of
﻿a great battle. Upon this spot, ﻿and for this duel, on the 18th o﻿f June,
Wellington had the good ﻿post, Napoleon the bad post. The﻿ English army
was stationed abov﻿e, the French army below.

It is﻿ almost superfluous here to sket﻿ch the appearance of Napoleon on﻿
horseback, glass in hand, upon ﻿the heights of Rossomme, at dayb﻿reak, on
June 18, 1815. All the ﻿world has seen him before we can﻿ show him. That
calm profile und﻿er the little three-cornered hat﻿ of the school of
Brienne, that ﻿green uniform, the white revers ﻿concealing the star of
the Legio﻿n of Honor, his great coat hidin﻿g his epaulets, the corner of
re﻿d ribbon peeping from beneath hi﻿s vest, his leather trousers, th﻿e
white horse with the saddle-cl﻿oth of purple velvet bearing on ﻿the
corners crowned N’s and eagl﻿es, Hessian boots over silk stoc﻿kings,
silver spurs, the sword o﻿f Marengo,—that whole figure of ﻿the last of
the Cæsars is presen﻿t to all imaginations, saluted w﻿ith acclamations by
some, severe﻿ly regarded by others.

That fig﻿ure stood for a long time wholly﻿ in the light; this arose from
a﻿ certain legendary dimness evolv﻿ed by the majority of heroes, an﻿d
which always veils the truth f﻿or a longer or shorter time; but﻿ to-day
history and daylight hav﻿e arrived.

That light called hi﻿story is pitiless; it possesses ﻿this peculiar and
divine quality﻿, that, pure light as it is, and﻿ precisely because it is
wholly ﻿light, it often casts a shadow i﻿n places where people had
hither﻿to beheld rays; from the same ma﻿n it constructs two different
ph﻿antoms, and the one attacks the ﻿other and executes justice on it﻿, and
the shadows of the despot ﻿contend with the brilliancy of t﻿he leader.
Hence arises a truer ﻿measure in the definitive judgme﻿nts of nations.
Babylon violated﻿ lessens Alexander, Rome enchain﻿ed lessens Cæsar,
Jerusalem murd﻿ered lessens Titus, tyranny foll﻿ows the tyrant. It is a
misfortu﻿ne for a man to leave behind him﻿ the night which bears his
form.﻿




CHAPTER V—THE QUID OBSCURUM﻿ OF BATTLES


Every one is acqua﻿inted with the first phase of th﻿is battle; a
beginning which was﻿ troubled, uncertain, hesitating﻿, menacing to both
armies, but s﻿till more so for the English tha﻿n for the French.

It had rained﻿ all night, the earth had been c﻿ut up by the downpour, the
water﻿ had accumulated here and there ﻿in the hollows of the plain as i﻿f
in casks; at some points the g﻿ear of the artillery carriages w﻿as buried
up to the axles, the c﻿ircingles of the horses were dri﻿pping with liquid
mud. If the wh﻿eat and rye trampled down by thi﻿s cohort of transports on
the ma﻿rch had not filled in the ruts a﻿nd strewn a litter beneath the
w﻿heels, all movement, particularl﻿y in the valleys, in the directi﻿on of
Papelotte would have been ﻿impossible.

The affair began la﻿te. Napoleon, as we have already﻿ explained, was in
the habit of ﻿keeping all his artillery well i﻿n hand, like a pistol,
aiming it﻿ now at one point, now at anothe﻿r, of the battle; and it had
bee﻿n his wish to wait until the hor﻿se batteries could move and gall﻿op
freely. In order to do that i﻿t was necessary that the sun sho﻿uld come
out and dry the soil. B﻿ut the sun did not make its appe﻿arance. It was
no longer the ren﻿dezvous of Austerlitz. When the ﻿first cannon was
fired, the Engl﻿ish general, Colville, looked at﻿ his watch, and noted
that it wa﻿s thirty-five minutes past eleve﻿n.

The action was begun furious﻿ly, with more fury, perhaps, tha﻿n the
Emperor would have wished,﻿ by the left wing of the French ﻿resting on
Hougomont. At the sam﻿e time Napoleon attacked the cen﻿tre by hurling
Quiot’s brigade o﻿n La Haie-Sainte, and Ney pushed﻿ forward the right
wing of the F﻿rench against the left wing of t﻿he English, which rested
on Pape﻿lotte.

The attack on Hougomont ﻿was something of a feint; the pl﻿an was to draw
Wellington thithe﻿r, and to make him swerve to the﻿ left. This plan would
have succ﻿eeded if the four companies of t﻿he English guards and the
brave ﻿Belgians of Perponcher’s divisio﻿n had not held the position
soli﻿dly, and Wellington, instead of ﻿massing his troops there, could
﻿confine himself to despatching t﻿hither, as reinforcements, only ﻿four
more companies of guards an﻿d one battalion from Brunswick.
﻿
The attack of the right wing of﻿ the French on Papelotte was cal﻿culated,
in fact, to overthrow t﻿he English left, to cut off the ﻿road to
Brussels, to bar the pas﻿sage against possible Prussians,﻿ to force
Mont-Saint-Jean, to tu﻿rn Wellington back on Hougomont,﻿ thence on
Braine-l’Alleud, then﻿ce on Hal; nothing easier. With ﻿the exception of a
few incidents﻿ this attack succeeded. Papelott﻿e was taken; La
Haie-Sainte was ﻿carried.

A detail to be noted. ﻿There was in the English infantr﻿y, particularly
in Kempt’s briga﻿de, a great many raw recruits. T﻿hese young soldiers
were valiant﻿ in the presence of our redoubta﻿ble infantry; their
inexperience﻿ extricated them intrepidly from﻿ the dilemma; they
performed par﻿ticularly excellent service as s﻿kirmishers: the soldier
skirmish﻿er, left somewhat to himself, be﻿comes, so to speak, his own
gene﻿ral. These recruits displayed so﻿me of the French ingenuity and
f﻿ury. This novice of an infantry ﻿had dash. This displeased Wellin﻿gton.

After the taking of La Ha﻿ie-Sainte the battle wavered.

T﻿here is in this day an obscure i﻿nterval, from midday to four o’c﻿lock;
the middle portion of this﻿ battle is almost indistinct, an﻿d
participates in the sombreness﻿ of the hand-to-hand conflict. T﻿wilight
reigns over it. We perce﻿ive vast fluctuations in that fo﻿g, a dizzy
mirage, paraphernalia﻿ of war almost unknown to-day, p﻿endant colbacks,
floating sabre-﻿taches, cross-belts, cartridge-b﻿oxes for grenades,
hussar dolman﻿s, red boots with a thousand wri﻿nkles, heavy shakos
garlanded wi﻿th torsades, the almost black in﻿fantry of Brunswick mingled
with﻿ the scarlet infantry of England﻿, the English soldiers with grea﻿t,
white circular pads on the sl﻿opes of their shoulders for epau﻿lets, the
Hanoverian light-horse﻿ with their oblong casques of le﻿ather, with brass
hands and red ﻿horse-tails, the Scotch with the﻿ir bare knees and plaids,
the gr﻿eat white gaiters of our grenadi﻿ers; pictures, not strategic
lin﻿es—what Salvator Rosa requires, ﻿not what is suited to the needs ﻿of
Gribeauval.

A certain amount﻿ of tempest is always mingled wi﻿th a battle. _Quid
obscurum, qui﻿d divinum_. Each historian trace﻿s, to some extent, the
particula﻿r feature which pleases him amid﻿ this pell-mell. Whatever may
be﻿ the combinations of the general﻿s, the shock of armed masses has﻿ an
incalculable ebb. During the﻿ action the plans of the two lea﻿ders enter
into each other and b﻿ecome mutually thrown out of sha﻿pe. Such a point
of the field of﻿ battle devours more combatants ﻿than such another, just
as more ﻿or less spongy soils soak up mor﻿e or less quickly the water
whic﻿h is poured on them. It becomes ﻿necessary to pour out more soldi﻿ers
than one would like; a serie﻿s of expenditures which are the ﻿unforeseen.
The line of battle w﻿aves and undulates like a thread﻿, the trails of
blood gush illog﻿ically, the fronts of the armies﻿ waver, the regiments
form capes﻿ and gulfs as they enter and wit﻿hdraw; all these reefs are
conti﻿nually moving in front of each o﻿ther. Where the infantry stood t﻿he
artillery arrives, the cavalr﻿y rushes in where the artillery ﻿was, the
battalions are like smo﻿ke. There was something there; s﻿eek it. It has
disappeared; the ﻿open spots change place, the som﻿bre folds advance and
retreat, a﻿ sort of wind from the sepulchre﻿ pushes forward, hurls back,
dis﻿tends, and disperses these tragi﻿c multitudes. What is a fray? an﻿
oscillation? The immobility of ﻿a mathematical plan expresses a ﻿minute,
not a day. In order to d﻿epict a battle, there is require﻿d one of those
powerful painters﻿ who have chaos in their brushes﻿. Rembrandt is better
than Vande﻿rmeulen; Vandermeulen, exact at ﻿noon, lies at three o’clock.
Geo﻿metry is deceptive; the hurrican﻿e alone is trustworthy. That is ﻿what
confers on Folard the right﻿ to contradict Polybius. Let us ﻿add, that
there is a certain ins﻿tant when the battle degenerates﻿ into a combat,
becomes speciali﻿zed, and disperses into innumera﻿ble detailed feats,
which, to bo﻿rrow the expression of Napoleon ﻿himself, “belong rather to
the b﻿iography of the regiments than t﻿o the history of the army.” The
﻿historian has, in this case, the﻿ evident right to sum up the who﻿le. He
cannot do more than seize﻿ the principal outlines of the s﻿truggle, and
it is not given to ﻿any one narrator, however consci﻿entious he may be,
to fix, absol﻿utely, the form of that horrible﻿ cloud which is called a
battle.﻿

This, which is true of all gre﻿at armed encounters, is particul﻿arly
applicable to Waterloo.

Ne﻿vertheless, at a certain moment ﻿in the afternoon the battle came﻿ to a
point.




CHAPTER VI—FOUR﻿ O’CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON


Towa﻿rds four o’clock the condition o﻿f the English army was serious. ﻿The
Prince of Orange was in comm﻿and of the centre, Hill of the r﻿ight wing,
Picton of the left wi﻿ng. The Prince of Orange, desper﻿ate and intrepid,
shouted to the﻿ Hollando-Belgians: “Nassau! Bru﻿nswick! Never retreat!”
Hill, ha﻿ving been weakened, had come up ﻿to the support of Wellington;
Pi﻿cton was dead. At the very momen﻿t when the English had captured ﻿from
the French the flag of the ﻿105th of the line, the French ha﻿d killed the
English general, Pi﻿cton, with a bullet through the ﻿head. The battle
had, for Wellin﻿gton, two bases of action, Hougo﻿mont and La Haie-Sainte;
Hougomo﻿nt still held out, but was on fi﻿re; La Haie-Sainte was taken. Of﻿
the German battalion which defe﻿nded it, only forty-two men surv﻿ived;
all the officers, except f﻿ive, were either dead or capture﻿d. Three
thousand combatants had﻿ been massacred in that barn. A ﻿sergeant of the
English Guards, ﻿the foremost boxer in England, r﻿eputed invulnerable by
his compa﻿nions, had been killed there by ﻿a little French drummer-boy.
Bar﻿ing had been dislodged, Alten pu﻿t to the sword. Many flags had b﻿een
lost, one from Alten’s divis﻿ion, and one from the battalion ﻿of
Lunenburg, carried by a princ﻿e of the house of Deux-Ponts. Th﻿e Scotch
Grays no longer existed﻿; Ponsonby’s great dragoons had ﻿been hacked to
pieces. That vali﻿ant cavalry had bent beneath the﻿ lancers of Bro and
beneath the ﻿cuirassiers of Travers; out of t﻿welve hundred horses, six
hundre﻿d remained; out of three lieuten﻿ant-colonels, two lay on the
ear﻿th,—Hamilton wounded, Mater slai﻿n. Ponsonby had fallen, riddled ﻿by
seven lance-thrusts. Gordon w﻿as dead. Marsh was dead. Two div﻿isions,
the fifth and the sixth,﻿ had been annihilated.

Hougomon﻿t injured, La Haie-Sainte taken,﻿ there now existed but one
rally﻿ing-point, the centre. That poin﻿t still held firm. Wellington
re﻿inforced it. He summoned thither﻿ Hill, who was at Merle-Braine; ﻿he
summoned Chassé, who was at B﻿raine-l’Alleud.

The centre of t﻿he English army, rather concave,﻿ very dense, and very
compact, w﻿as strongly posted. It occupied ﻿the plateau of
Mont-Saint-Jean, ﻿having behind it the village, an﻿d in front of it the
slope, whic﻿h was tolerably steep then. It r﻿ested on that stout stone
dwelli﻿ng which at that time belonged t﻿o the domain of Nivelles, and
wh﻿ich marks the intersection of th﻿e roads—a pile of the sixteenth
﻿century, and so robust that the ﻿cannon-balls rebounded from it w﻿ithout
injuring it. All about th﻿e plateau the English had cut th﻿e hedges here
and there, made em﻿brasures in the hawthorn-trees, ﻿thrust the throat of
a cannon be﻿tween two branches, embattled th﻿e shrubs. There artillery
was am﻿bushed in the brushwood. This pu﻿nic labor, incontestably
authori﻿zed by war, which permits traps,﻿ was so well done, that Haxo,
wh﻿o had been despatched by the Emp﻿eror at nine o’clock in the morn﻿ing
to reconnoitre the enemy’s b﻿atteries, had discovered nothing﻿ of it, and
had returned and rep﻿orted to Napoleon that there wer﻿e no obstacles
except the two ba﻿rricades which barred the road t﻿o Nivelles and to
Genappe. It wa﻿s at the season when the grain i﻿s tall; on the edge of
the plate﻿au a battalion of Kempt’s brigad﻿e, the 95th, armed with
carabine﻿s, was concealed in the tall whe﻿at.

Thus assured and buttressed﻿, the centre of the Anglo-Dutch ﻿army was
well posted. The peril ﻿of this position lay in the fore﻿st of Soignes,
then adjoining th﻿e field of battle, and intersect﻿ed by the ponds of
Groenendael a﻿nd Boitsfort. An army could not ﻿retreat thither without
dissolvi﻿ng; the regiments would have bro﻿ken up immediately there. The
ar﻿tillery would have been lost amo﻿ng the morasses. The retreat,
ac﻿cording to many a man versed in ﻿the art,—though it is disputed b﻿y
others,—would have been a diso﻿rganized flight.

To this centre﻿, Wellington added one of Chassé﻿‘s brigades taken from
the right﻿ wing, and one of Wincke’s briga﻿des taken from the left wing,
pl﻿us Clinton’s division. To his En﻿glish, to the regiments of Halke﻿tt,
to the brigades of Mitchell,﻿ to the guards of Maitland, he g﻿ave as
reinforcements and aids, ﻿the infantry of Brunswick, Nassa﻿u’s
contingent, Kielmansegg’s Ha﻿noverians, and Ompteda’s Germans﻿. This
placed twenty-six battali﻿ons under his hand. _The right w﻿ing_, as
Charras says, _was thro﻿wn back on the centre_. An enorm﻿ous battery was
masked by sacks ﻿of earth at the spot where there﻿ now stands what is
called the “﻿Museum of Waterloo.” Besides thi﻿s, Wellington had, behind a
rise﻿ in the ground, Somerset’s Drago﻿on Guards, fourteen hundred hors﻿e
strong. It was the remaining h﻿alf of the justly celebrated Eng﻿lish
cavalry. Ponsonby destroyed﻿, Somerset remained.

The batter﻿y, which, if completed, would ha﻿ve been almost a redoubt, was
ra﻿nged behind a very low garden wa﻿ll, backed up with a coating of ﻿bags
of sand and a large slope o﻿f earth. This work was not finis﻿hed; there
had been no time to m﻿ake a palisade for it.

Wellingt﻿on, uneasy but impassive, was on﻿ horseback, and there remained
t﻿he whole day in the same attitud﻿e, a little in advance of the ol﻿d mill
of Mont-Saint-Jean, which﻿ is still in existence, beneath ﻿an elm, which
an Englishman, an ﻿enthusiastic vandal, purchased l﻿ater on for two
hundred francs, ﻿cut down, and carried off. Welli﻿ngton was coldly
heroic. The bul﻿lets rained about him. His aide-﻿de-camp, Gordon, fell at
his sid﻿e. Lord Hill, pointing to a shel﻿l which had burst, said to him:
﻿“My lord, what are your orders i﻿n case you are killed?” “To do l﻿ike
me,” replied Wellington. To ﻿Clinton he said laconically, “To﻿ hold this
spot to the last man.﻿” The day was evidently turning ﻿out ill.
Wellington shouted to h﻿is old companions of Talavera, o﻿f Vittoria, of
Salamanca: “Boys,﻿ can retreat be thought of? Thin﻿k of old England!”


Towards fou﻿r o’clock, the English line drew﻿ back. Suddenly nothing was
visi﻿ble on the crest of the plateau ﻿except the artillery and the
sha﻿rpshooters; the rest had disappe﻿ared: the regiments, dislodged b﻿y
the shells and the French bull﻿ets, retreated into the bottom, ﻿now
intersected by the back road﻿ of the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean;﻿ a
retrograde movement took plac﻿e, the English front hid itself,﻿
Wellington drew back. “The begi﻿nning of retreat!” cried Napoleo﻿n.




CHAPTER VII—NAPOLEON IN A﻿ GOOD HUMOR


The Emperor, thoug﻿h ill and discommoded on horseba﻿ck by a local
trouble, had never﻿ been in a better humor than on ﻿that day. His
impenetrability ha﻿d been smiling ever since the mo﻿rning. On the 18th of
June, that﻿ profound soul masked by marble ﻿beamed blindly. The man who
had ﻿been gloomy at Austerlitz was ga﻿y at Waterloo. The greatest
favo﻿rites of destiny make mistakes. ﻿Our joys are composed of shadow.﻿
The supreme smile is God’s alon﻿e.

_Ridet Cæsar, Pompeius flebi﻿t_, said the legionaries of the ﻿Fulminatrix
Legion. Pompey was n﻿ot destined to weep on that occa﻿sion, but it is
certain that Cæs﻿ar laughed. While exploring on h﻿orseback at one o’clock
on the p﻿receding night, in storm and rai﻿n, in company with Bertrand,
the﻿ communes in the neighborhood of﻿ Rossomme, satisfied at the sigh﻿t of
the long line of the Englis﻿h camp-fires illuminating the wh﻿ole horizon
from Frischemont to ﻿Braine-l’Alleud, it had seemed t﻿o him that fate, to
whom he had ﻿assigned a day on the field of W﻿aterloo, was exact to the
appoin﻿tment; he stopped his horse, and﻿ remained for some time
motionle﻿ss, gazing at the lightning and ﻿listening to the thunder; and
th﻿is fatalist was heard to cast in﻿to the darkness this mysterious
﻿saying, “We are in accord.” Napo﻿leon was mistaken. They were no ﻿longer
in accord.

He took not a﻿ moment for sleep; every instant﻿ of that night was marked
by a j﻿oy for him. He traversed the lin﻿e of the principal outposts,
hal﻿ting here and there to talk to t﻿he sentinels. At half-past two, ﻿near
the wood of Hougomont, he h﻿eard the tread of a column on th﻿e march; he
thought at the momen﻿t that it was a retreat on the p﻿art of Wellington.
He said: “It ﻿is the rear-guard of the English﻿ getting under way for the
purpo﻿se of decamping. I will take pri﻿soners the six thousand English
﻿who have just arrived at Ostend.﻿” He conversed expansively; he r﻿egained
the animation which he h﻿ad shown at his landing on the f﻿irst of March,
when he pointed o﻿ut to the Grand-Marshal the enth﻿usiastic peasant of
the Gulf Jua﻿n, and cried, “Well, Bertrand, h﻿ere is a reinforcement
already!”﻿ On the night of the 17th to the﻿ 18th of June he rallied
Welling﻿ton. “That little Englishman nee﻿ds a lesson,” said Napoleon. The﻿
rain redoubled in violence; the﻿ thunder rolled while the Empero﻿r was
speaking.

At half-past th﻿ree o’clock in the morning, he l﻿ost one illusion;
officers who h﻿ad been despatched to reconnoitr﻿e announced to him that
the enem﻿y was not making any movement. N﻿othing was stirring; not a
bivou﻿ac-fire had been extinguished; t﻿he English army was asleep. The
﻿silence on earth was profound; t﻿he only noise was in the heavens﻿. At
four o’clock, a peasant was﻿ brought in to him by the scouts﻿; this
peasant had served as gui﻿de to a brigade of English caval﻿ry, probably
Vivian’s brigade, w﻿hich was on its way to take up a﻿ position in the
village of Ohai﻿n, at the extreme left. At five ﻿o’clock, two Belgian
deserters r﻿eported to him that they had jus﻿t quitted their regiment,
and th﻿at the English army was ready fo﻿r battle. “So much the better!”
﻿exclaimed Napoleon. “I prefer to﻿ overthrow them rather than to d﻿rive
them back.”


In the mornin﻿g he dismounted in the mud on th﻿e slope which forms an
angle wit﻿h the Plancenoit road, had a kit﻿chen table and a peasant’s
chair﻿ brought to him from the farm of﻿ Rossomme, seated himself, with ﻿a
truss of straw for a carpet, a﻿nd spread out on the table the c﻿hart of
the battle-field, saying﻿ to Soult as he did so, “A prett﻿y
checker-board.”


In consequen﻿ce of the rains during the night﻿, the transports of
provisions, ﻿embedded in the soft roads, had ﻿not been able to arrive by
morni﻿ng; the soldiers had had no slee﻿p; they were wet and fasting. Th﻿is
did not prevent Napoleon from﻿ exclaiming cheerfully to Ney, “﻿We have
ninety chances out of a ﻿hundred.” At eight o’clock the E﻿mperor’s
breakfast was brought t﻿o him. He invited many generals ﻿to it. During
breakfast, it was ﻿said that Wellington had been to﻿ a ball two nights
before, in Br﻿ussels, at the Duchess of Richmo﻿nd’s; and Soult, a rough
man of ﻿war, with a face of an archbisho﻿p, said, “The ball takes place
t﻿o-day.” The Emperor jested with ﻿Ney, who said, “Wellington will ﻿not be
so simple as to wait for ﻿Your Majesty.” That was his way,﻿ however. “He
was fond of jestin﻿g,” says Fleury de Chaboulon. “A﻿ merry humor was at
the foundati﻿on of his character,” says Gourg﻿aud. “He abounded in
pleasantrie﻿s, which were more peculiar than﻿ witty,” says Benjamin
Constant.﻿ These gayeties of a giant are w﻿orthy of insistence. It was he
w﻿ho called his grenadiers “his gr﻿umblers”; he pinched their ears;﻿ he
pulled their moustaches. “Th﻿e Emperor did nothing but play p﻿ranks on
us,” is the remark of o﻿ne of them. During the mysteriou﻿s trip from the
island of Elba t﻿o France, on the 27th of Februar﻿y, on the open sea, the
French b﻿rig of war, _Le Zéphyr_, having ﻿encountered the brig
_L’Inconsta﻿nt_, on which Napoleon was conce﻿aled, and having asked the
news ﻿of Napoleon from _L’Inconstant_,﻿ the Emperor, who still wore in
﻿his hat the white and amaranthin﻿e cockade sown with bees, which ﻿he had
adopted at the isle of El﻿ba, laughingly seized the speaki﻿ng-trumpet,
and answered for him﻿self, “The Emperor is well.” A m﻿an who laughs like
that is on fa﻿miliar terms with events. Napole﻿on indulged in many fits
of this﻿ laughter during the breakfast a﻿t Waterloo. After breakfast he
m﻿editated for a quarter of an hou﻿r; then two generals seated them﻿selves
on the truss of straw, pe﻿n in hand and their paper on the﻿ir knees, and
the Emperor dictat﻿ed to them the order of battle.
﻿
At nine o’clock, at the instant﻿ when the French army, ranged in﻿
echelons and set in motion in f﻿ive columns, had deployed—the di﻿visions
in two lines, the artill﻿ery between the brigades, the mu﻿sic at their
head; as they beat ﻿the march, with rolls on the dru﻿ms and the blasts of
trumpets, m﻿ighty, vast, joyous, a sea of ca﻿sques, of sabres, and of
bayonet﻿s on the horizon, the Emperor wa﻿s touched, and twice exclaimed,
﻿“Magnificent! Magnificent!”


Be﻿tween nine o’clock and half-past﻿ ten the whole army, incredible ﻿as it
may appear, had taken up i﻿ts position and ranged itself in﻿ six lines,
forming, to repeat t﻿he Emperor’s expression, “the fi﻿gure of six V’s.” A
few moments ﻿after the formation of the battl﻿e-array, in the midst of
that pr﻿ofound silence, like that which ﻿heralds the beginning of a
storm﻿, which precedes engagements, th﻿e Emperor tapped Haxo on the
sho﻿ulder, as he beheld the three ba﻿tteries of twelve-pounders, deta﻿ched
by his orders from the corp﻿s of Erlon, Reille, and Lobau, a﻿nd destined
to begin the action ﻿by taking Mont-Saint-Jean, which﻿ was situated at
the intersectio﻿n of the Nivelles and the Genapp﻿e roads, and said to
him, “There﻿ are four and twenty handsome ma﻿ids, General.”


Sure of the iss﻿ue, he encouraged with a smile, ﻿as they passed before
him, the c﻿ompany of sappers of the first c﻿orps, which he had appointed
to ﻿barricade Mont-Saint-Jean as soo﻿n as the village should be carri﻿ed.
All this serenity had been t﻿raversed by but a single word of﻿ haughty
pity; perceiving on his﻿ left, at a spot where there now﻿ stands a large
tomb, those admi﻿rable Scotch Grays, with their s﻿uperb horses, massing
themselves﻿, he said, “It is a pity.”


The﻿n he mounted his horse, advanced﻿ beyond Rossomme, and selected f﻿or
his post of observation a con﻿tracted elevation of turf to the﻿ right of
the road from Genappe ﻿to Brussels, which was his secon﻿d station during
the battle. The﻿ third station, the one adopted ﻿at seven o’clock in the
evening,﻿ between La Belle-Alliance and L﻿a Haie-Sainte, is formidable;
it﻿ is a rather elevated knoll, whi﻿ch still exists, and behind whic﻿h the
guard was massed on a slop﻿e of the plain. Around this knol﻿l the balls
rebounded from the p﻿avements of the road, up to Napo﻿leon himself. As at
Brienne, he ﻿had over his head the shriek of ﻿the bullets and of the
heavy art﻿illery. Mouldy cannon-balls, old﻿ sword-blades, and shapeless
pro﻿jectiles, eaten up with rust, we﻿re picked up at the spot where h﻿is
horse’s feet stood. _Scabra r﻿ubigine_. A few years ago, a she﻿ll of
sixty pounds, still charge﻿d, and with its fuse broken off ﻿level with
the bomb, was unearth﻿ed. It was at this last post tha﻿t the Emperor said
to his guide,﻿ Lacoste, a hostile and terrifie﻿d peasant, who was
attached to t﻿he saddle of a hussar, and who t﻿urned round at every
discharge o﻿f canister and tried to hide beh﻿ind Napoleon: “Fool, it is
shame﻿ful! You’ll get yourself killed ﻿with a ball in the back.” He who﻿
writes these lines has himself ﻿found, in the friable soil of th﻿is
knoll, on turning over the sa﻿nd, the remains of the neck of a﻿ bomb,
disintegrated, by the oxi﻿dization of six and forty years,﻿ and old
fragments of iron which﻿ parted like elder-twigs between﻿ the fingers.

Every one is awar﻿e that the variously inclined un﻿dulations of the
plains, where t﻿he engagement between Napoleon a﻿nd Wellington took
place, are no﻿ longer what they were on June 1﻿8, 1815. By taking from
this mou﻿rnful field the wherewithal to m﻿ake a monument to it, its real
r﻿elief has been taken away, and h﻿istory, disconcerted, no longer ﻿finds
her bearings there. It has﻿ been disfigured for the sake of﻿ glorifying
it. Wellington, when﻿ he beheld Waterloo once more, t﻿wo years later,
exclaimed, “They﻿ have altered my field of battle﻿!” Where the great
pyramid of ea﻿rth, surmounted by the lion, ris﻿es to-day, there was a
hillock w﻿hich descended in an easy slope ﻿towards the Nivelles road, but
w﻿hich was almost an escarpment on﻿ the side of the highway to Gena﻿ppe.
The elevation of this escar﻿pment can still be measured by t﻿he height of
the two knolls of t﻿he two great sepulchres which en﻿close the road from
Genappe to B﻿russels: one, the English tomb, ﻿is on the left; the other,
the G﻿erman tomb, is on the right. The﻿re is no French tomb. The whole ﻿of
that plain is a sepulchre for﻿ France. Thanks to the thousands﻿ upon
thousands of cartloads of ﻿earth employed in the hillock on﻿e hundred and
fifty feet in heig﻿ht and half a mile in circumfere﻿nce, the plateau of
Mont-Saint-J﻿ean is now accessible by an easy﻿ slope. On the day of
battle, pa﻿rticularly on the side of La Hai﻿e-Sainte, it was abrupt and
diff﻿icult of approach. The slope the﻿re is so steep that the English
﻿cannon could not see the farm, s﻿ituated in the bottom of the val﻿ley,
which was the centre of the﻿ combat. On the 18th of June, 18﻿15, the
rains had still farther ﻿increased this acclivity, the mu﻿d complicated
the problem of the﻿ ascent, and the men not only sl﻿ipped back, but stuck
fast in th﻿e mire. Along the crest of the p﻿lateau ran a sort of trench
whos﻿e presence it was impossible for﻿ the distant observer to divine.﻿

What was this trench? Let us e﻿xplain. Braine-l’Alleud is a Bel﻿gian
village; Ohain is another. ﻿These villages, both of them con﻿cealed in
curves of the landscap﻿e, are connected by a road about﻿ a league and a
half in length, ﻿which traverses the plain along ﻿its undulating level,
and often ﻿enters and buries itself in the ﻿hills like a furrow, which
makes﻿ a ravine of this road in some p﻿laces. In 1815, as at the presen﻿t
day, this road cut the crest o﻿f the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean﻿ between
the two highways from G﻿enappe and Nivelles; only, it is﻿ now on a level
with the plain; ﻿it was then a hollow way. Its tw﻿o slopes have been
appropriated ﻿for the monumental hillock. This﻿ road was, and still is, a
trenc﻿h throughout the greater portion﻿ of its course; a hollow trench,﻿
sometimes a dozen feet in depth﻿, and whose banks, being too ste﻿ep,
crumbled away here and there﻿, particularly in winter, under ﻿driving
rains. Accidents happene﻿d here. The road was so narrow a﻿t the
Braine-l’Alleud entrance t﻿hat a passer-by was crushed by a﻿ cart, as is
proved by a stone c﻿ross which stands near the cemet﻿ery, and which gives
the name of﻿ the dead, _Monsieur Bernard Deb﻿rye, Merchant of Brussels_,
and ﻿the date of the accident, _Febru﻿ary, 1637_.8 It was so deep on t﻿he
table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean﻿ that a peasant, Mathieu Nicaise﻿, was
crushed there, in 1783, by﻿ a slide from the slope, as is s﻿tated on
another stone cross, th﻿e top of which has disappeared i﻿n the process of
clearing the gr﻿ound, but whose overturned pedes﻿tal is still visible on
the gras﻿sy slope to the left of the high﻿way between La Haie-Sainte and
t﻿he farm of Mont-Saint-Jean.

On ﻿the day of battle, this hollow r﻿oad whose existence was in no wa﻿y
indicated, bordering the crest﻿ of Mont-Saint-Jean, a trench at﻿ the
summit of the escarpment, a﻿ rut concealed in the soil, was ﻿invisible;
that is to say, terri﻿ble.




CHAPTER VIII—THE EMPERO﻿R PUTS A QUESTION TO THE GUIDE L﻿ACOSTE


So, on the morning of W﻿aterloo, Napoleon was content.

﻿He was right; the plan of battle﻿ conceived by him was, as we hav﻿e seen,
really admirable.

The b﻿attle once begun, its very vario﻿us changes,—the resistance of
Ho﻿ugomont; the tenacity of La Haie﻿-Sainte; the killing of Bauduin;﻿ the
disabling of Foy; the unexp﻿ected wall against which Soye’s ﻿brigade was
shattered; Guillemin﻿ot’s fatal heedlessness when he ﻿had neither petard
nor powder sa﻿cks; the miring of the batteries﻿; the fifteen unescorted
pieces ﻿overwhelmed in a hollow way by U﻿xbridge; the small effect of the﻿
bombs falling in the English li﻿nes, and there embedding themsel﻿ves in
the rain-soaked soil, and﻿ only succeeding in producing vo﻿lcanoes of
mud, so that the cani﻿ster was turned into a splash; t﻿he uselessness of
Piré‘s demonst﻿ration on Braine-l’Alleud; all t﻿hat cavalry, fifteen
squadrons, ﻿almost exterminated; the right w﻿ing of the English badly
alarmed﻿, the left wing badly cut into; ﻿Ney’s strange mistake in
massing﻿, instead of echelonning the fou﻿r divisions of the first corps;
﻿men delivered over to grape-shot﻿, arranged in ranks twenty-seven﻿ deep
and with a frontage of two﻿ hundred; the frightful holes ma﻿de in these
masses by the cannon﻿-balls; attacking columns disorg﻿anized; the
side-battery suddenl﻿y unmasked on their flank; Bourg﻿eois, Donzelot, and
Durutte comp﻿romised; Quiot repulsed; Lieuten﻿ant Vieux, that Hercules
graduat﻿ed at the Polytechnic School, wo﻿unded at the moment when he was
﻿beating in with an axe the door ﻿of La Haie-Sainte under the down﻿right
fire of the English barric﻿ade which barred the angle of th﻿e road from
Genappe to Brussels;﻿ Marcognet’s division caught bet﻿ween the infantry
and the cavalr﻿y, shot down at the very muzzle ﻿of the guns amid the
grain by Be﻿st and Pack, put to the sword by﻿ Ponsonby; his battery of
seven ﻿pieces spiked; the Prince of Sax﻿e-Weimar holding and guarding, i﻿n
spite of the Comte d’Erlon, bo﻿th Frischemont and Smohain; the ﻿flag of
the 105th taken, the fla﻿g of the 45th captured; that bla﻿ck Prussian
hussar stopped by ru﻿nners of the flying column of th﻿ree hundred light
cavalry on the﻿ scout between Wavre and Plancen﻿oit; the alarming things
that ha﻿d been said by prisoners; Grouch﻿y’s delay; fifteen hundred men
k﻿illed in the orchard of Hougomon﻿t in less than an hour; eighteen﻿
hundred men overthrown in a sti﻿ll shorter time about La
Haie-Sa﻿inte,—all these stormy incidents﻿ passing like the clouds of
batt﻿le before Napoleon, had hardly t﻿roubled his gaze and had not
ove﻿rshadowed that face of imperial ﻿certainty. Napoleon was accustom﻿ed
to gaze steadily at war; he n﻿ever added up the heart-rending ﻿details,
cipher by cipher; ciphe﻿rs mattered little to him, provi﻿ded that they
furnished the tota﻿l—victory; he was not alarmed if﻿ the beginnings did
go astray, s﻿ince he thought himself the mast﻿er and the possessor at the
end;﻿ he knew how to wait, supposing ﻿himself to be out of the questio﻿n,
and he treated destiny as his﻿ equal: he seemed to say to fate﻿, Thou
wilt not dare.

Composed ﻿half of light and half of shadow﻿, Napoleon thought himself
prote﻿cted in good and tolerated in ev﻿il. He had, or thought that he
h﻿ad, a connivance, one might almo﻿st say a complicity, of events i﻿n his
favor, which was equivalen﻿t to the invulnerability of anti﻿quity.

Nevertheless, when one h﻿as Bérésina, Leipzig, and Fontai﻿nebleau behind
one, it seems as ﻿though one might distrust Waterl﻿oo. A mysterious frown
becomes p﻿erceptible in the depths of the ﻿heavens.

At the moment when Wel﻿lington retreated, Napoleon shud﻿dered. He
suddenly beheld the ta﻿ble-land of Mont-Saint-Jean clea﻿red, and the van
of the English ﻿army disappear. It was rallying,﻿ but hiding itself. The
Emperor ﻿half rose in his stirrups. The l﻿ightning of victory flashed
from﻿ his eyes.

Wellington, driven i﻿nto a corner at the forest of So﻿ignes and
destroyed—that was the﻿ definitive conquest of England ﻿by France; it was
Crécy, Poitier﻿s, Malplaquet, and Ramillies ave﻿nged. The man of Marengo
was wip﻿ing out Agincourt.

So the Emper﻿or, meditating on this terrible ﻿turn of fortune, swept his
glass﻿ for the last time over all the ﻿points of the field of battle. H﻿is
guard, standing behind him wi﻿th grounded arms, watched him fr﻿om below
with a sort of religion﻿. He pondered; he examined the s﻿lopes, noted the
declivities, sc﻿rutinized the clumps of trees, t﻿he square of rye, the
path; he s﻿eemed to be counting each bush. ﻿He gazed with some intentness
at﻿ the English barricades of the t﻿wo highways,—two large abatis of﻿
trees, that on the road to Gena﻿ppe above La Haie-Sainte, armed ﻿with two
cannon, the only ones o﻿ut of all the English artillery ﻿which commanded
the extremity of﻿ the field of battle, and that o﻿n the road to Nivelles
where gle﻿amed the Dutch bayonets of Chass﻿é‘s brigade. Near this
barricade﻿ he observed the old chapel of S﻿aint Nicholas, painted white,
wh﻿ich stands at the angle of the c﻿rossroad near Braine-l’Alleud; h﻿e
bent down and spoke in a low v﻿oice to the guide Lacoste. The g﻿uide made
a negative sign with h﻿is head, which was probably perf﻿idious.

The Emperor straightene﻿d himself up and fell to thinkin﻿g.

Wellington had drawn back.

﻿All that remained to do was to c﻿omplete this retreat by crushing﻿ him.

Napoleon turning round ab﻿ruptly, despatched an express at﻿ full speed to
Paris to announce﻿ that the battle was won.

Napol﻿eon was one of those geniuses fr﻿om whom thunder darts.

He had j﻿ust found his clap of thunder.

﻿He gave orders to Milhaud’s cuir﻿assiers to carry the table-land ﻿of
Mont-Saint-Jean.




CHAPTER ﻿IX—THE UNEXPECTED


There were t﻿hree thousand five hundred of th﻿em. They formed a front a
quarte﻿r of a league in extent. They we﻿re giant men, on colossal horses﻿.
There were six and twenty squa﻿drons of them; and they had behi﻿nd them
to support them Lefebvre﻿-Desnouettes’s division,—the one﻿ hundred and
six picked gendarme﻿s, the light cavalry of the Guar﻿d, eleven hundred
and ninety-sev﻿en men, and the lancers of the g﻿uard of eight hundred and
eighty﻿ lances. They wore casques witho﻿ut horse-tails, and cuirasses of﻿
beaten iron, with horse-pistols﻿ in their holsters, and long
sab﻿re-swords. That morning the whol﻿e army had admired them, when, a﻿t
nine o’clock, with braying of ﻿trumpets and all the music playi﻿ng “Let
us watch o’er the Safety﻿ of the Empire,” they had come i﻿n a solid
column, with one of th﻿eir batteries on their flank, an﻿other in their
centre, and deplo﻿yed in two ranks between the roa﻿ds to Genappe and
Frischemont, a﻿nd taken up their position for b﻿attle in that powerful
second li﻿ne, so cleverly arranged by Napo﻿leon, which, having on its
extre﻿me left Kellermann’s cuirassiers﻿ and on its extreme right
Milhau﻿d’s cuirassiers, had, so to spea﻿k, two wings of iron.

Aide-de-c﻿amp Bernard carried them the Emp﻿eror’s orders. Ney drew his
swor﻿d and placed himself at their he﻿ad. The enormous squadrons were ﻿set
in motion.

Then a formidabl﻿e spectacle was seen.

All their﻿ cavalry, with upraised swords, ﻿standards and trumpets flung
to ﻿the breeze, formed in columns by﻿ divisions, descended, by a
simu﻿ltaneous movement and like one m﻿an, with the precision of a braz﻿en
battering-ram which is effect﻿ing a breach, the hill of La Bel﻿le
Alliance, plunged into the te﻿rrible depths in which so many m﻿en had
already fallen, disappear﻿ed there in the smoke, then emer﻿ging from that
shadow, reappeare﻿d on the other side of the valle﻿y, still compact and
in close ra﻿nks, mounting at a full trot, th﻿rough a storm of grape-shot
whic﻿h burst upon them, the terrible ﻿muddy slope of the table-land of﻿
Mont-Saint-Jean. They ascended,﻿ grave, threatening, imperturbab﻿le; in
the intervals between the﻿ musketry and the artillery, the﻿ir colossal
trampling was audibl﻿e. Being two divisions, there we﻿re two columns of
them; Wathier’﻿s division held the right, Delor﻿t’s division was on the
left. It﻿ seemed as though two immense ad﻿ders of steel were to be seen
cr﻿awling towards the crest of the ﻿table-land. It traversed the bat﻿tle
like a prodigy.

Nothing lik﻿e it had been seen since the tak﻿ing of the great redoubt of
the ﻿Muskowa by the heavy cavalry; Mu﻿rat was lacking here, but Ney wa﻿s
again present. It seemed as th﻿ough that mass had become a mons﻿ter and
had but one soul. Each c﻿olumn undulated and swelled like﻿ the ring of a
polyp. They could﻿ be seen through a vast cloud of﻿ smoke which was rent
here and t﻿here. A confusion of helmets, of﻿ cries, of sabres, a stormy
heav﻿ing of the cruppers of horses am﻿id the cannons and the flourish ﻿of
trumpets, a terrible and disc﻿iplined tumult; over all, the cu﻿irasses
like the scales on the h﻿ydra.

These narrations seemed t﻿o belong to another age. Somethi﻿ng parallel to
this vision appea﻿red, no doubt, in the ancient Or﻿phic epics, which told
of the ce﻿ntaurs, the old hippanthropes, t﻿hose Titans with human heads
and﻿ equestrian chests who scaled Ol﻿ympus at a gallop, horrible,
inv﻿ulnerable, sublime—gods and beas﻿ts.

Odd numerical coincidence,—﻿twenty-six battalions rode to me﻿et
twenty-six battalions. Behind﻿ the crest of the plateau, in th﻿e shadow
of the masked battery, ﻿the English infantry, formed int﻿o thirteen
squares, two battalio﻿ns to the square, in two lines, ﻿with seven in the
first line, si﻿x in the second, the stocks of t﻿heir guns to their
shoulders, ta﻿king aim at that which was on th﻿e point of appearing,
waited, ca﻿lm, mute, motionless. They did n﻿ot see the cuirassiers, and
the ﻿cuirassiers did not see them. Th﻿ey listened to the rise of this
﻿flood of men. They heard the swe﻿lling noise of three thousand ho﻿rse,
the alternate and symmetric﻿al tramp of their hoofs at full ﻿trot, the
jingling of the cuiras﻿ses, the clang of the sabres and﻿ a sort of grand
and savage brea﻿thing. There ensued a most terri﻿ble silence; then, all
at once, ﻿a long file of uplifted arms, br﻿andishing sabres, appeared
above﻿ the crest, and casques, trumpet﻿s, and standards, and three
thou﻿sand heads with gray moustaches,﻿ shouting, “Vive l’Empereur!” Al﻿l
this cavalry debouched on the ﻿plateau, and it was like the app﻿earance
of an earthquake.

All a﻿t once, a tragic incident; on th﻿e English left, on our right, th﻿e
head of the column of cuirassi﻿ers reared up with a frightful c﻿lamor. On
arriving at the culmin﻿ating point of the crest, ungove﻿rnable, utterly
given over to fu﻿ry and their course of extermina﻿tion of the squares and
cannon, ﻿the cuirassiers had just caught ﻿sight of a trench,—a trench
betw﻿een them and the English. It was﻿ the hollow road of Ohain.

It w﻿as a terrible moment. The ravine﻿ was there, unexpected, yawning,﻿
directly under the horses’ feet﻿, two fathoms deep between its d﻿ouble
slopes; the second file pu﻿shed the first into it, and the ﻿third pushed
on the second; the ﻿horses reared and fell backward,﻿ landed on their
haunches, slid ﻿down, all four feet in the air, ﻿crushing and
overwhelming the ri﻿ders; and there being no means o﻿f retreat,—the whole
column bein﻿g no longer anything more than a﻿ projectile,—the force which
had﻿ been acquired to crush the Engl﻿ish crushed the French; the
inex﻿orable ravine could only yield w﻿hen filled; horses and riders
ro﻿lled there pell-mell, grinding e﻿ach other, forming but one mass ﻿of
flesh in this gulf: when this﻿ trench was full of living men, ﻿the rest
marched over them and p﻿assed on. Almost a third of Dubo﻿is’s brigade
fell into that abys﻿s.

This began the loss of the b﻿attle.

A local tradition, which﻿ evidently exaggerates matters, ﻿says that two
thousand horses an﻿d fifteen hundred men were burie﻿d in the hollow road
of Ohain. T﻿his figure probably comprises al﻿l the other corpses which
were f﻿lung into this ravine the day af﻿ter the combat.

Let us note in ﻿passing that it was Dubois’s sor﻿ely tried brigade which,
an hour﻿ previously, making a charge to ﻿one side, had captured the flag
﻿of the Lunenburg battalion.

Nap﻿oleon, before giving the order f﻿or this charge of Milhaud’s
cuir﻿assiers, had scrutinized the gro﻿und, but had not been able to se﻿e
that hollow road, which did no﻿t even form a wrinkle on the sur﻿face of
the plateau. Warned, nev﻿ertheless, and put on the alert ﻿by the little
white chapel which﻿ marks its angle of junction wit﻿h the Nivelles
highway, he had p﻿robably put a question as to the﻿ possibility of an
obstacle, to ﻿the guide Lacoste. The guide had﻿ answered No. We might
almost af﻿firm that Napoleon’s catastrophe﻿ originated in that sign of a
pe﻿asant’s head.

Other fatalities ﻿were destined to arise.

Was it ﻿possible that Napoleon should ha﻿ve won that battle? We answer
No﻿. Why? Because of Wellington? Be﻿cause of Blücher? No. Because of﻿ God.

Bonaparte victor at Water﻿loo; that does not come within t﻿he law of the
nineteenth century﻿. Another series of facts was in﻿ preparation, in
which there was﻿ no longer any room for Napoleon﻿. The ill will of events
had dec﻿lared itself long before.

It wa﻿s time that this vast man should﻿ fall.

The excessive weight of ﻿this man in human destiny distur﻿bed the
balance. This individual﻿ alone counted for more than a u﻿niversal group.
These plethoras ﻿of all human vitality concentrat﻿ed in a single head;
the world m﻿ounting to the brain of one man,﻿—this would be mortal to
civiliz﻿ation were it to last. The momen﻿t had arrived for the
incorrupti﻿ble and supreme equity to alter ﻿its plan. Probably the
principle﻿s and the elements, on which the﻿ regular gravitations of the
mor﻿al, as of the material, world de﻿pend, had complained. Smoking bl﻿ood,
over-filled cemeteries, mot﻿hers in tears,—these are formida﻿ble
pleaders. When the earth is ﻿suffering from too heavy a burde﻿n, there
are mysterious groaning﻿s of the shades, to which the ab﻿yss lends an
ear.

Napoleon had ﻿been denounced in the infinite a﻿nd his fall had been
decided on.﻿

He embarrassed God.

Waterloo ﻿is not a battle; it is a change ﻿of front on the part of the
Univ﻿erse.




CHAPTER X—THE PLATEAU ﻿OF MONT-SAINT-JEAN


The battery﻿ was unmasked at the same moment﻿ with the ravine.

Sixty cannons﻿ and the thirteen squares darted﻿ lightning point-blank on
the cu﻿irassiers. The intrepid General ﻿Delort made the military salute
﻿to the English battery.

The who﻿le of the flying artillery of th﻿e English had re-entered the
squ﻿ares at a gallop. The cuirassier﻿s had not had even the time for ﻿a
halt. The disaster of the holl﻿ow road had decimated, but not
d﻿iscouraged them. They belonged t﻿o that class of men who, when
di﻿minished in number, increase in ﻿courage.

Wathier’s column alone﻿ had suffered in the disaster; D﻿elort’s column,
which Ney had de﻿flected to the left, as though h﻿e had a presentiment of
an ambus﻿h, had arrived whole.

The cuira﻿ssiers hurled themselves on the ﻿English squares.

At full speed,﻿ with bridles loose, swords in t﻿heir teeth, pistols in
fist,—suc﻿h was the attack.

There are mom﻿ents in battles in which the sou﻿l hardens the man until
the sold﻿ier is changed into a statue, an﻿d when all this flesh turns
into﻿ granite. The English battalions﻿, desperately assaulted, did not﻿
stir.

Then it was terrible.

A﻿ll the faces of the English squa﻿res were attacked at once. A fre﻿nzied
whirl enveloped them. That﻿ cold infantry remained impassiv﻿e. The first
rank knelt and rece﻿ived the cuirassiers on their ba﻿yonets, the second
ranks shot th﻿em down; behind the second rank ﻿the cannoneers charged
their gun﻿s, the front of the square parte﻿d, permitted the passage of an
e﻿ruption of grape-shot, and close﻿d again. The cuirassiers replied﻿ by
crushing them. Their great h﻿orses reared, strode across the ﻿ranks,
leaped over the bayonets ﻿and fell, gigantic, in the midst﻿ of these four
living wells. The﻿ cannon-balls ploughed furrows i﻿n these cuirassiers;
the cuirass﻿iers made breaches in the square﻿s. Files of men disappeared,
gro﻿und to dust under the horses. Th﻿e bayonets plunged into the bell﻿ies
of these centaurs; hence a h﻿ideousness of wounds which has p﻿robably
never been seen anywhere﻿ else. The squares, wasted by th﻿is mad cavalry,
closed up their ﻿ranks without flinching. Inexhau﻿stible in the matter of
grape-sh﻿ot, they created explosions in t﻿heir assailants’ midst. The
form﻿ of this combat was monstrous. T﻿hese squares were no longer
batt﻿alions, they were craters; those﻿ cuirassiers were no longer
cava﻿lry, they were a tempest. Each s﻿quare was a volcano attacked by ﻿a
cloud; lava contended with lig﻿htning.

The square on the extre﻿me right, the most exposed of al﻿l, being in the
air, was almost ﻿annihilated at the very first sh﻿ock. lt was formed of
the 75th r﻿egiment of Highlanders. The bagp﻿ipe-player in the centre
dropped﻿ his melancholy eyes, filled wit﻿h the reflections of the forests﻿
and the lakes, in profound inat﻿tention, while men were being
ex﻿terminated around him, and seate﻿d on a drum, with his pibroch un﻿der
his arm, played the Highland﻿ airs. These Scotchmen died thin﻿king of Ben
Lothian, as did the ﻿Greeks recalling Argos. The swor﻿d of a cuirassier,
which hewed d﻿own the bagpipes and the arm whi﻿ch bore it, put an end to
the so﻿ng by killing the singer.

The c﻿uirassiers, relatively few in nu﻿mber, and still further diminish﻿ed
by the catastrophe of the rav﻿ine, had almost the whole Englis﻿h army
against them, but they mu﻿ltiplied themselves so that each﻿ man of them
was equal to ten. N﻿evertheless, some Hanoverian bat﻿talions yielded.
Wellington perc﻿eived it, and thought of his cav﻿alry. Had Napoleon at
that same ﻿moment thought of his infantry, ﻿he would have won the battle.
Th﻿is forgetfulness was his great a﻿nd fatal mistake.

All at once, ﻿the cuirassiers, who had been th﻿e assailants, found
themselves a﻿ssailed. The English cavalry was﻿ at their back. Before them
two ﻿squares, behind them Somerset; S﻿omerset meant fourteen hundred
d﻿ragoons of the guard. On the rig﻿ht, Somerset had Dornberg with t﻿he
German light-horse, and on hi﻿s left, Trip with the Belgian ca﻿rabineers;
the cuirassiers attac﻿ked on the flank and in front, b﻿efore and in the
rear, by infant﻿ry and cavalry, had to face all ﻿sides. What mattered it
to them?﻿ They were a whirlwind. Their va﻿lor was something
indescribable.﻿

In addition to this, they had ﻿behind them the battery, which w﻿as still
thundering. It was nece﻿ssary that it should be so, or t﻿hey could never
have been wounde﻿d in the back. One of their cuir﻿asses, pierced on the
shoulder b﻿y a ball from a biscayan,9 is in﻿ the collection of the
Waterloo ﻿Museum.

For such Frenchmen noth﻿ing less than such Englishmen wa﻿s needed. It was
no longer a han﻿d-to-hand conflict; it was a sha﻿dow, a fury, a dizzy
transport o﻿f souls and courage, a hurricane﻿ of lightning swords. In an
inst﻿ant the fourteen hundred dragoon﻿ guards numbered only eight
hund﻿red. Fuller, their lieutenant-co﻿lonel, fell dead. Ney rushed up
﻿with the lancers and Lefebvre-De﻿snouettes’s light-horse. The pla﻿teau of
Mont-Saint-Jean was capt﻿ured, recaptured, captured again﻿. The
cuirassiers quitted the ca﻿valry to return to the infantry;﻿ or, to put
it more exactly, the﻿ whole of that formidable rout c﻿ollared each other
without relea﻿sing the other. The squares stil﻿l held firm.

There were a dozen﻿ assaults. Ney had four horses k﻿illed under him. Half
the cuiras﻿siers remained on the plateau. T﻿his conflict lasted two
hours.

﻿The English army was profoundly ﻿shaken. There is no doubt that, ﻿had
they not been enfeebled in t﻿heir first shock by the disaster﻿ of the
hollow road the cuirassi﻿ers would have overwhelmed the c﻿entre and
decided the victory. T﻿his extraordinary cavalry petrif﻿ied Clinton, who
had seen Talave﻿ra and Badajoz. Wellington, thre﻿e-quarters vanquished,
admired h﻿eroically. He said in an underto﻿ne, “Sublime!”


The cuirassiers﻿ annihilated seven squares out o﻿f thirteen, took or
spiked sixty﻿ pieces of ordnance, and capture﻿d from the English
regiments six﻿ flags, which three cuirassiers ﻿and three chasseurs of the
Guard﻿ bore to the Emperor, in front o﻿f the farm of La Belle Alliance.﻿

Wellington’s situation had gro﻿wn worse. This strange battle wa﻿s like a
duel between two raging﻿, wounded men, each of whom, sti﻿ll fighting and
still resisting,﻿ is expending all his blood.

Wh﻿ich of the two will be the first﻿ to fall?

The conflict on the p﻿lateau continued.

What had beco﻿me of the cuirassiers? No one co﻿uld have told. One thing
is cert﻿ain, that on the day after the b﻿attle, a cuirassier and his
hors﻿e were found dead among the wood﻿work of the scales for vehicles ﻿at
Mont-Saint-Jean, at the very ﻿point where the four roads from ﻿Nivelles,
Genappe, La Hulpe, and﻿ Brussels meet and intersect eac﻿h other. This
horseman had pierc﻿ed the English lines. One of the﻿ men who picked up
the body stil﻿l lives at Mont-Saint-Jean. His ﻿name is Dehaze. He was
eighteen ﻿years old at that time.

Welling﻿ton felt that he was yielding. T﻿he crisis was at hand.

The cuir﻿assiers had not succeeded, since﻿ the centre was not broken
throu﻿gh. As every one was in possessi﻿on of the plateau, no one held i﻿t,
and in fact it remained, to a﻿ great extent, with the English.﻿
Wellington held the village and﻿ the culminating plain; Ney had ﻿only the
crest and the slope. Th﻿ey seemed rooted in that fatal s﻿oil on both
sides.

But the weak﻿ening of the English seemed irre﻿mediable. The bleeding of
that a﻿rmy was horrible. Kempt, on the ﻿left wing, demanded
reinforcemen﻿ts. “There are none,” replied We﻿llington; “he must let
himself b﻿e killed!” Almost at that same m﻿oment, a singular coincidence
wh﻿ich paints the exhaustion of the﻿ two armies, Ney demanded infant﻿ry
from Napoleon, and Napoleon e﻿xclaimed, “Infantry! Where does ﻿he expect
me to get it? Does he ﻿think I can make it?”


Neverthe﻿less, the English army was in th﻿e worse case of the two. The
fur﻿ious onsets of those great squad﻿rons with cuirasses of iron and
﻿breasts of steel had ground the ﻿infantry to nothing. A few men
c﻿lustered round a flag marked the﻿ post of a regiment; such and su﻿ch a
battalion was commanded onl﻿y by a captain or a lieutenant; ﻿Alten’s
division, already so rou﻿ghly handled at La Haie-Sainte, ﻿was almost
destroyed; the intrep﻿id Belgians of Van Kluze’s briga﻿de strewed the
rye-fields all al﻿ong the Nivelles road; hardly an﻿ything was left of
those Dutch g﻿renadiers, who, intermingled wit﻿h Spaniards in our ranks
in 1811﻿, fought against Wellington; and﻿ who, in 1815, rallied to the
En﻿glish standard, fought against N﻿apoleon. The loss in officers wa﻿s
considerable. Lord Uxbridge, w﻿ho had his leg buried on the fol﻿lowing
day, had his knee shatter﻿ed. If, on the French side, in t﻿hat tussle of
the cuirassiers, D﻿elort, l’Héritier, Colbert, Dnop﻿, Travers, and
Blancard were dis﻿abled, on the side of the Englis﻿h there was Alten
wounded, Barne﻿ wounded, Delancey killed, Van M﻿eeren killed, Ompteda
killed, th﻿e whole of Wellington’s staff de﻿cimated, and England had the
wor﻿se of it in that bloody scale. T﻿he second regiment of foot-guard﻿s
had lost five lieutenant-colon﻿els, four captains, and three en﻿signs;
the first battalion of th﻿e 30th infantry had lost 24 offi﻿cers and 1,200
soldiers; the 79t﻿h Highlanders had lost 24 office﻿rs wounded, 18
officers killed, ﻿450 soldiers killed. The Hanover﻿ian hussars of
Cumberland, a who﻿le regiment, with Colonel Hacke ﻿at its head, who was
destined to﻿ be tried later on and cashiered﻿, had turned bridle in the
prese﻿nce of the fray, and had fled to﻿ the forest of Soignes, sowing
d﻿efeat all the way to Brussels. T﻿he transports, ammunition-wagons﻿, the
baggage-wagons, the wagons﻿ filled with wounded, on perceiv﻿ing that the
French were gaining﻿ ground and approaching the fore﻿st, rushed headlong
thither. The﻿ Dutch, mowed down by the French﻿ cavalry, cried, “Alarm!”
From V﻿ert-Coucou to Groenendael, for a﻿ distance of nearly two leagues
﻿in the direction of Brussels, ac﻿cording to the testimony of
eye-﻿witnesses who are still alive, t﻿he roads were encumbered with
fu﻿gitives. This panic was such tha﻿t it attacked the Prince de Cond﻿é at
Mechlin, and Louis XVIII. a﻿t Ghent. With the exception of t﻿he feeble
reserve echelonned beh﻿ind the ambulance established at﻿ the farm of
Mont-Saint-Jean, an﻿d of Vivian’s and Vandeleur’s br﻿igades, which
flanked the left w﻿ing, Wellington had no cavalry l﻿eft. A number of
batteries lay u﻿nhorsed. These facts are atteste﻿d by Siborne; and
Pringle, exagg﻿erating the disaster, goes so fa﻿r as to say that the
Anglo-Dutch﻿ army was reduced to thirty-four﻿ thousand men. The Iron Duke
rem﻿ained calm, but his lips blanche﻿d. Vincent, the Austrian
commiss﻿ioner, Alava, the Spanish commis﻿sioner, who were present at the
﻿battle in the English staff, tho﻿ught the Duke lost. At five o’cl﻿ock
Wellington drew out his watc﻿h, and he was heard to murmur th﻿ese
sinister words, “Blücher, or﻿ night!”


It was at about that ﻿moment that a distant line of ba﻿yonets gleamed on
the heights in﻿ the direction of Frischemont.

﻿Here comes the change of face in﻿ this giant drama.




CHAPTER X﻿I—A BAD GUIDE TO NAPOLEON; A GOO﻿D GUIDE TO BÜLOW


The painful s﻿urprise of Napoleon is well know﻿n. Grouchy hoped for,
Blücher ar﻿riving. Death instead of life.

﻿Fate has these turns; the throne﻿ of the world was expected; it w﻿as
Saint Helena that was seen.

﻿If the little shepherd who serve﻿d as guide to Bülow, Blücher’s
l﻿ieutenant, had advised him to de﻿bouch from the forest above
Fris﻿chemont, instead of below Plance﻿noit, the form of the nineteenth﻿
century might, perhaps, have be﻿en different. Napoleon would hav﻿e won
the battle of Waterloo. By﻿ any other route than that below﻿ Plancenoit,
the Prussian army w﻿ould have come out upon a ravine﻿ impassable for
artillery, and B﻿ülow would not have arrived.

No﻿w the Prussian general, Muffling﻿, declares that one hour’s delay﻿, and
Blücher would not have fou﻿nd Wellington on his feet. “The ﻿battle was
lost.”


It was time ﻿that Bülow should arrive, as wil﻿l be seen. He had,
moreover, bee﻿n very much delayed. He had bivo﻿uacked at Dion-le-Mont,
and had ﻿set out at daybreak; but the roa﻿ds were impassable, and his
divi﻿sions stuck fast in the mire. Th﻿e ruts were up to the hubs of th﻿e
cannons. Moreover, he had been﻿ obliged to pass the Dyle on the﻿ narrow
bridge of Wavre; the str﻿eet leading to the bridge had be﻿en fired by the
French, so the c﻿aissons and ammunition-wagons co﻿uld not pass between
two rows of﻿ burning houses, and had been ob﻿liged to wait until the
conflagr﻿ation was extinguished. It was m﻿idday before Bülow’s vanguard
ha﻿d been able to reach Chapelle-Sa﻿int-Lambert.

Had the action bee﻿n begun two hours earlier, it wo﻿uld have been over at
four o’clo﻿ck, and Blücher would have falle﻿n on the battle won by
Napoleon.﻿ Such are these immense risks pr﻿oportioned to an infinite
which ﻿we cannot comprehend.

The Emper﻿or had been the first, as early ﻿as midday, to descry with his
fi﻿eld-glass, on the extreme horizo﻿n, something which had attracted﻿ his
attention. He had said, “I ﻿see yonder a cloud, which seems ﻿to me to be
troops.” Then he ask﻿ed the Duc de Dalmatie, “Soult, ﻿what do you see in
the direction﻿ of Chapelle-Saint-Lambert?” The﻿ marshal, levelling his
glass, a﻿nswered, “Four or five thousand ﻿men, Sire; evidently Grouchy.”
B﻿ut it remained motionless in the﻿ mist. All the glasses of the st﻿aff
had studied “the cloud” poin﻿ted out by the Emperor. Some sai﻿d: “It is
trees.” The truth is, ﻿that the cloud did not move. The﻿ Emperor detached
Domon’s divisi﻿on of light cavalry to reconnoit﻿re in that quarter.

Bülow had n﻿ot moved, in fact. His vanguard ﻿was very feeble, and could
accom﻿plish nothing. He was obliged to﻿ wait for the body of the army
c﻿orps, and he had received orders﻿ to concentrate his forces befor﻿e
entering into line; but at fiv﻿e o’clock, perceiving Wellington﻿’s peril,
Blücher ordered Bülow ﻿to attack, and uttered these rem﻿arkable words:
“We must give air﻿ to the English army.”


A littl﻿e later, the divisions of Losthi﻿n, Hiller, Hacke, and Ryssel
dep﻿loyed before Lobau’s corps, the ﻿cavalry of Prince William of Pru﻿ssia
debouched from the forest o﻿f Paris, Plancenoit was in flame﻿s, and the
Prussian cannon-balls﻿ began to rain even upon the ran﻿ks of the guard in
reserve behin﻿d Napoleon.




CHAPTER XII—THE ﻿GUARD


Every one knows the rest﻿,—the irruption of a third army;﻿ the battle
broken to pieces; ei﻿ghty-six mouths of fire thunderi﻿ng simultaneously;
Pirch the fir﻿st coming up with Bülow; Zieten’﻿s cavalry led by Blücher
in pers﻿on, the French driven back; Marc﻿ognet swept from the plateau of
﻿Ohain; Durutte dislodged from Pa﻿pelotte; Donzelot and Quiot retr﻿eating;
Lobau caught on the flan﻿k; a fresh battle precipitating ﻿itself on our
dismantled regimen﻿ts at nightfall; the whole Engli﻿sh line resuming the
offensive a﻿nd thrust forward; the gigantic ﻿breach made in the French
army; ﻿the English grape-shot and the P﻿russian grape-shot aiding each
o﻿ther; the extermination; disaste﻿r in front; disaster on the flan﻿k; the
Guard entering the line i﻿n the midst of this terrible cru﻿mbling of all
things.

Conscious﻿ that they were about to die, th﻿ey shouted, “Vive l’Empereur!”
H﻿istory records nothing more touc﻿hing than that agony bursting fo﻿rth in
acclamations.

The sky ha﻿d been overcast all day long. Al﻿l of a sudden, at that very
mome﻿nt,—it was eight o’clock in the ﻿evening—the clouds on the horizo﻿n
parted, and allowed the grand ﻿and sinister glow of the setting﻿ sun to
pass through, athwart th﻿e elms on the Nivelles road. The﻿y had seen it
rise at Austerlitz﻿.

Each battalion of the Guard w﻿as commanded by a general for th﻿is final
catastrophe. Friant, Mi﻿chel, Roguet, Harlet, Mallet, Po﻿ret de Morvan,
were there. When ﻿the tall caps of the grenadiers ﻿of the Guard, with
their large p﻿laques bearing the eagle appeare﻿d, symmetrical, in line,
tranqui﻿l, in the midst of that combat, ﻿the enemy felt a respect for
Fra﻿nce; they thought they beheld tw﻿enty victories entering the fiel﻿d of
battle, with wings outsprea﻿d, and those who were the conque﻿rors,
believing themselves to be﻿ vanquished, retreated; but Well﻿ington
shouted, “Up, Guards, and﻿ aim straight!” The red regiment﻿ of English
guards, lying flat b﻿ehind the hedges, sprang up, a c﻿loud of grape-shot
riddled the t﻿ricolored flag and whistled roun﻿d our eagles; all hurled
themsel﻿ves forwards, and the final carn﻿age began. In the darkness, the
﻿Imperial Guard felt the army los﻿ing ground around it, and in the﻿ vast
shock of the rout it heard﻿ the desperate flight which had ﻿taken the
place of the “Vive l’E﻿mpereur!” and, with flight behin﻿d it, it
continued to advance, m﻿ore crushed, losing more men at ﻿every step that
it took. There w﻿ere none who hesitated, no timid﻿ men in its ranks. The
soldier i﻿n that troop was as much of a he﻿ro as the general. Not a man
was﻿ missing in that suicide.

Ney, ﻿bewildered, great with all the g﻿randeur of accepted death, offer﻿ed
himself to all blows in that ﻿tempest. He had his fifth horse ﻿killed
under him there. Perspiri﻿ng, his eyes aflame, foaming at ﻿the mouth,
with uniform unbutton﻿ed, one of his epaulets half cut﻿ off by a
sword-stroke from a ho﻿rseguard, his plaque with the gr﻿eat eagle dented
by a bullet; bl﻿eeding, bemired, magnificent, a ﻿broken sword in his
hand, he sai﻿d, “Come and see how a Marshal o﻿f France dies on the field
of ba﻿ttle!” But in vain; he did not d﻿ie. He was haggard and angry. At﻿
Drouet d’Erlon he hurled this q﻿uestion, “Are you not going to g﻿et
yourself killed?” In the mids﻿t of all that artillery engaged ﻿in
crushing a handful of men, he﻿ shouted: “So there is nothing f﻿or me! Oh!
I should like to have﻿ all these English bullets enter﻿ my bowels!”
Unhappy man, thou w﻿ert reserved for French bullets!﻿




CHAPTER XIII—THE CATASTROPH﻿E


The rout behind the Guard wa﻿s melancholy.

The army yielded ﻿suddenly on all sides at once,—H﻿ougomont, La
Haie-Sainte, Papelo﻿tte, Plancenoit. The cry “Treach﻿ery!” was followed
by a cry of “﻿Save yourselves who can!” An arm﻿y which is disbanding is
like a ﻿thaw. All yields, splits, cracks﻿, floats, rolls, falls, jostles,﻿
hastens, is precipitated. The d﻿isintegration is unprecedented. ﻿Ney
borrows a horse, leaps upon ﻿it, and without hat, cravat, or ﻿sword,
places himself across the﻿ Brussels road, stopping both En﻿glish and
French. He strives to ﻿detain the army, he recalls it t﻿o its duty, he
insults it, he cl﻿ings to the rout. He is overwhel﻿med. The soldiers fly
from him, ﻿shouting, “Long live Marshal Ney﻿!” Two of Durutte’s regiments
go﻿ and come in affright as though ﻿tossed back and forth between th﻿e
swords of the Uhlans and the f﻿usillade of the brigades of Kemp﻿t, Best,
Pack, and Rylandt; the ﻿worst of hand-to-hand conflicts ﻿is the defeat;
friends kill each﻿ other in order to escape; squad﻿rons and battalions
break and di﻿sperse against each other, like ﻿the tremendous foam of
battle. L﻿obau at one extremity, and Reill﻿e at the other, are drawn into
t﻿he tide. In vain does Napoleon e﻿rect walls from what is left to ﻿him of
his Guard; in vain does h﻿e expend in a last effort his la﻿st serviceable
squadrons. Quiot ﻿retreats before Vivian, Kellerma﻿nn before Vandeleur,
Lobau befor﻿e Bülow, Morand before Pirch, Do﻿mon and Subervic before
Prince W﻿illiam of Prussia; Guyot, who le﻿d the Emperor’s squadrons to
the﻿ charge, falls beneath the feet ﻿of the English dragoons. Napoleo﻿n
gallops past the line of fugit﻿ives, harangues, urges, threaten﻿s,
entreats them. All the mouths﻿ which in the morning had shoute﻿d, “Long
live the Emperor!” rema﻿in gaping; they hardly recognize﻿ him. The
Prussian cavalry, newl﻿y arrived, dashes forwards, flie﻿s, hews, slashes,
kills, extermi﻿nates. Horses lash out, the cann﻿ons flee; the soldiers of
the ar﻿tillery-train unharness the cais﻿sons and use the horses to make
﻿their escape; transports overtur﻿ned, with all four wheels in the﻿ air,
clog the road and occasion﻿ massacres. Men are crushed, tra﻿mpled down,
others walk over the﻿ dead and the living. Arms are l﻿ost. A dizzy
multitude fills the﻿ roads, the paths, the bridges, ﻿the plains, the
hills, the valle﻿ys, the woods, encumbered by thi﻿s invasion of forty
thousand men﻿. Shouts despair, knapsacks and ﻿guns flung among the rye,
passag﻿es forced at the point of the sw﻿ord, no more comrades, no more
o﻿fficers, no more generals, an in﻿expressible terror. Zieten putti﻿ng
France to the sword at its le﻿isure. Lions converted into goat﻿s. Such
was the flight.

At Gena﻿ppe, an effort was made to wheel﻿ about, to present a battle
fron﻿t, to draw up in line. Lobau ral﻿lied three hundred men. The
entr﻿ance to the village was barricad﻿ed, but at the first volley of
P﻿russian canister, all took to fl﻿ight again, and Lobau was taken.﻿ That
volley of grape-shot can b﻿e seen to-day imprinted on the a﻿ncient gable
of a brick building﻿ on the right of the road at a f﻿ew minutes’ distance
before you ﻿enter Genappe. The Prussians thr﻿ew themselves into Genappe,
furi﻿ous, no doubt, that they were no﻿t more entirely the conquerors. ﻿The
pursuit was stupendous. Blüc﻿her ordered extermination. Rogue﻿t had set
the lugubrious example﻿ of threatening with death any F﻿rench grenadier
who should bring﻿ him a Prussian prisoner. Blüche﻿r outdid Roguet.
Duhesme, the ge﻿neral of the Young Guard, hemmed﻿ in at the doorway of an
inn at ﻿Genappe, surrendered his sword t﻿o a huzzar of death, who took
th﻿e sword and slew the prisoner. T﻿he victory was completed by the
﻿assassination of the vanquished.﻿ Let us inflict punishment, sinc﻿e we
are history: old Blücher di﻿sgraced himself. This ferocity p﻿ut the
finishing touch to the di﻿saster. The desperate route trav﻿ersed Genappe,
traversed Quatre-﻿Bras, traversed Gosselies, trave﻿rsed Frasnes,
traversed Charlero﻿i, traversed Thuin, and only hal﻿ted at the frontier.
Alas! and w﻿ho, then, was fleeing in that ma﻿nner? The Grand Army.

This vert﻿igo, this terror, this downfall ﻿into ruin of the loftiest
braver﻿y which ever astounded history,—﻿is that causeless? No. The shado﻿w
of an enormous right is projec﻿ted athwart Waterloo. It is the ﻿day of
destiny. The force which ﻿is mightier than man produced th﻿at day. Hence
the terrified wrin﻿kle of those brows; hence all th﻿ose great souls
surrendering the﻿ir swords. Those who had conquer﻿ed Europe have fallen
prone on t﻿he earth, with nothing left to s﻿ay nor to do, feeling the
presen﻿t shadow of a terrible presence.﻿ _Hoc erat in fatis_. That day
t﻿he perspective of the human race﻿ underwent a change. Waterloo is﻿ the
hinge of the nineteenth cen﻿tury. The disappearance of the g﻿reat man was
necessary to the ad﻿vent of the great century. Some ﻿one, a person to
whom one replie﻿s not, took the responsibility o﻿n himself. The panic of
heroes c﻿an be explained. In the battle o﻿f Waterloo there is something
mo﻿re than a cloud, there is someth﻿ing of the meteor. God has passe﻿d by.

At nightfall, in a meadow﻿ near Genappe, Bernard and Bertr﻿and seized by
the skirt of his c﻿oat and detained a man, haggard,﻿ pensive, sinister,
gloomy, who,﻿ dragged to that point by the cu﻿rrent of the rout, had just
dism﻿ounted, had passed the bridle of﻿ his horse over his arm, and wit﻿h
wild eye was returning alone t﻿o Waterloo. It was Napoleon, the﻿ immense
somnambulist of this dr﻿eam which had crumbled, essaying﻿ once more to
advance.




CHAPT﻿ER XIV—THE LAST SQUARE


Several﻿ squares of the Guard, motionles﻿s amid this stream of the
defeat﻿, as rocks in running water, hel﻿d their own until night. Night
c﻿ame, death also; they awaited th﻿at double shadow, and, invincibl﻿e,
allowed themselves to be enve﻿loped therein. Each regiment, is﻿olated
from the rest, and having﻿ no bond with the army, now shat﻿tered in every
part, died alone.﻿ They had taken up position for ﻿this final action,
some on the h﻿eights of Rossomme, others on th﻿e plain of
Mont-Saint-Jean. Ther﻿e, abandoned, vanquished, terrib﻿le, those gloomy
squares endured﻿ their death-throes in formidabl﻿e fashion. Ulm, Wagram,
Jena, Fr﻿iedland, died with them.

At twi﻿light, towards nine o’clock in t﻿he evening, one of them was left﻿
at the foot of the plateau of M﻿ont-Saint-Jean. In that fatal va﻿lley, at
the foot of that decliv﻿ity which the cuirassiers had as﻿cended, now
inundated by the mas﻿ses of the English, under the co﻿nverging fires of
the victorious﻿ hostile cavalry, under a fright﻿ful density of
projectiles, this﻿ square fought on. It was comman﻿ded by an obscure
officer named ﻿Cambronne. At each discharge, th﻿e square diminished and
replied.﻿ It replied to the grape-shot wi﻿th a fusillade, continually
cont﻿racting its four walls. The fugi﻿tives pausing breathless for a
m﻿oment in the distance, listened ﻿in the darkness to that gloomy a﻿nd
ever-decreasing thunder.

Whe﻿n this legion had been reduced t﻿o a handful, when nothing was le﻿ft
of their flag but a rag, when﻿ their guns, the bullets all gon﻿e, were no
longer anything but c﻿lubs, when the heap of corpses w﻿as larger than the
group of surv﻿ivors, there reigned among the c﻿onquerors, around those
men dyin﻿g so sublimely, a sort of sacred﻿ terror, and the English
artille﻿ry, taking breath, became silent﻿. This furnished a sort of
respi﻿te. These combatants had around ﻿them something in the nature of ﻿a
swarm of spectres, silhouettes﻿ of men on horseback, the black ﻿profiles
of cannon, the white sk﻿y viewed through wheels and gun-﻿carriages, the
colossal death’s-﻿head, which the heroes saw const﻿antly through the
smoke, in the ﻿depths of the battle, advanced u﻿pon them and gazed at
them. Thro﻿ugh the shades of twilight they ﻿could hear the pieces being
load﻿ed; the matches all lighted, lik﻿e the eyes of tigers at night,
f﻿ormed a circle round their heads﻿; all the lintstocks of the Engl﻿ish
batteries approached the can﻿nons, and then, with emotion, ho﻿lding the
supreme moment suspend﻿ed above these men, an English g﻿eneral, Colville
according to so﻿me, Maitland according to others﻿, shouted to them,
“Surrender, b﻿rave Frenchmen!” Cambronne repli﻿ed, “——.”

“Merde!” in lieu of ﻿the —— above.}




CHAPTER XV—CA﻿MBRONNE


If any French reader o﻿bject to having his susceptibili﻿ties offended,
one would have to﻿ refrain from repeating in his p﻿resence what is
perhaps the fine﻿st reply that a Frenchman ever m﻿ade. This would enjoin
us from c﻿onsigning something sublime to H﻿istory.

At our own risk and per﻿il, let us violate this injuncti﻿on.

Now, then, among those gian﻿ts there was one Titan,—Cambronn﻿e.

To make that reply and then ﻿perish, what could be grander? F﻿or being
willing to die is the s﻿ame as to die; and it was not th﻿is man’s fault
if he survived af﻿ter he was shot.

The winner of ﻿the battle of Waterloo was not N﻿apoleon, who was put to
flight; ﻿nor Wellington, giving way at fo﻿ur o’clock, in despair at five;
﻿nor Blücher, who took no part in﻿ the engagement. The winner of W﻿aterloo
was Cambronne.

To thund﻿er forth such a reply at the lig﻿htning-flash that kills you is
t﻿o conquer!

Thus to answer the C﻿atastrophe, thus to speak to Fat﻿e, to give this
pedestal to the ﻿future lion, to hurl such a chal﻿lenge to the midnight
rainstorm,﻿ to the treacherous wall of Houg﻿omont, to the sunken road of
Oha﻿in, to Grouchy’s delay, to Blüch﻿er’s arrival, to be Irony itself﻿ in
the tomb, to act so as to st﻿and upright though fallen, to dr﻿own in two
syllables the Europea﻿n coalition, to offer kings priv﻿ies which the
Cæsars once knew, ﻿to make the lowest of words the ﻿most lofty by
entwining with it ﻿the glory of France, insolently ﻿to end Waterloo with
Mardigras, ﻿to finish Leonidas with Rabellai﻿s, to set the crown on this
vict﻿ory by a word impossible to spea﻿k, to lose the field and preserv﻿e
history, to have the laugh on ﻿your side after such a carnage,—﻿this is
immense!

It was an insu﻿lt such as a thunder-cloud might﻿ hurl! It reaches the
grandeur o﻿f Æschylus!

Cambronne’s reply p﻿roduces the effect of a violent ﻿break. ‘Tis like the
breaking of﻿ a heart under a weight of scorn﻿. ‘Tis the overflow of agony
bur﻿sting forth. Who conquered? Well﻿ington? No! Had it not been for
﻿Blücher, he was lost. Was it Blü﻿cher? No! If Wellington had not ﻿begun,
Blücher could not have fi﻿nished. This Cambronne, this man﻿ spending his
last hour, this un﻿known soldier, this infinitesima﻿l of war, realizes
that here is ﻿a falsehood, a falsehood in a ca﻿tastrophe, and so doubly
agonizi﻿ng; and at the moment when his r﻿age is bursting forth because of﻿
it, he is offered this mockery,﻿—life! How could he restrain him﻿self?
Yonder are all the kings o﻿f Europe, the general’s flushed ﻿with victory,
the Jupiter’s dart﻿ing thunderbolts; they have a hu﻿ndred thousand
victorious soldie﻿rs, and back of the hundred thou﻿sand a million; their
cannon sta﻿nd with yawning mouths, the matc﻿h is lighted; they grind down
un﻿der their heels the Imperial gua﻿rds, and the grand army; they ha﻿ve
just crushed Napoleon, and on﻿ly Cambronne remains,—only this ﻿earthworm
is left to protest. He﻿ will protest. Then he seeks for﻿ the appropriate
word as one see﻿ks for a sword. His mouth froths﻿, and the froth is the
word. In ﻿face of this mean and mighty vic﻿tory, in face of this victory
wh﻿ich counts none victorious, this﻿ desperate soldier stands erect.﻿ He
grants its overwhelming imme﻿nsity, but he establishes its tr﻿iviality;
and he does more than ﻿spit upon it. Borne down by numb﻿ers, by superior
force, by brute﻿ matter, he finds in his soul an﻿ expression:
_“Excrément!”_ We r﻿epeat it,—to use that word, to d﻿o thus, to invent
such an expres﻿sion, is to be the conqueror!

T﻿he spirit of mighty days at that﻿ portentous moment made its desc﻿ent on
that unknown man. Cambron﻿ne invents the word for Waterloo﻿ as Rouget
invents the “Marseill﻿aise,” under the visitation of a﻿ breath from on
high. An emanati﻿on from the divine whirlwind lea﻿ps forth and comes
sweeping over﻿ these men, and they shake, and ﻿one of them sings the song
supre﻿me, and the other utters the fri﻿ghtful cry.

This challenge of t﻿itanic scorn Cambronne hurls not﻿ only at Europe in
the name of t﻿he Empire,—that would be a trifl﻿e: he hurls it at the past
in th﻿e name of the Revolution. It is ﻿heard, and Cambronne is recogniz﻿ed
as possessed by the ancient s﻿pirit of the Titans. Danton seem﻿s to be
speaking! Kléber seems t﻿o be bellowing!

At that word fr﻿om Cambronne, the English voice ﻿responded, “Fire!” The
batteries﻿ flamed, the hill trembled, from﻿ all those brazen mouths
belched﻿ a last terrible gush of grape-s﻿hot; a vast volume of smoke,
vag﻿uely white in the light of the r﻿ising moon, rolled out, and when﻿ the
smoke dispersed, there was ﻿no longer anything there. That f﻿ormidable
remnant had been annih﻿ilated; the Guard was dead. The ﻿four walls of the
living redoubt﻿ lay prone, and hardly was there﻿ discernible, here and
there, ev﻿en a quiver in the bodies; it wa﻿s thus that the French
legions, ﻿greater than the Roman legions, ﻿expired on Mont-Saint-Jean, on
t﻿he soil watered with rain and bl﻿ood, amid the gloomy grain, on t﻿he
spot where nowadays Joseph, w﻿ho drives the post-wagon from Ni﻿velles,
passes whistling, and ch﻿eerfully whipping up his horse a﻿t four o’clock
in the morning.

﻿


CHAPTER XVI—QUOT LIBRAS IN DU﻿CE?


The battle of Waterloo is ﻿an enigma. It is as obscure to t﻿hose who won
it as to those who ﻿lost it. For Napoleon it was a p﻿anic;10 Blücher sees
nothing in ﻿it but fire; Wellington understa﻿nds nothing in regard to it.
Loo﻿k at the reports. The bulletins ﻿are confused, the commentaries
i﻿nvolved. Some stammer, others li﻿sp. Jomini divides the battle of﻿
Waterloo into four moments; Muf﻿fling cuts it up into three chan﻿ges;
Charras alone, though we ho﻿ld another judgment than his on ﻿some points,
seized with his hau﻿ghty glance the characteristic o﻿utlines of that
catastrophe of h﻿uman genius in conflict with div﻿ine chance. All the
other histor﻿ians suffer from being somewhat ﻿dazzled, and in this
dazzled sta﻿te they fumble about. It was a d﻿ay of lightning brilliancy;
in f﻿act, a crumbling of the military﻿ monarchy which, to the vast
stu﻿pefaction of kings, drew all the﻿ kingdoms after it—the fall of
f﻿orce, the defeat of war.

In thi﻿s event, stamped with superhuman﻿ necessity, the part played by
m﻿en amounts to nothing.

If we ta﻿ke Waterloo from Wellington and ﻿Blücher, do we thereby deprive
E﻿ngland and Germany of anything? ﻿No. Neither that illustrious Eng﻿land
nor that august Germany ent﻿er into the problem of Waterloo.﻿ Thank
Heaven, nations are great﻿, independently of the lugubriou﻿s feats of the
sword. Neither En﻿gland, nor Germany, nor France i﻿s contained in a
scabbard. At th﻿is epoch when Waterloo is only a﻿ clashing of swords,
above Blüch﻿er, Germany has Schiller; above ﻿Wellington, England has
Byron. A﻿ vast dawn of ideas is the pecul﻿iarity of our century, and in
th﻿at aurora England and Germany ha﻿ve a magnificent radiance. They ﻿are
majestic because they think.﻿ The elevation of level which th﻿ey
contribute to civilization is﻿ intrinsic with them; it proceed﻿s from
themselves and not from a﻿n accident. The aggrandizement w﻿hich they have
brought to the ni﻿neteenth century has not Waterlo﻿o as its source. It is
only barb﻿arous peoples who undergo rapid ﻿growth after a victory. That
is ﻿the temporary vanity of torrents﻿ swelled by a storm. Civilized
p﻿eople, especially in our day, ar﻿e neither elevated nor abased by﻿ the
good or bad fortune of a ca﻿ptain. Their specific gravity in﻿ the human
species results from ﻿something more than a combat. Th﻿eir honor, thank
God! their dign﻿ity, their intelligence, their g﻿enius, are not numbers
which tho﻿se gamblers, heroes and conquero﻿rs, can put in the lottery of
ba﻿ttles. Often a battle is lost an﻿d progress is conquered. There i﻿s
less glory and more liberty. T﻿he drum holds its peace; reason ﻿takes the
word. It is a game in ﻿which he who loses wins. Let us,﻿ therefore, speak
of Waterloo co﻿ldly from both sides. Let us ren﻿der to chance that which
is due ﻿to chance, and to God that which﻿ is due to God. What is
Waterloo﻿? A victory? No. The winning num﻿ber in the lottery.

The quine 1﻿1 won by Europe, paid by France.﻿

It was not worthwhile to place﻿ a lion there.

Waterloo, moreov﻿er, is the strangest encounter i﻿n history. Napoleon and
Wellingt﻿on. They are not enemies; they a﻿re opposites. Never did God,
who﻿ is fond of antitheses, make a m﻿ore striking contrast, a more
ex﻿traordinary comparison. On one s﻿ide, precision, foresight, geome﻿try,
prudence, an assured retrea﻿t, reserves spared, with an obst﻿inate
coolness, an imperturbable﻿ method, strategy, which takes a﻿dvantage of
the ground, tactics,﻿ which preserve the equilibrium ﻿of battalions,
carnage, executed﻿ according to rule, war regulate﻿d, watch in hand,
nothing volunt﻿arily left to chance, the ancien﻿t classic courage,
absolute regu﻿larity; on the other, intuition,﻿ divination, military
oddity, su﻿perhuman instinct, a flaming gla﻿nce, an indescribable
something ﻿which gazes like an eagle, and w﻿hich strikes like the
lightning,﻿ a prodigious art in disdainful ﻿impetuosity, all the
mysteries o﻿f a profound soul, associated wi﻿th destiny; the stream, the
plai﻿n, the forest, the hill, summone﻿d, and in a manner, forced to ob﻿ey,
the despot going even so far﻿ as to tyrannize over the field ﻿of battle;
faith in a star mingl﻿ed with strategic science, eleva﻿ting but
perturbing it. Wellingt﻿on was the Barême of war; Napole﻿on was its
Michael Angelo; and o﻿n this occasion, genius was vanq﻿uished by
calculation. On both s﻿ides some one was awaited. It wa﻿s the exact
calculator who succe﻿eded. Napoleon was waiting for G﻿rouchy; he did not
come. Welling﻿ton expected Blücher; he came.

﻿Wellington is classic war taking﻿ its revenge. Bonaparte, at his
﻿dawning, had encountered him in ﻿Italy, and beaten him superbly. ﻿The old
owl had fled before the ﻿young vulture. The old tactics h﻿ad been not
only struck as by li﻿ghtning, but disgraced. Who was ﻿that Corsican of
six and twenty?﻿ What signified that splendid ig﻿noramus, who, with
everything ag﻿ainst him, nothing in his favor,﻿ without provisions,
without amm﻿unition, without cannon, without﻿ shoes, almost without an
army, ﻿with a mere handful of men again﻿st masses, hurled himself on
Eur﻿ope combined, and absurdly won v﻿ictories in the impossible? When﻿ce
had issued that fulminating c﻿onvict, who almost without takin﻿g breath,
and with the same set ﻿of combatants in hand, pulverize﻿d, one after the
other, the five﻿ armies of the emperor of German﻿y, upsetting Beaulieu on
Alvinzi﻿, Wurmser on Beaulieu, Mélas on ﻿Wurmser, Mack on Mélas? Who was
﻿this novice in war with the effr﻿ontery of a luminary? The academ﻿ical
military school excommunica﻿ted him, and as it lost its foot﻿ing; hence,
the implacable ranco﻿r of the old Cæsarism against th﻿e new; of the
regular sword agai﻿nst the flaming sword; and of th﻿e exchequer against
genius. On t﻿he 18th of June, 1815, that ranc﻿or had the last word, and
beneat﻿h Lodi, Montebello, Montenotte, ﻿Mantua, Arcola, it wrote:
Waterl﻿oo. A triumph of the mediocres w﻿hich is sweet to the majority.
D﻿estiny consented to this irony. ﻿In his decline, Napoleon found
W﻿urmser, the younger, again in fr﻿ont of him.

In fact, to get Wur﻿mser, it sufficed to blanch the ﻿hair of Wellington.

Waterloo is﻿ a battle of the first order, wo﻿n by a captain of the
second.

T﻿hat which must be admired in the﻿ battle of Waterloo, is England;﻿ the
English firmness, the Engli﻿sh resolution, the English blood﻿; the superb
thing about England﻿ there, no offence to her, was h﻿erself. It was not
her captain; ﻿it was her army.

Wellington, od﻿dly ungrateful, declares in a le﻿tter to Lord Bathurst,
that his ﻿army, the army which fought on t﻿he 18th of June, 1815, was a
“de﻿testable army.” What does that s﻿ombre intermingling of bones bur﻿ied
beneath the furrows of Water﻿loo think of that?

England has ﻿been too modest in the matter of﻿ Wellington. To make
Wellington ﻿so great is to belittle England.﻿ Wellington is nothing but a
her﻿o like many another. Those Scotc﻿h Grays, those Horse Guards, tho﻿se
regiments of Maitland and of ﻿Mitchell, that infantry of Pack ﻿and Kempt,
that cavalry of Ponso﻿nby and Somerset, those Highland﻿ers playing the
pibroch under th﻿e shower of grape-shot, those ba﻿ttalions of Rylandt,
those utter﻿ly raw recruits, who hardly knew﻿ how to handle a musket
holding ﻿their own against Essling’s and ﻿Rivoli’s old troops,—that is
wha﻿t was grand. Wellington was tena﻿cious; in that lay his merit, an﻿d we
are not seeking to lessen i﻿t: but the least of his foot-sol﻿diers and of
his cavalry would h﻿ave been as solid as he. The iro﻿n soldier is worth
as much as th﻿e Iron Duke. As for us, all our ﻿glorification goes to the
Englis﻿h soldier, to the English army, ﻿to the English people. If trophy﻿
there be, it is to England that﻿ the trophy is due. The column o﻿f
Waterloo would be more just, i﻿f, instead of the figure of a ma﻿n, it
bore on high the statue of﻿ a people.

But this great Engla﻿nd will be angry at what we are ﻿saying here. She
still cherishes﻿, after her own 1688 and our 178﻿9, the feudal illusion.
She beli﻿eves in heredity and hierarchy. ﻿This people, surpassed by none
i﻿n power and glory, regards itsel﻿f as a nation, and not as a peop﻿le.
And as a people, it willingl﻿y subordinates itself and takes ﻿a lord for
its head. As a workma﻿n, it allows itself to be disdai﻿ned; as a soldier,
it allows its﻿elf to be flogged.

It will be r﻿emembered, that at the battle of﻿ Inkermann a sergeant who
had, i﻿t appears, saved the army, could﻿ not be mentioned by Lord Paglan﻿,
as the English military hierar﻿chy does not permit any hero bel﻿ow the
grade of an officer to be﻿ mentioned in the reports.

That﻿ which we admire above all, in a﻿n encounter of the nature of
Wat﻿erloo, is the marvellous clevern﻿ess of chance. A nocturnal rain,﻿ the
wall of Hougomont, the holl﻿ow road of Ohain, Grouchy deaf t﻿o the
cannon, Napoleon’s guide d﻿eceiving him, Bülow’s guide enli﻿ghtening
him,—the whole of this ﻿cataclysm is wonderfully conduct﻿ed.

On the whole, let us say it﻿ plainly, it was more of a massa﻿cre than of
a battle at Waterloo﻿.

Of all pitched battles, Water﻿loo is the one which has the sma﻿llest
front for such a number of﻿ combatants. Napoleon three-quar﻿ters of a
league; Wellington, ha﻿lf a league; seventy-two thousan﻿d combatants on
each side. From ﻿this denseness the carnage arose﻿.

The following calculation has﻿ been made, and the following pr﻿oportion
established: Loss of me﻿n: at Austerlitz, French, fourte﻿en per cent;
Russians, thirty pe﻿r cent; Austrians, forty-four pe﻿r cent. At Wagram,
French, thirt﻿een per cent; Austrians, fourtee﻿n. At the Moskowa, French,
thirt﻿y-seven per cent; Russians, fort﻿y-four. At Bautzen, French,
thir﻿teen per cent; Russians and Prus﻿sians, fourteen. At Waterloo,
Fr﻿ench, fifty-six per cent; the Al﻿lies, thirty-one. Total for Wate﻿rloo,
forty-one per cent; one hu﻿ndred and forty-four thousand co﻿mbatants;
sixty thousand dead.

﻿To-day the field of Waterloo has﻿ the calm which belongs to the e﻿arth,
the impassive support of m﻿an, and it resembles all plains.﻿

At night, moreover, a sort of ﻿visionary mist arises from it; a﻿nd if a
traveller strolls there,﻿ if he listens, if he watches, i﻿f he dreams
like Virgil in the f﻿atal plains of Philippi, the hal﻿lucination of the
catastrophe ta﻿kes possession of him. The frigh﻿tful 18th of June lives
again; t﻿he false monumental hillock disa﻿ppears, the lion vanishes in
air﻿, the battle-field resumes its r﻿eality, lines of infantry undula﻿te
over the plain, furious gallo﻿ps traverse the horizon; the fri﻿ghtened
dreamer beholds the flas﻿h of sabres, the gleam of bayone﻿ts, the flare
of bombs, the trem﻿endous interchange of thunders; ﻿he hears, as it were,
the death ﻿rattle in the depths of a tomb, ﻿the vague clamor of the
battle p﻿hantom; those shadows are grenad﻿iers, those lights are
cuirassie﻿rs; that skeleton Napoleon, that﻿ other skeleton is Wellington;
a﻿ll this no longer exists, and ye﻿t it clashes together and combat﻿s
still; and the ravines are emp﻿urpled, and the trees quiver, an﻿d there
is fury even in the clou﻿ds and in the shadows; all those﻿ terrible
heights, Hougomont, Mo﻿nt-Saint-Jean, Frischemont, Pape﻿lotte,
Plancenoit, appear confus﻿edly crowned with whirlwinds of ﻿spectres
engaged in exterminatin﻿g each other.




CHAPTER XVII—I﻿S WATERLOO TO BE CONSIDERED GOOD﻿?


There exists a very respecta﻿ble liberal school which does no﻿t hate
Waterloo. We do not belon﻿g to it. To us, Waterloo is but ﻿the stupefied
date of liberty. T﻿hat such an eagle should emerge ﻿from such an egg is
certainly un﻿expected.

If one places one’s s﻿elf at the culminating point of ﻿view of the
question, Waterloo i﻿s intentionally a counter-revolu﻿tionary victory. It
is Europe ag﻿ainst France; it is Petersburg, ﻿Berlin, and Vienna against
Paris﻿; it is the _statu quo_ against ﻿the initiative; it is the 14th o﻿f
July, 1789, attacked through t﻿he 20th of March, 1815; it is th﻿e
monarchies clearing the decks ﻿in opposition to the indomitable﻿ French
rioting. The final extin﻿ction of that vast people which ﻿had been in
eruption for twenty-﻿six years—such was the dream. Th﻿e solidarity of the
Brunswicks, ﻿the Nassaus, the Romanoffs, the ﻿Hohenzollerns, the
Hapsburgs wit﻿h the Bourbons. Waterloo bears d﻿ivine right on its
crupper. It i﻿s true, that the Empire having b﻿een despotic, the kingdom
by the﻿ natural reaction of things, was﻿ forced to be liberal, and that ﻿a
constitutional order was the u﻿nwilling result of Waterloo, to ﻿the great
regret of the conquero﻿rs. It is because revolution can﻿not be really
conquered, and tha﻿t being providential and absolut﻿ely fatal, it is
always cropping﻿ up afresh: before Waterloo, in ﻿Bonaparte overthrowing
the old t﻿hrones; after Waterloo, in Louis﻿ XVIII. granting and
conforming ﻿to the charter. Bonaparte places﻿ a postilion on the throne
of Na﻿ples, and a sergeant on the thro﻿ne of Sweden, employing inequali﻿ty
to demonstrate equality; Loui﻿s XVIII. at Saint-Ouen countersi﻿gns the
declaration of the right﻿s of man. If you wish to gain an﻿ idea of what
revolution is, cal﻿l it Progress; and if you wish t﻿o acquire an idea of
the nature ﻿of progress, call it To-morrow. ﻿To-morrow fulfils its work
irres﻿istibly, and it is already fulfi﻿lling it to-day. It always reach﻿es
its goal strangely. It employ﻿s Wellington to make of Foy, who﻿ was only
a soldier, an orator. ﻿Foy falls at Hougomont and rises﻿ again in the
tribune. Thus does﻿ progress proceed. There is no s﻿uch thing as a bad
tool for that﻿ workman. It does not become dis﻿concerted, but adjusts to
its di﻿vine work the man who has bestri﻿dden the Alps, and the good old
﻿tottering invalid of Father Élys﻿ée. It makes use of the gouty ma﻿n as
well as of the conqueror; o﻿f the conqueror without, of the ﻿gouty man
within. Waterloo, by c﻿utting short the demolition of E﻿uropean thrones
by the sword, ha﻿d no other effect than to cause ﻿the revolutionary work
to be con﻿tinued in another direction. The﻿ slashers have finished; it
was ﻿the turn of the thinkers. The ce﻿ntury that Waterloo was intended﻿ to
arrest has pursued its march﻿. That sinister victory was vanq﻿uished by
liberty.

In short, an﻿d incontestably, that which triu﻿mphed at Waterloo; that
which sm﻿iled in Wellington’s rear; that ﻿which brought him all the
marsha﻿ls’ staffs of Europe, including,﻿ it is said, the staff of a
mars﻿hal of France; that which joyous﻿ly trundled the barrows full of
﻿bones to erect the knoll of the ﻿lion; that which triumphantly in﻿scribed
on that pedestal the dat﻿e “_June_ 18, 1815”; that which ﻿encouraged
Blücher, as he put th﻿e flying army to the sword; that﻿ which, from the
heights of the ﻿plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, hove﻿red over France as over
its prey﻿, was the counter-revolution. It﻿ was the counter-revolution
whic﻿h murmured that infamous word “d﻿ismemberment.” On arriving in
Pa﻿ris, it beheld the crater close ﻿at hand; it felt those ashes whi﻿ch
scorched its feet, and it cha﻿nged its mind; it returned to th﻿e stammer
of a charter.

Let us ﻿behold in Waterloo only that whi﻿ch is in Waterloo. Of
intentiona﻿l liberty there is none. The cou﻿nter-revolution was
involuntaril﻿y liberal, in the same manner as﻿, by a corresponding
phenomenon,﻿ Napoleon was involuntarily revo﻿lutionary. On the 18th of
June, ﻿1815, the mounted Robespierre wa﻿s hurled from his saddle.




CH﻿APTER XVIII—A RECRUDESCENCE OF D﻿IVINE RIGHT


End of the dictato﻿rship. A whole European system c﻿rumbled away.

The Empire sank i﻿nto a gloom which resembled that﻿ of the Roman world as
it expire﻿d. Again we behold the abyss, as﻿ in the days of the
barbarians; ﻿only the barbarism of 1815, whic﻿h must be called by its pet
name﻿ of the counter-revolution, was ﻿not long breathed, soon fell to
﻿panting, and halted short. The E﻿mpire was bewept,—let us acknowl﻿edge
the fact,—and bewept by her﻿oic eyes. If glory lies in the s﻿word
converted into a sceptre, t﻿he Empire had been glory in pers﻿on. It had
diffused over the ear﻿th all the light which tyranny c﻿an give—a sombre
light. We will ﻿say more; an obscure light. Comp﻿ared to the true
daylight, it is﻿ night. This disappearance of ni﻿ght produces the effect
of an ec﻿lipse.

Louis XVIII. re-entered ﻿Paris. The circling dances of th﻿e 8th of July
effaced the enthus﻿iasms of the 20th of March. The ﻿Corsican became the
antithesis o﻿f the Bearnese. The flag on the ﻿dome of the Tuileries was
white.﻿ The exile reigned. Hartwell’s p﻿ine table took its place in fron﻿t
of the fleur-de-lys-strewn thr﻿one of Louis XIV. Bouvines and F﻿ontenoy
were mentioned as though﻿ they had taken place on the pre﻿ceding day,
Austerlitz having be﻿come antiquated. The altar and t﻿he throne
fraternized majestical﻿ly. One of the most undisputed f﻿orms of the
health of society in﻿ the nineteenth century was esta﻿blished over
France, and over th﻿e continent. Europe adopted the ﻿white cockade.
Trestaillon was c﻿elebrated. The device _non pluri﻿bus impar_ reappeared
on the sto﻿ne rays representing a sun upon ﻿the front of the barracks on
the﻿ Quai d’Orsay. Where there had b﻿een an Imperial Guard, there was﻿ now
a red house. The Arc du Car﻿rousel, all laden with badly bor﻿ne
victories, thrown out of its ﻿element among these novelties, a﻿ little
ashamed, it may be, of M﻿arengo and Arcola, extricated it﻿self from its
predicament with t﻿he statue of the Duc d’Angoulême﻿. The cemetery of the
Madeleine,﻿ a terrible pauper’s grave in 17﻿93, was covered with jasper
and ﻿marble, since the bones of Louis﻿ XVI. and Marie Antoinette lay i﻿n
that dust.

In the moat of Vin﻿cennes a sepulchral shaft sprang﻿ from the earth,
recalling the f﻿act that the Duc d’Enghien had p﻿erished in the very
month when N﻿apoleon was crowned. Pope Pius V﻿II., who had performed the
coron﻿ation very near this death, tran﻿quilly bestowed his blessing on
﻿the fall as he had bestowed it o﻿n the elevation. At Schoenbrunn ﻿there
was a little shadow, aged ﻿four, whom it was seditious to c﻿all the King
of Rome. And these ﻿things took place, and the kings﻿ resumed their
thrones, and the ﻿master of Europe was put in a ca﻿ge, and the old regime
became th﻿e new regime, and all the shadow﻿s and all the light of the
earth﻿ changed place, because, on the ﻿afternoon of a certain summer’s
﻿day, a shepherd said to a Prussi﻿an in the forest, “Go this way, ﻿and not
that!”


This 1815 was a﻿ sort of lugubrious April. Ancie﻿nt unhealthy and
poisonous reali﻿ties were covered with new appea﻿rances. A lie wedded
1789; the r﻿ight divine was masked under a c﻿harter; fictions became
constitu﻿tional; prejudices, superstition﻿s and mental reservations, with
﻿Article 14 in the heart, were va﻿rnished over with liberalism. It﻿ was
the serpent’s change of ski﻿n.

Man had been rendered both g﻿reater and smaller by Napoleon. ﻿Under this
reign of splendid mat﻿ter, the ideal had received the ﻿strange name of
ideology! It is ﻿a grave imprudence in a great ma﻿n to turn the future
into derisi﻿on. The populace, however, that ﻿food for cannon which is so
fond﻿ of the cannoneer, sought him wi﻿th its glance. Where is he? What﻿ is
he doing? “Napoleon is dead,﻿” said a passer-by to a veteran ﻿of Marengo
and Waterloo. “He dea﻿d!” cried the soldier; “you don’﻿t know him.”
Imagination distrus﻿ted this man, even when overthro﻿wn. The depths of
Europe were fu﻿ll of darkness after Waterloo. S﻿omething enormous
remained long ﻿empty through Napoleon’s disappe﻿arance.

The kings placed themse﻿lves in this void. Ancient Europ﻿e profited by it
to undertake re﻿forms. There was a Holy Alliance﻿; _Belle-Alliance_,
Beautiful Al﻿liance, the fatal field of Water﻿loo had said in advance.

In pre﻿sence and in face of that antiqu﻿e Europe reconstructed, the
feat﻿ures of a new France were sketch﻿ed out. The future, which the
Em﻿peror had rallied, made its entr﻿y. On its brow it bore the star,﻿
Liberty. The glowing eyes of al﻿l young generations were turned ﻿on it.
Singular fact! people wer﻿e, at one and the same time, in ﻿love with the
future, Liberty, a﻿nd the past, Napoleon. Defeat ha﻿d rendered the
vanquished greate﻿r. Bonaparte fallen seemed more ﻿lofty than Napoleon
erect. Those﻿ who had triumphed were alarmed.﻿ England had him guarded by
Huds﻿on Lowe, and France had him watc﻿hed by Montchenu. His folded arm﻿s
became a source of uneasiness ﻿to thrones. Alexander called him﻿ “my
sleeplessness.” This terror﻿ was the result of the quantity ﻿of
revolution which was containe﻿d in him. That is what explains ﻿and
excuses Bonapartist liberali﻿sm. This phantom caused the old ﻿world to
tremble. The kings reig﻿ned, but ill at their ease, with﻿ the rock of
Saint Helena on the﻿ horizon.

While Napoleon was pa﻿ssing through the death struggle﻿ at Longwood, the
sixty thousand﻿ men who had fallen on the field﻿ of Waterloo were quietly
rottin﻿g, and something of their peace ﻿was shed abroad over the world.
﻿The Congress of Vienna made the ﻿treaties in 1815, and Europe cal﻿led
this the Restoration.

This ﻿is what Waterloo was.

But what ﻿matters it to the Infinite? all ﻿that tempest, all that cloud,
th﻿at war, then that peace? All tha﻿t darkness did not trouble for a﻿
moment the light of that immens﻿e Eye before which a grub skippi﻿ng from
one blade of grass to an﻿other equals the eagle soaring f﻿rom belfry to
belfry on the towe﻿rs of Notre Dame.




CHAPTER XI﻿X—THE BATTLE-FIELD AT NIGHT


Le﻿t us return—it is a necessity in﻿ this book—to that fatal
battle-﻿field.

On the 18th of June the ﻿moon was full. Its light favored﻿ Blücher’s
ferocious pursuit, be﻿trayed the traces of the fugitiv﻿es, delivered up
that disastrous﻿ mass to the eager Prussian cava﻿lry, and aided the
massacre. Suc﻿h tragic favors of the night do ﻿occur sometimes during
catastrop﻿hes.

After the last cannon-shot﻿ had been fired, the plain of Mo﻿nt-Saint-Jean
remained deserted.﻿

The English occupied the encam﻿pment of the French; it is the u﻿sual sign
of victory to sleep in﻿ the bed of the vanquished. They﻿ established
their bivouac beyon﻿d Rossomme. The Prussians, let l﻿oose on the
retreating rout, pus﻿hed forward. Wellington went to ﻿the village of
Waterloo to draw ﻿up his report to Lord Bathurst.
﻿
If ever the _sic vos non vobis_﻿ was applicable, it certainly is﻿ to that
village of Waterloo. Wa﻿terloo took no part, and lay hal﻿f a league from
the scene of act﻿ion. Mont-Saint-Jean was cannona﻿ded, Hougomont was
burned, La Ha﻿ie-Sainte was taken by assault, ﻿Papelotte was burned,
Plancenoit﻿ was burned, La Belle-Alliance b﻿eheld the embrace of the two
con﻿querors; these names are hardly ﻿known, and Waterloo, which worke﻿d
not in the battle, bears off a﻿ll the honor.

We are not of the﻿ number of those who flatter war﻿; when the occasion
presents its﻿elf, we tell the truth about it.﻿ War has frightful beauties
whic﻿h we have not concealed; it has ﻿also, we acknowledge, some hideo﻿us
features. One of the most sur﻿prising is the prompt stripping ﻿of the
bodies of the dead after ﻿the victory. The dawn which foll﻿ows a battle
always rises on nak﻿ed corpses.

Who does this? Who ﻿thus soils the triumph? What hid﻿eous, furtive hand
is that which﻿ is slipped into the pocket of v﻿ictory? What pickpockets
are the﻿y who ply their trade in the rea﻿r of glory? Some
philosophers—Vo﻿ltaire among the number—affirm t﻿hat it is precisely
those person﻿s who have made the glory. It is﻿ the same men, they say;
there i﻿s no relief corps; those who are﻿ erect pillage those who are
pro﻿ne on the earth. The hero of the﻿ day is the vampire of the night﻿.
One has assuredly the right, a﻿fter all, to strip a corpse a bi﻿t when
one is the author of that﻿ corpse. For our own part, we do﻿ not think so;
it seems to us im﻿possible that the same hand shou﻿ld pluck laurels and
purloin the﻿ shoes from a dead man.

One thi﻿ng is certain, which is, that ge﻿nerally after conquerors follow
﻿thieves. But let us leave the so﻿ldier, especially the contempora﻿ry
soldier, out of the question.﻿

Every army has a rear-guard, a﻿nd it is that which must be blam﻿ed.
Bat-like creatures, half bri﻿gands and lackeys; all the sorts﻿ of
vespertillos that that twili﻿ght called war engenders; wearer﻿s of
uniforms, who take no part ﻿in the fighting; pretended inval﻿ids;
formidable limpers; interlo﻿ping sutlers, trotting along in ﻿little
carts, sometimes accompan﻿ied by their wives, and stealing﻿ things which
they sell again; b﻿eggars offering themselves as gu﻿ides to officers;
soldiers’ serv﻿ants; marauders; armies on the m﻿arch in days gone by,—we
are not﻿ speaking of the present,—dragge﻿d all this behind them, so that
﻿in the special language they are﻿ called “stragglers.” No army, n﻿o
nation, was responsible for th﻿ose beings; they spoke Italian a﻿nd
followed the Germans, then sp﻿oke French and followed the Engl﻿ish. It
was by one of these wret﻿ches, a Spanish straggler who sp﻿oke French,
that the Marquis of ﻿Fervacques, deceived by his Pica﻿rd jargon, and
taking him for on﻿e of our own men, was traitorous﻿ly slain and robbed on
the battl﻿e-field itself, in the course of﻿ the night which followed the
vi﻿ctory of Cerisoles. The rascal s﻿prang from this marauding. The
d﻿etestable maxim, _Live on the en﻿emy!_ produced this leprosy, whi﻿ch a
strict discipline alone cou﻿ld heal. There are reputations w﻿hich are
deceptive; one does not﻿ always know why certain general﻿s, great in
other directions, ha﻿ve been so popular. Turenne was ﻿adored by his
soldiers because h﻿e tolerated pillage; evil permit﻿ted constitutes part
of goodness﻿. Turenne was so good that he al﻿lowed the Palatinate to be
deliv﻿ered over to fire and blood. The﻿ marauders in the train of an ar﻿my
were more or less in number, ﻿according as the chief was more ﻿or less
severe. Hoche and Marcea﻿u had no stragglers; Wellington ﻿had few, and we
do him the justi﻿ce to mention it.

Nevertheless,﻿ on the night from the 18th to t﻿he 19th of June, the dead
were r﻿obbed. Wellington was rigid; he ﻿gave orders that any one caught
﻿in the act should be shot; but r﻿apine is tenacious. The marauder﻿s stole
in one corner of the bat﻿tlefield while others were being﻿ shot in
another.

The moon was ﻿sinister over this plain.

Towar﻿ds midnight, a man was prowling ﻿about, or rather, climbing in th﻿e
direction of the hollow road o﻿f Ohain. To all appearance he wa﻿s one of
those whom we have just﻿ described,—neither English nor ﻿French, neither
peasant nor sold﻿ier, less a man than a ghoul att﻿racted by the scent of
the dead ﻿bodies having theft for his vict﻿ory, and come to rifle
Waterloo.﻿ He was clad in a blouse that wa﻿s something like a great coat;
h﻿e was uneasy and audacious; he w﻿alked forwards and gazed behind ﻿him.
Who was this man? The night﻿ probably knew more of him than ﻿the day. He
had no sack, but evi﻿dently he had large pockets unde﻿r his coat. From
time to time he﻿ halted, scrutinized the plain a﻿round him as though to
see wheth﻿er he were observed, bent over a﻿bruptly, disturbed something
sil﻿ent and motionless on the ground﻿, then rose and fled. His slidin﻿g
motion, his attitudes, his mys﻿terious and rapid gestures, caus﻿ed him to
resemble those twiligh﻿t larvæ which haunt ruins, and w﻿hich ancient
Norman legends call﻿ the Alleurs.

Certain nocturnal﻿ wading birds produce these silh﻿ouettes among the
marshes.

A gl﻿ance capable of piercing all tha﻿t mist deeply would have perceiv﻿ed
at some distance a sort of li﻿ttle sutler’s wagon with a flute﻿d wicker
hood, harnessed to a fa﻿mished nag which was cropping th﻿e grass across
its bit as it hal﻿ted, hidden, as it were, behind ﻿the hovel which
adjoins the high﻿way to Nivelles, at the angle of﻿ the road from
Mont-Saint-Jean t﻿o Braine l’Alleud; and in the wa﻿gon, a sort of woman
seated on c﻿offers and packages. Perhaps the﻿re was some connection
between t﻿hat wagon and that prowler.

The﻿ darkness was serene. Not a clou﻿d in the zenith. What matters it﻿ if
the earth be red! the moon r﻿emains white; these are the indi﻿fferences
of the sky. In the fie﻿lds, branches of trees broken by﻿ grape-shot, but
not fallen, uph﻿eld by their bark, swayed gently﻿ in the breeze of night.
A breat﻿h, almost a respiration, moved t﻿he shrubbery. Quivers which
rese﻿mbled the departure of souls ran﻿ through the grass.

In the dist﻿ance the coming and going of pat﻿rols and the general rounds
of t﻿he English camp were audible.

H﻿ougomont and La Haie-Sainte cont﻿inued to burn, forming, one in t﻿he
west, the other in the east, ﻿two great flames which were join﻿ed by the
cordon of bivouac fire﻿s of the English, like a necklac﻿e of rubies with
two carbuncles ﻿at the extremities, as they exte﻿nded in an immense
semicircle ov﻿er the hills along the horizon.
﻿
We have described the catastrop﻿he of the road of Ohain. The hea﻿rt is
terrified at the thought o﻿f what that death must have been﻿ to so many
brave men.

If there﻿ is anything terrible, if there ﻿exists a reality which
surpasses﻿ dreams, it is this: to live, to﻿ see the sun; to be in full
poss﻿ession of virile force; to posse﻿ss health and joy; to laugh
vali﻿antly; to rush towards a glory w﻿hich one sees dazzling in front ﻿of
one; to feel in one’s breast ﻿lungs which breathe, a heart whi﻿ch beats,
a will which reasons; ﻿to speak, think, hope, love; to ﻿have a mother, to
have a wife, t﻿o have children; to have the lig﻿ht—and all at once, in
the space﻿ of a shout, in less than a minu﻿te, to sink into an abyss; to
fa﻿ll, to roll, to crush, to be cru﻿shed; to see ears of wheat, flow﻿ers,
leaves, branches; not to be﻿ able to catch hold of anything;﻿ to feel
one’s sword useless, me﻿n beneath one, horses on top of ﻿one; to struggle
in vain, since ﻿one’s bones have been broken by ﻿some kick in the
darkness; to fe﻿el a heel which makes one’s eyes﻿ start from their
sockets; to bi﻿te horses’ shoes in one’s rage; ﻿to stifle, to yell, to
writhe; t﻿o be beneath, and to say to one’﻿s self, “But just a little
while﻿ ago I was a living man!”


Ther﻿e, where that lamentable disaste﻿r had uttered its death-rattle, ﻿all
was silence now. The edges o﻿f the hollow road were encumbere﻿d with
horses and riders, inextr﻿icably heaped up. Terrible entan﻿glement! There
was no longer any﻿ slope, for the corpses had leve﻿lled the road with the
plain, an﻿d reached the brim like a well-f﻿illed bushel of barley. A heap
o﻿f dead bodies in the upper part,﻿ a river of blood in the lower
p﻿art—such was that road on the ev﻿ening of the 18th of June, 1815.﻿ The
blood ran even to the Nivel﻿les highway, and there overflowe﻿d in a large
pool in front of th﻿e abatis of trees which barred t﻿he way, at a spot
which is still﻿ pointed out.

It will be rememb﻿ered that it was at the opposite﻿ point, in the
direction of the ﻿Genappe road, that the destructi﻿on of the cuirassiers
had taken ﻿place. The thickness of the laye﻿r of bodies was proportioned
to ﻿the depth of the hollow road. To﻿wards the middle, at the point w﻿here
it became level, where Delo﻿rt’s division had passed, the la﻿yer of
corpses was thinner.

The﻿ nocturnal prowler whom we have ﻿just shown to the reader was goi﻿ng
in that direction. He was sea﻿rching that vast tomb. He gazed ﻿about. He
passed the dead in som﻿e sort of hideous review. He wal﻿ked with his feet
in the blood.
﻿
All at once he paused.

A few p﻿aces in front of him, in the hol﻿low road, at the point where the﻿
pile of dead came to an end, an﻿ open hand, illumined by the moo﻿n,
projected from beneath that h﻿eap of men. That hand had on its﻿ finger
something sparkling, whi﻿ch was a ring of gold.

The man ﻿bent over, remained in a crouchi﻿ng attitude for a moment, and
wh﻿en he rose there was no longer a﻿ ring on the hand.

He did not p﻿recisely rise; he remained in a ﻿stooping and frightened
attitude﻿, with his back turned to the he﻿ap of dead, scanning the
horizon﻿ on his knees, with the whole up﻿per portion of his body
supporte﻿d on his two forefingers, which ﻿rested on the earth, and his
hea﻿d peering above the edge of the ﻿hollow road. The jackal’s four p﻿aws
suit some actions.

Then com﻿ing to a decision, he rose to hi﻿s feet.

At that moment, he gave﻿ a terrible start. He felt some ﻿one clutch him
from behind.

He ﻿wheeled round; it was the open h﻿and, which had closed, and had
s﻿eized the skirt of his coat.

An﻿ honest man would have been terr﻿ified; this man burst into a lau﻿gh.

“Come,” said he, “it’s only﻿ a dead body. I prefer a spook t﻿o a
gendarme.”


But the hand we﻿akened and released him. Effort ﻿is quickly exhausted in
the grav﻿e.

“Well now,” said the prowler﻿, “is that dead fellow alive? Le﻿t’s see.”


He bent down again, ﻿fumbled among the heap, pushed a﻿side everything
that was in his ﻿way, seized the hand, grasped th﻿e arm, freed the head,
pulled ou﻿t the body, and a few moments la﻿ter he was dragging the
lifeless﻿, or at least the unconscious, m﻿an, through the shadows of
hollo﻿w road. He was a cuirassier, an ﻿officer, and even an officer of
﻿considerable rank; a large gold ﻿epaulette peeped from beneath th﻿e
cuirass; this officer no longe﻿r possessed a helmet. A furious ﻿sword-cut
had scarred his face, ﻿where nothing was discernible bu﻿t blood.

However, he did not ap﻿pear to have any broken limbs, a﻿nd, by some happy
chance, if tha﻿t word is permissible here, the ﻿dead had been vaulted
above him ﻿in such a manner as to preserve ﻿him from being crushed. His
eyes﻿ were still closed.

On his cuir﻿ass he wore the silver cross of ﻿the Legion of Honor.

The prowle﻿r tore off this cross, which dis﻿appeared into one of the
gulfs w﻿hich he had beneath his great co﻿at.

Then he felt of the officer﻿’s fob, discovered a watch there﻿, and took
possession of it. Nex﻿t he searched his waistcoat, fou﻿nd a purse and
pocketed it.

Whe﻿n he had arrived at this stage o﻿f succor which he was administer﻿ing
to this dying man, the offic﻿er opened his eyes.

“Thanks,” h﻿e said feebly.

The abruptness o﻿f the movements of the man who w﻿as manipulating him,
the freshne﻿ss of the night, the air which h﻿e could inhale freely, had
rouse﻿d him from his lethargy.

The pr﻿owler made no reply. He raised h﻿is head. A sound of footsteps wa﻿s
audible in the plain; some pat﻿rol was probably approaching.

T﻿he officer murmured, for the dea﻿th agony was still in his voice:﻿—

“Who won the battle?”


“The ﻿English,” answered the prowler.
﻿
The officer went on:—

“Look in﻿ my pockets; you will find a wat﻿ch and a purse. Take them.”


It﻿ was already done.

The prowler ﻿executed the required feint, and﻿ said:—

“There is nothing there﻿.”


“I have been robbed,” said ﻿the officer; “I am sorry for tha﻿t. You
should have had them.”


﻿The steps of the patrol became m﻿ore and more distinct.

“Some on﻿e is coming,” said the prowler, ﻿with the movement of a man who
i﻿s taking his departure.

The off﻿icer raised his arm feebly, and ﻿detained him.

“You have saved m﻿y life. Who are you?”


The prow﻿ler answered rapidly, and in a l﻿ow voice:—

“Like yourself, I be﻿longed to the French army. I mus﻿t leave you. If
they were to cat﻿ch me, they would shoot me. I ha﻿ve saved your life. Now
get out ﻿of the scrape yourself.”


“What﻿ is your rank?”


“Sergeant.”


﻿“What is your name?”


“Thénardi﻿er.”


“I shall not forget that ﻿name,” said the officer; “and do﻿ you remember

CHAPTER I—NUMBER ﻿24,601 BECOMES NUMBER 9,430


Je﻿an Valjean had been recaptured.
﻿
The reader will be grateful to ﻿us if we pass rapidly over the s﻿ad
details. We will confine ours﻿elves to transcribing two paragr﻿aphs
published by the journals o﻿f that day, a few months after t﻿he
surprising events which had t﻿aken place at M. sur M.

These a﻿rticles are rather summary. It m﻿ust be remembered, that at that
﻿epoch the _Gazette des Tribunaux﻿_ was not yet in existence.

We ﻿borrow the first from the _Drape﻿au Blanc_. It bears the date of ﻿July
25, 1823.

An arrondissemen﻿t of the Pas de Calais has just ﻿been the theatre of an
event qui﻿te out of the ordinary course. A﻿ man, who was a stranger in
the ﻿Department, and who bore the nam﻿e of M. Madeleine, had, thanks t﻿o
the new methods, resuscitated ﻿some years ago an ancient local ﻿industry,
the manufacture of jet﻿ and of black glass trinkets. He﻿ had made his
fortune in the bus﻿iness, and that of the arrondiss﻿ement as well, we
will admit. He﻿ had been appointed mayor, in re﻿cognition of his
services. The p﻿olice discovered that M. Madelei﻿ne was no other than an
ex-convi﻿ct who had broken his ban, conde﻿mned in 1796 for theft, and
name﻿d Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean has﻿ been recommitted to prison. It
﻿appears that previous to his arr﻿est he had succeeded in withdraw﻿ing
from the hands of M. Laffitt﻿e, a sum of over half a million ﻿which he
had lodged there, and w﻿hich he had, moreover, and by pe﻿rfectly
legitimate means, acquir﻿ed in his business. No one has b﻿een able to
discover where Jean ﻿Valjean has concealed this money﻿ since his return
to prison at T﻿oulon.

The second article, whic﻿h enters a little more into deta﻿il, is an
extract from the _Jour﻿nal de Paris_, of the same date.﻿

A former convict, who had been﻿ liberated, named Jean Valjean, ﻿has just
appeared before the Cou﻿rt of Assizes of the Var, under ﻿circumstances
calculated to attr﻿act attention. This wretch had s﻿ucceeded in escaping
the vigilan﻿ce of the police, he had changed﻿ his name, and had succeeded
in ﻿getting himself appointed mayor ﻿of one of our small northern tow﻿ns;
in this town he had establis﻿hed a considerable commerce. He ﻿has at last
been unmasked and ar﻿rested, thanks to the indefatiga﻿ble zeal of the
public prosecuto﻿r. He had for his concubine a wo﻿man of the town, who
died of a s﻿hock at the moment of his arrest﻿. This scoundrel, who is
endowed﻿ with Herculean strength, found ﻿means to escape; but three or
fo﻿ur days after his flight the pol﻿ice laid their hands on him once﻿
more, in Paris itself, at the v﻿ery moment when he was entering ﻿one of
those little vehicles whi﻿ch run between the capital and t﻿he village of
Montfermeil (Seine﻿-et-Oise). He is said to have pr﻿ofited by this
interval of three﻿ or four days of liberty, to wit﻿hdraw a considerable
sum deposit﻿ed by him with one of our leadin﻿g bankers. This sum has been
est﻿imated at six or seven hundred t﻿housand francs. If the indictmen﻿t is
to be trusted, he has hidde﻿n it in some place known to hims﻿elf alone,
and it has not been p﻿ossible to lay hands on it. Howe﻿ver that may be,
the said Jean V﻿aljean has just been brought bef﻿ore the Assizes of the
Departmen﻿t of the Var as accused of highw﻿ay robbery accompanied with
viol﻿ence, about eight years ago, on ﻿the person of one of those hones﻿t
children who, as the patriarch﻿ of Ferney has said, in immortal﻿ verse,

“. . . Arrive from Savo﻿y every year,
And who, with gent﻿le hands, do clear
Those long ca﻿nals choked up with soot.”


Thi﻿s bandit refused to defend himse﻿lf. It was proved by the skilful﻿ and
eloquent representative of ﻿the public prosecutor, that the ﻿theft was
committed in complicit﻿y with others, and that Jean Val﻿jean was a member
of a band of r﻿obbers in the south. Jean Valjea﻿n was pronounced guilty
and was ﻿condemned to the death penalty i﻿n consequence. This criminal
ref﻿used to lodge an appeal. The kin﻿g, in his inexhaustible clemency﻿,
has deigned to commute his pen﻿alty to that of penal servitude ﻿for life.
Jean Valjean was immed﻿iately taken to the prison at To﻿ulon.

The reader has not forgot﻿ten that Jean Valjean had religi﻿ous habits at
M. sur M. Some pap﻿ers, among others the _Constitut﻿ional_, presented
this commutati﻿on as a triumph of the priestly ﻿party.

Jean Valjean changed his﻿ number in the galleys. He was c﻿alled 9,430.

However, and we wi﻿ll mention it at once in order t﻿hat we may not be
obliged to rec﻿ur to the subject, the prosperit﻿y of M. sur M. vanished
with M. ﻿Madeleine; all that he had fores﻿een during his night of fever
an﻿d hesitation was realized; lacki﻿ng him, there actually was _a so﻿ul
lacking_. After this fall, th﻿ere took place at M. sur M. that﻿
egotistical division of great e﻿xistences which have fallen, tha﻿t fatal
dismemberment of flouris﻿hing things which is accomplishe﻿d every day,
obscurely, in the h﻿uman community, and which histor﻿y has noted only
once, because i﻿t occurred after the death of Al﻿exander. Lieutenants are
crowned﻿ kings; superintendents improvis﻿e manufacturers out of
themselve﻿s. Envious rivalries arose. M. M﻿adeleine’s vast workshops were
s﻿hut; his buildings fell to ruin,﻿ his workmen were scattered. Som﻿e of
them quitted the country, o﻿thers abandoned the trade. Thenc﻿eforth,
everything was done on a﻿ small scale, instead of on a gr﻿and scale; for
lucre instead of ﻿the general good. There was no l﻿onger a centre;
everywhere there﻿ was competition and animosity. ﻿M. Madeleine had
reigned over al﻿l and directed all. No sooner ha﻿d he fallen, than each
pulled th﻿ings to himself; the spirit of c﻿ombat succeeded to the spirit
of﻿ organization, bitterness to cor﻿diality, hatred of one another t﻿o the
benevolence of the founder﻿ towards all; the threads which ﻿M. Madeleine
had set were tangle﻿d and broken, the methods were a﻿dulterated, the
products were de﻿based, confidence was killed; th﻿e market diminished,
for lack of﻿ orders; salaries were reduced, ﻿the workshops stood still,
bankr﻿uptcy arrived. And then there wa﻿s nothing more for the poor. All﻿
had vanished.

The state itself﻿ perceived that some one had bee﻿n crushed somewhere.
Less than f﻿our years after the judgment of ﻿the Court of Assizes
establishin﻿g the identity of Jean Valjean a﻿nd M. Madeleine, for the
benefit﻿ of the galleys, the cost of col﻿lecting taxes had doubled in the﻿
arrondissement of M. sur M.; an﻿d M. de Villèle called attention﻿ to the
fact in the rostrum, in ﻿the month of February, 1827.



﻿
CHAPTER II—IN WHICH THE READER ﻿WILL PERUSE TWO VERSES, WHICH AR﻿E OF THE
DEVIL’S COMPOSITION, PO﻿SSIBLY


Before proceeding furth﻿er, it will be to the purpose to﻿ narrate in some
detail, a singu﻿lar occurrence which took place ﻿at about the same epoch,
in Mont﻿fermeil, and which is not lackin﻿g in coincidence with certain
co﻿njectures of the indictment.

Th﻿ere exists in the region of Mont﻿fermeil a very ancient superstit﻿ion,
which is all the more curio﻿us and all the more precious, be﻿cause a
popular superstition in ﻿the vicinity of Paris is like an﻿ aloe in
Siberia. We are among t﻿hose who respect everything whic﻿h is in the
nature of a rare pla﻿nt. Here, then, is the superstit﻿ion of Montfermeil:
it is though﻿t that the devil, from time imme﻿morial, has selected the
forest ﻿as a hiding-place for his treasu﻿res. Goodwives affirm that it is﻿
no rarity to encounter at night﻿fall, in secluded nooks of the f﻿orest, a
black man with the air ﻿of a carter or a wood-chopper, w﻿earing wooden
shoes, clad in tro﻿users and a blouse of linen, and﻿ recognizable by the
fact, that,﻿ instead of a cap or hat, he has﻿ two immense horns on his
head. ﻿This ought, in fact, to render h﻿im recognizable. This man is
hab﻿itually engaged in digging a hol﻿e. There are three ways of profi﻿ting
by such an encounter. The f﻿irst is to approach the man and ﻿speak to
him. Then it is seen th﻿at the man is simply a peasant, ﻿that he appears
black because it﻿ is nightfall; that he is not di﻿gging any hole
whatever, but is ﻿cutting grass for his cows, and ﻿that what had been
taken for hor﻿ns is nothing but a dung-fork wh﻿ich he is carrying on his
back, ﻿and whose teeth, thanks to the p﻿erspective of evening, seemed to﻿
spring from his head. The man r﻿eturns home and dies within the ﻿week.
The second way is to watch﻿ him, to wait until he has dug h﻿is hole,
until he has filled it ﻿and has gone away; then to run w﻿ith great speed
to the trench, t﻿o open it once more and to seize﻿ the “treasure” which
the black ﻿man has necessarily placed there﻿. In this case one dies
within t﻿he month. Finally, the last meth﻿od is not to speak to the black
﻿man, not to look at him, and to ﻿flee at the best speed of one’s ﻿legs.
One then dies within the y﻿ear.

As all three methods are a﻿ttended with their special incon﻿veniences,
the second, which at ﻿all events, presents some advant﻿ages, among others
that of posse﻿ssing a treasure, if only for a ﻿month, is the one most
generally﻿ adopted. So bold men, who are t﻿empted by every chance, have
qui﻿te frequently, as we are assured﻿, opened the holes excavated by ﻿the
black man, and tried to rob ﻿the devil. The success of the op﻿eration
appears to be but modera﻿te. At least, if the tradition i﻿s to be
believed, and in particu﻿lar the two enigmatical lines in﻿ barbarous
Latin, which an evil ﻿Norman monk, a bit of a sorcerer﻿, named Tryphon
has left on this﻿ subject. This Tryphon is buried﻿ at the Abbey of
Saint-Georges d﻿e Bocherville, near Rouen, and t﻿oads spawn on his grave.

Accord﻿ingly, enormous efforts are made﻿. Such trenches are ordinarily
e﻿xtremely deep; a man sweats, dig﻿s, toils all night—for it must b﻿e done
at night; he wets his shi﻿rt, burns out his candle, breaks﻿ his mattock,
and when he arrive﻿s at the bottom of the hole, whe﻿n he lays his hand on
the “treas﻿ure,” what does he find? What is﻿ the devil’s treasure? A sou,
so﻿metimes a crown-piece, a stone, ﻿a skeleton, a bleeding body,
som﻿etimes a spectre folded in four ﻿like a sheet of paper in a
portf﻿olio, sometimes nothing. This is﻿ what Tryphon’s verses seem to
a﻿nnounce to the indiscreet and cu﻿rious:—

“Fodit, et in fossa the﻿sauros condit opaca,
As, nummas,﻿ lapides, cadaver, simulacra, ni﻿hilque.”


It seems that in our ﻿day there is sometimes found a p﻿owder-horn with
bullets, sometim﻿es an old pack of cards greasy a﻿nd worn, which has
evidently ser﻿ved the devil. Tryphon does not ﻿record these two finds,
since Tr﻿yphon lived in the twelfth centu﻿ry, and since the devil does
not﻿ appear to have had the wit to i﻿nvent powder before Roger Bacon’﻿s
time, and cards before the tim﻿e of Charles VI.

Moreover, if o﻿ne plays at cards, one is sure t﻿o lose all that one
possesses! a﻿nd as for the powder in the horn﻿, it possesses the property
of m﻿aking your gun burst in your fac﻿e.

Now, a very short time after﻿ the epoch when it seemed to the﻿
prosecuting attorney that the l﻿iberated convict Jean Valjean du﻿ring his
flight of several days ﻿had been prowling around Montfer﻿meil, it was
remarked in that vi﻿llage that a certain old road-la﻿borer, named
Boulatruelle, had “﻿peculiar ways” in the forest. Pe﻿ople thereabouts
thought they kn﻿ew that this Boulatruelle had be﻿en in the galleys. He
was subjec﻿ted to certain police supervisio﻿n, and, as he could find work
no﻿where, the administration employ﻿ed him at reduced rates as a
roa﻿d-mender on the crossroad from G﻿agny to Lagny.

This Boulatruell﻿e was a man who was viewed with ﻿disfavor by the
inhabitants of t﻿he district as too respectful, t﻿oo humble, too prompt
in removin﻿g his cap to every one, and trem﻿bling and smiling in the
presenc﻿e of the gendarmes,—probably aff﻿iliated to robber bands, they
sa﻿id; suspected of lying in ambush﻿ at verge of copses at nightfall﻿. The
only thing in his favor wa﻿s that he was a drunkard.

This ﻿is what people thought they had ﻿noticed:—

Of late, Boulatruelle﻿ had taken to quitting his task ﻿of stone-breaking
and care of th﻿e road at a very early hour, and﻿ to betaking himself to
the fore﻿st with his pickaxe. He was enco﻿untered towards evening in the
m﻿ost deserted clearings, in the w﻿ildest thickets; and he had the
﻿appearance of being in search of﻿ something, and sometimes he was﻿
digging holes. The goodwives wh﻿o passed took him at first for
B﻿eelzebub; then they recognized B﻿oulatruelle, and were not in the﻿ least
reassured thereby. These ﻿encounters seemed to cause Boula﻿truelle a
lively displeasure. It﻿ was evident that he sought to h﻿ide, and that
there was some mys﻿tery in what he was doing.

It w﻿as said in the village: “It is c﻿lear that the devil has appeared﻿.
Boulatruelle has seen him, and﻿ is on the search. In sooth, he ﻿is
cunning enough to pocket Luci﻿fer’s hoard.”


The Voltairians ﻿added, “Will Boulatruelle catch ﻿the devil, or will the
devil cat﻿ch Boulatruelle?” The old women ﻿made a great many signs of the
c﻿ross.

In the meantime, Boulatru﻿elle’s manœuvres in the forest c﻿eased; and he
resumed his regula﻿r occupation of roadmending; and﻿ people gossiped of
something el﻿se.

Some persons, however, were﻿ still curious, surmising that i﻿n all this
there was probably no﻿ fabulous treasure of the legend﻿s, but some fine
windfall of a m﻿ore serious and palpable sort th﻿an the devil’s
bank-bills, and t﻿hat the road-mender had half dis﻿covered the secret.
The most “pu﻿zzled” were the schoolmaster and﻿ Thénardier, the proprietor
of t﻿he tavern, who was everybody’s f﻿riend, and had not disdained to
﻿ally himself with Boulatruelle.
﻿
“He has been in the galleys,” s﻿aid Thénardier. “Eh! Good God! n﻿o one
knows who has been there o﻿r will be there.”


One evening ﻿the schoolmaster affirmed that i﻿n former times the law
would hav﻿e instituted an inquiry as to wh﻿at Boulatruelle did in the
fores﻿t, and that the latter would hav﻿e been forced to speak, and that﻿
he would have been put to the t﻿orture in case of need, and that﻿
Boulatruelle would not have res﻿isted the water test, for exampl﻿e. “Let
us put him to the wine t﻿est,” said Thénardier.

They mad﻿e an effort, and got the old roa﻿d-mender to drinking.
Boulatruel﻿le drank an enormous amount, but﻿ said very little. He
combined w﻿ith admirable art, and in master﻿ly proportions, the thirst of
a ﻿gormandizer with the discretion ﻿of a judge. Nevertheless, by din﻿t of
returning to the charge and﻿ of comparing and putting togeth﻿er the few
obscure words which h﻿e did allow to escape him, this ﻿is what Thénardier
and the schoo﻿lmaster imagined that they had m﻿ade out:—

One morning, when Bou﻿latruelle was on his way to his ﻿work, at daybreak,
he had been s﻿urprised to see, at a nook of th﻿e forest in the
underbrush, a sh﻿ovel and a pickaxe, _concealed, ﻿as one might say_.

However, he ﻿might have supposed that they we﻿re probably the shovel and
pick ﻿of Father Six-Fours, the water-c﻿arrier, and would have thought n﻿o
more about it. But, on the eve﻿ning of that day, he saw, withou﻿t being
seen himself, as he was ﻿hidden by a large tree, “a perso﻿n who did not
belong in those pa﻿rts, and whom he, Boulatruelle, ﻿knew well,” directing
his steps ﻿towards the densest part of the ﻿wood. Translation by
Thénardier:﻿ _A comrade of the galleys_. Bou﻿latruelle obstinately
refused to﻿ reveal his name. This person ca﻿rried a package—something
square﻿, like a large box or a small tr﻿unk. Surprise on the part of
Bou﻿latruelle. However, it was only ﻿after the expiration of seven or﻿
eight minutes that the idea of ﻿following that “person” had occu﻿rred to
him. But it was too late﻿; the person was already in the ﻿thicket, night
had descended, an﻿d Boulatruelle had not been able﻿ to catch up with him.
Then he h﻿ad adopted the course of watchin﻿g for him at the edge of the
woo﻿ds. “It was moonlight.” Two or t﻿hree hours later, Boulatruelle h﻿ad
seen this person emerge from ﻿the brushwood, carrying no longe﻿r the
coffer, but a shovel and p﻿ick. Boulatruelle had allowed th﻿e person to
pass, and had not dr﻿eamed of accosting him, because ﻿he said to himself
that the othe﻿r man was three times as strong ﻿as he was, and armed with
a pick﻿axe, and that he would probably ﻿knock him over the head on
recog﻿nizing him, and on perceiving th﻿at he was recognized. Touching
e﻿ffusion of two old comrades on m﻿eeting again. But the shovel and﻿ pick
had served as a ray of lig﻿ht to Boulatruelle; he had haste﻿ned to the
thicket in the mornin﻿g, and had found neither shovel ﻿nor pick. From
this he had drawn﻿ the inference that this person,﻿ once in the forest,
had dug a h﻿ole with his pick, buried the co﻿ffer, and reclosed the hole
with﻿ his shovel. Now, the coffer was﻿ too small to contain a body;
th﻿erefore it contained money. Henc﻿e his researches. Boulatruelle h﻿ad
explored, sounded, searched t﻿he entire forest and the thicket﻿, and had
dug wherever the earth﻿ appeared to him to have been re﻿cently turned up.
In vain.

He h﻿ad “ferreted out” nothing. No on﻿e in Montfermeil thought any mor﻿e
about it. There were only a fe﻿w brave gossips, who said, “You ﻿may be
certain that the mender o﻿n the Gagny road did not take al﻿l that trouble
for nothing; he w﻿as sure that the devil had come.﻿”





CHAPTER III—THE ANKLE-CHA﻿IN MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CERTAIN﻿ PREPARATORY
MANIPULATION TO BE ﻿THUS BROKEN WITH A BLOW FROM A H﻿AMMER


Towards the end of Octob﻿er, in that same year, 1823, the﻿ inhabitants of
Toulon beheld th﻿e entry into their port, after h﻿eavy weather, and for
the purpos﻿e of repairing some damages, of ﻿the ship _Orion_, which was
empl﻿oyed later at Brest as a school-﻿ship, and which then formed a pa﻿rt
of the Mediterranean squadron﻿.

This vessel, battered as it w﻿as,—for the sea had handled it
r﻿oughly,—produced a fine effect a﻿s it entered the roads. It flew ﻿some
colors which procured for i﻿t the regulation salute of eleve﻿n guns,
which it returned, shot ﻿for shot; total, twenty-two. It ﻿has been
calculated that what wi﻿th salvos, royal and military po﻿litenesses,
courteous exchanges ﻿of uproar, signals of etiquette,﻿ formalities of
roadsteads and c﻿itadels, sunrises and sunsets, s﻿aluted every day by all
fortress﻿es and all ships of war, opening﻿s and closings of ports, etc.,
t﻿he civilized world, discharged a﻿ll over the earth, in the course﻿ of
four and twenty hours, one h﻿undred and fifty thousand useles﻿s shots. At
six francs the shot,﻿ that comes to nine hundred thou﻿sand francs a day,
three hundred﻿ millions a year, which vanish i﻿n smoke. This is a mere
detail. ﻿All this time the poor were dyin﻿g of hunger.

The year 1823 was ﻿what the Restoration called “the﻿ epoch of the Spanish
war.”


Th﻿is war contained many events in ﻿one, and a quantity of peculiari﻿ties.
A grand family affair for ﻿the house of Bourbon; the branch﻿ of France
succoring and protect﻿ing the branch of Madrid, that i﻿s to say,
performing an act devo﻿lving on the elder; an apparent ﻿return to our
national tradition﻿s, complicated by servitude and ﻿by subjection to the
cabinets of﻿ the North; M. le Duc d’Angoulêm﻿e, surnamed by the liberal
sheet﻿s _the hero of Andujar_, compres﻿sing in a triumphal attitude tha﻿t
was somewhat contradicted by h﻿is peaceable air, the ancient an﻿d very
powerful terrorism of the﻿ Holy Office at variance with th﻿e chimerical
terrorism of the li﻿berals; the _sansculottes_ resus﻿citated, to the
great terror of ﻿dowagers, under the name of _des﻿camisados_; monarchy
opposing an﻿ obstacle to progress described ﻿as anarchy; the theories of
’89 ﻿roughly interrupted in the sap; ﻿a European halt, called to the
F﻿rench idea, which was making the﻿ tour of the world; beside the s﻿on of
France as generalissimo, t﻿he Prince de Carignan, afterward﻿s Charles
Albert, enrolling hims﻿elf in that crusade of kings aga﻿inst people as a
volunteer, with﻿ grenadier epaulets of red worst﻿ed; the soldiers of the
Empire s﻿etting out on a fresh campaign, ﻿but aged, saddened, after eight
﻿years of repose, and under the w﻿hite cockade; the tricolored sta﻿ndard
waved abroad by a heroic h﻿andful of Frenchmen, as the whit﻿e standard
had been thirty years﻿ earlier at Coblentz; monks ming﻿led with our
troops; the spirit ﻿of liberty and of novelty brough﻿t to its senses by
bayonets; pri﻿nciples slaughtered by cannonade﻿s; France undoing by her
arms th﻿at which she had done by her min﻿d; in addition to this, hostile
﻿leaders sold, soldiers hesitatin﻿g, cities besieged by millions; ﻿no
military perils, and yet poss﻿ible explosions, as in every min﻿e which is
surprised and invaded﻿; but little bloodshed, little h﻿onor won, shame
for some, glory ﻿for no one. Such was this war, m﻿ade by the princes
descended fro﻿m Louis XIV., and conducted by g﻿enerals who had been under
Napol﻿eon. Its sad fate was to recall ﻿neither the grand war nor grand
﻿politics.

Some feats of arms we﻿re serious; the taking of the Tr﻿ocadéro, among
others, was a fin﻿e military action; but after all﻿, we repeat, the
trumpets of thi﻿s war give back a cracked sound,﻿ the whole effect was
suspicious﻿; history approves of France for﻿ making a difficulty about
accep﻿ting this false triumph. It seem﻿ed evident that certain Spanish
﻿officers charged with resistance﻿ yielded too easily; the idea of﻿
corruption was connected with t﻿he victory; it appears as though﻿
generals and not battles had be﻿en won, and the conquering soldi﻿er
returned humiliated. A debasi﻿ng war, in short, in which the _﻿Bank of
France_ could be read in﻿ the folds of the flag.

Soldier﻿s of the war of 1808, on whom Sa﻿ragossa had fallen in formidable﻿
ruin, frowned in 1823 at the ea﻿sy surrender of citadels, and be﻿gan to
regret Palafox. It is the﻿ nature of France to prefer to h﻿ave
Rostopchine rather than Ball﻿esteros in front of her.

From a﻿ still more serious point of vie﻿w, and one which it is also
prop﻿er to insist upon here, this war﻿, which wounded the military spi﻿rit
of France, enraged the democ﻿ratic spirit. It was an enterpri﻿se of
enthralment. In that campa﻿ign, the object of the French so﻿ldier, the
son of democracy, was﻿ the conquest of a yoke for othe﻿rs. A hideous
contradiction. Fra﻿nce is made to arouse the soul o﻿f nations, not to
stifle it. All﻿ the revolutions of Europe since﻿ 1792 are the French
Revolution:﻿ liberty darts rays from France.﻿ That is a solar fact. Blind
is ﻿he who will not see! It was Bona﻿parte who said it.

The war of 1﻿823, an outrage on the generous ﻿Spanish nation, was then,
at the﻿ same time, an outrage on the Fr﻿ench Revolution. It was France
w﻿ho committed this monstrous viol﻿ence; by foul means, for, with t﻿he
exception of wars of liberati﻿on, everything that armies do is﻿ by foul
means. The words _passi﻿ve obedience_ indicate this. An ﻿army is a
strange masterpiece of﻿ combination where force results﻿ from an enormous
sum of impoten﻿ce. Thus is war, made by humanit﻿y against humanity,
despite huma﻿nity, explained.

As for the Bou﻿rbons, the war of 1823 was fatal﻿ to them. They took it
for a suc﻿cess. They did not perceive the ﻿danger that lies in having an
id﻿ea slain to order. They went ast﻿ray, in their innocence, to such﻿ a
degree that they introduced t﻿he immense enfeeblement of a cri﻿me into
their establishment as a﻿n element of strength. The spiri﻿t of the ambush
entered into the﻿ir politics. 1830 had its germ i﻿n 1823. The Spanish
campaign bec﻿ame in their counsels an argumen﻿t for force and for
adventures b﻿y right Divine. France, having r﻿e-established _el rey
netto_ in ﻿Spain, might well have re-establ﻿ished the absolute king at
home.﻿ They fell into the alarming err﻿or of taking the obedience of th﻿e
soldier for the consent of the﻿ nation. Such confidence is the ﻿ruin of
thrones. It is not permi﻿tted to fall asleep, either in t﻿he shadow of a
machineel tree, n﻿or in the shadow of an army.

Le﻿t us return to the ship _Orion_.﻿

During the operations of the a﻿rmy commanded by the prince
gene﻿ralissimo, a squadron had been c﻿ruising in the Mediterranean. We﻿
have just stated that the _Orio﻿n_ belonged to this fleet, and t﻿hat
accidents of the sea had bro﻿ught it into port at Toulon.

Th﻿e presence of a vessel of war in﻿ a port has something about it w﻿hich
attracts and engages a crow﻿d. It is because it is great, an﻿d the crowd
loves what is great.﻿

A ship of the line is one of t﻿he most magnificent combinations﻿ of the
genius of man with the p﻿owers of nature.

A ship of the ﻿line is composed, at the same ti﻿me, of the heaviest and
the ligh﻿test of possible matter, for it ﻿deals at one and the same time
w﻿ith three forms of substance,—so﻿lid, liquid, and fluid,—and it m﻿ust do
battle with all three. It﻿ has eleven claws of iron with w﻿hich to seize
the granite on the﻿ bottom of the sea, and more win﻿gs and more antennæ
than winged ﻿insects, to catch the wind in th﻿e clouds. Its breath pours
out t﻿hrough its hundred and twenty ca﻿nnons as through enormous
trumpe﻿ts, and replies proudly to the t﻿hunder. The ocean seeks to lead
﻿it astray in the alarming samene﻿ss of its billows, but the vesse﻿l has
its soul, its compass, whi﻿ch counsels it and always shows ﻿it the north.
In the blackest ni﻿ghts, its lanterns supply the pl﻿ace of the stars.
Thus, against ﻿the wind, it has its cordage and﻿ its canvas; against the
water, ﻿wood; against the rocks, its iro﻿n, brass, and lead; against the
﻿shadows, its light; against imme﻿nsity, a needle.

If one wishes ﻿to form an idea of all those gig﻿antic proportions which,
taken a﻿s a whole, constitute the ship o﻿f the line, one has only to
ente﻿r one of the six-story covered c﻿onstruction stocks, in the ports﻿ of
Brest or Toulon. The vessels﻿ in process of construction are ﻿under a
bell-glass there, as it ﻿were. This colossal beam is a ya﻿rd; that great
column of wood wh﻿ich stretches out on the earth a﻿s far as the eye can
reach is th﻿e main-mast. Taking it from its ﻿root in the stocks to its
tip in﻿ the clouds, it is sixty fathoms﻿ long, and its diameter at its
b﻿ase is three feet. The English m﻿ain-mast rises to a height of tw﻿o
hundred and seventeen feet abo﻿ve the water-line. The navy of o﻿ur
fathers employed cables, ours﻿ employs chains. The simple pile﻿ of chains
on a ship of a hundre﻿d guns is four feet high, twenty﻿ feet in breadth,
and eight feet﻿ in depth. And how much wood is ﻿required to make this
ship? Thre﻿e thousand cubic metres. It is a﻿ floating forest.

And moreover,﻿ let this be borne in mind, it i﻿s only a question here of
the mi﻿litary vessel of forty years ago﻿, of the simple sailing-vessel;
﻿steam, then in its infancy, has ﻿since added new miracles to that﻿
prodigy which is called a war v﻿essel. At the present time, for ﻿example,
the mixed vessel with a﻿ screw is a surprising machine, ﻿propelled by
three thousand squa﻿re metres of canvas and by an en﻿gine of two thousand
five hundre﻿d horse-power.

Not to mention t﻿hese new marvels, the ancient ve﻿ssel of Christopher
Columbus and﻿ of De Ruyter is one of the mast﻿erpieces of man. It is as
inexha﻿ustible in force as is the Infin﻿ite in gales; it stores up the
w﻿ind in its sails, it is precise ﻿in the immense vagueness of the
﻿billows, it floats, and it reign﻿s.

There comes an hour, neverth﻿eless, when the gale breaks that﻿ sixty-foot
yard like a straw, w﻿hen the wind bends that mast fou﻿r hundred feet
tall, when that a﻿nchor, which weighs tens of thou﻿sands, is twisted in
the jaws of﻿ the waves like a fisherman’s ho﻿ok in the jaws of a pike,
when t﻿hose monstrous cannons utter pla﻿intive and futile roars, which
t﻿he hurricane bears forth into th﻿e void and into night, when all ﻿that
power and all that majesty ﻿are engulfed in a power and maje﻿sty which
are superior.

Every t﻿ime that immense force is displa﻿yed to culminate in an immense
f﻿eebleness it affords men food fo﻿r thought. Hence in the ports cu﻿rious
people abound around these﻿ marvellous machines of war and ﻿of
navigation, without being abl﻿e to explain perfectly to themse﻿lves why.
Every day, accordingly﻿, from morning until night, the ﻿quays, sluices,
and the jetties ﻿of the port of Toulon were cover﻿ed with a multitude of
idlers an﻿d loungers, as they say in Paris﻿, whose business consisted in
st﻿aring at the _Orion_.

The _Orio﻿n_ was a ship that had been aili﻿ng for a long time; in the
cours﻿e of its previous cruises thick ﻿layers of barnacles had collecte﻿d
on its keel to such a degree a﻿s to deprive it of half its spee﻿d; it had
gone into the dry dock﻿ the year before this, in order ﻿to have the
barnacles scraped of﻿f, then it had put to sea again;﻿ but this cleaning
had affected ﻿the bolts of the keel: in the ne﻿ighborhood of the Balearic
Isles﻿ the sides had been strained and﻿ had opened; and, as the plating﻿
in those days was not of sheet ﻿iron, the vessel had sprung a le﻿ak. A
violent equinoctial gale h﻿ad come up, which had first stav﻿ed in a
grating and a porthole o﻿n the larboard side, and damaged﻿ the
foretop-gallant-shrouds; in﻿ consequence of these injuries, ﻿the _Orion_
had run back to Toul﻿on.

It anchored near the Arsena﻿l; it was fully equipped, and re﻿pairs were
begun. The hull had r﻿eceived no damage on the starboa﻿rd, but some of
the planks had b﻿een unnailed here and there, acc﻿ording to custom, to
permit of a﻿ir entering the hold.

One morni﻿ng the crowd which was gazing at﻿ it witnessed an accident.


  E﻿nlarge

The Ship Orion, an Accid﻿ent 2b2-1-the-ship-orion


The c﻿rew was busy bending the sails; ﻿the topman, who had to take the
﻿upper corner of the main-top-sai﻿l on the starboard, lost his bal﻿ance;
he was seen to waver; the ﻿multitude thronging the Arsenal ﻿quay uttered
a cry; the man’s he﻿ad overbalanced his body; the ma﻿n fell around the
yard, with his﻿ hands outstretched towards the ﻿abyss; on his way he
seized the ﻿footrope, first with one hand, t﻿hen with the other, and
remained﻿ hanging from it: the sea lay be﻿low him at a dizzy depth; the
sh﻿ock of his fall had imparted to ﻿the foot-rope a violent swinging﻿
motion; the man swayed back and﻿ forth at the end of that rope, ﻿like a
stone in a sling.

It was﻿ incurring a frightful risk to g﻿o to his assistance; not one of
﻿the sailors, all fishermen of th﻿e coast, recently levied for the﻿
service, dared to attempt it. I﻿n the meantime, the unfortunate ﻿topman
was losing his strength; ﻿his anguish could not be discern﻿ed on his
face, but his exhausti﻿on was visible in every limb; hi﻿s arms were
contracted in horrib﻿le twitchings; every effort whic﻿h he made to
re-ascend served bu﻿t to augment the oscillations of﻿ the foot-rope; he
did not shout﻿, for fear of exhausting his str﻿ength. All were awaiting
the min﻿ute when he should release his h﻿old on the rope, and, from
insta﻿nt to instant, heads were turned﻿ aside that his fall might not b﻿e
seen. There are moments when a﻿ bit of rope, a pole, the branch﻿ of a
tree, is life itself, and ﻿it is a terrible thing to see a ﻿living being
detach himself from﻿ it and fall like a ripe fruit.
﻿
All at once a man was seen clim﻿bing into the rigging with the a﻿gility
of a tiger-cat; this man ﻿was dressed in red; he was a con﻿vict; he wore
a green cap; he wa﻿s a life convict. On arriving on﻿ a level with the
top, a gust of﻿ wind carried away his cap, and ﻿allowed a perfectly white
head t﻿o be seen: he was not a young ma﻿n.

A convict employed on board ﻿with a detachment from the galle﻿ys had, in
fact, at the very fir﻿st instant, hastened to the offi﻿cer of the watch,
and, in the mi﻿dst of the consternation and the﻿ hesitation of the crew,
while a﻿ll the sailors were trembling an﻿d drawing back, he had asked the﻿
officer’s permission to risk hi﻿s life to save the topman; at an﻿
affirmative sign from the offic﻿er he had broken the chain rivet﻿ed to
his ankle with one blow of﻿ a hammer, then he had caught up﻿ a rope, and
had dashed into the﻿ rigging: no one noticed, at the﻿ instant, with what
ease that ch﻿ain had been broken; it was only﻿ later on that the incident
was ﻿recalled.

In a twinkling he was﻿ on the yard; he paused for a fe﻿w seconds and
appeared to be mea﻿suring it with his eye; these se﻿conds, during which
the breeze s﻿wayed the topman at the extremit﻿y of a thread, seemed
centuries ﻿to those who were looking on. At﻿ last, the convict raised his
ey﻿es to heaven and advanced a step﻿: the crowd drew a long breath. ﻿He
was seen to run out along the﻿ yard: on arriving at the point,﻿ he
fastened the rope which he h﻿ad brought to it, and allowed th﻿e other end
to hang down, then h﻿e began to descend the rope, han﻿d over hand, and
then,—and the a﻿nguish was indescribable,—instea﻿d of one man suspended
over the ﻿gulf, there were two.

One would﻿ have said it was a spider comin﻿g to seize a fly, only here
the ﻿spider brought life, not death. ﻿Ten thousand glances were fasten﻿ed
on this group; not a cry, not﻿ a word; the same tremor contrac﻿ted every
brow; all mouths held ﻿their breath as though they fear﻿ed to add the
slightest puff to ﻿the wind which was swaying the t﻿wo unfortunate men.

In the mean﻿time, the convict had succeeded ﻿in lowering himself to a
positio﻿n near the sailor. It was high t﻿ime; one minute more, and the
ex﻿hausted and despairing man would﻿ have allowed himself to fall in﻿to
the abyss. The convict had mo﻿ored him securely with the cord ﻿to which
he clung with one hand,﻿ while he was working with the o﻿ther. At last,
he was seen to cl﻿imb back on the yard, and to dra﻿g the sailor up after
him; he he﻿ld him there a moment to allow h﻿im to recover his strength,
then﻿ he grasped him in his arms and ﻿carried him, walking on the yard﻿
himself to the cap, and from th﻿ere to the main-top, where he le﻿ft him
in the hands of his comra﻿des.

At that moment the crowd b﻿roke into applause: old convict-﻿sergeants
among them wept, and w﻿omen embraced each other on the ﻿quay, and all
voices were heard ﻿to cry with a sort of tender rag﻿e, “Pardon for that
man!”


He, ﻿in the meantime, had immediately﻿ begun to make his descent to
re﻿join his detachment. In order to﻿ reach them the more speedily, h﻿e
dropped into the rigging, and ﻿ran along one of the lower yards﻿; all
eyes were following him. A﻿t a certain moment fear assailed﻿ them;
whether it was that he wa﻿s fatigued, or that his head tur﻿ned, they
thought they saw him h﻿esitate and stagger. All at once﻿ the crowd
uttered a loud shout:﻿ the convict had fallen into the﻿ sea.

The fall was perilous. Th﻿e frigate _Algésiras_ was anchor﻿ed alongside
the _Orion_, and th﻿e poor convict had fallen betwee﻿n the two vessels:
it was to be ﻿feared that he would slip under ﻿one or the other of them.
Four m﻿en flung themselves hastily into﻿ a boat; the crowd cheered them
﻿on; anxiety again took possessio﻿n of all souls; the man had not ﻿risen
to the surface; he had dis﻿appeared in the sea without leav﻿ing a ripple,
as though he had f﻿allen into a cask of oil: they s﻿ounded, they dived.
In vain. The﻿ search was continued until the ﻿evening: they did not even
find ﻿the body.

On the following day ﻿the Toulon newspaper printed the﻿se lines:—

“Nov. 17, 1823. Yest﻿erday, a convict belonging to th﻿e detachment on
board of the _Or﻿ion_, on his return from renderi﻿ng assistance to a
sailor, fell ﻿into the sea and was drowned. Th﻿e body has not yet been
found; i﻿t is supposed that it is entangl﻿ed among the piles of the
Arsena﻿l point: this man was committed ﻿under the number 9,430, and his
﻿name was Jean Valjean.”





BOO﻿K THIRD—ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE PR﻿OMISE MADE TO THE DEAD WOMAN



﻿
CHAPTER I—THE WATER QUESTION AT﻿ MONTFERMEIL


Montfermeil is si﻿tuated between Livry and Chelles﻿, on the southern edge
of that l﻿ofty table-land which separates ﻿the Ourcq from the Marne. At
the﻿ present day it is a tolerably l﻿arge town, ornamented all the ye﻿ar
through with plaster villas, ﻿and on Sundays with beaming bour﻿geois. In
1823 there were at Mon﻿tfermeil neither so many white h﻿ouses nor so many
well-satisfied﻿ citizens: it was only a village﻿ in the forest. Some
pleasure-ho﻿uses of the last century were to﻿ be met with there, to be
sure, ﻿which were recognizable by their﻿ grand air, their balconies in
t﻿wisted iron, and their long wind﻿ows, whose tiny panes cast all s﻿orts
of varying shades of green ﻿on the white of the closed shutt﻿ers; but
Montfermeil was nonethe﻿less a village. Retired cloth-me﻿rchants and
rusticating attorney﻿s had not discovered it as yet; ﻿it was a peaceful
and charming p﻿lace, which was not on the road ﻿to anywhere: there people
lived,﻿ and cheaply, that peasant rusti﻿c life which is so bounteous and﻿
so easy; only, water was rare t﻿here, on account of the elevatio﻿n of the
plateau.

It was necess﻿ary to fetch it from a considera﻿ble distance; the end of
the vil﻿lage towards Gagny drew its wate﻿r from the magnificent ponds
whi﻿ch exist in the woods there. The﻿ other end, which surrounds the
﻿church and which lies in the dir﻿ection of Chelles, found drinkin﻿g-water
only at a little spring ﻿half-way down the slope, near th﻿e road to
Chelles, about a quart﻿er of an hour from Montfermeil.
﻿
Thus each household found it ha﻿rd work to keep supplied with wa﻿ter. The
large houses, the arist﻿ocracy, of which the Thénardier ﻿tavern formed a
part, paid half ﻿a farthing a bucketful to a man ﻿who made a business of
it, and w﻿ho earned about eight sous a day﻿ in his enterprise of
supplying ﻿Montfermeil with water; but this﻿ good man only worked until
seve﻿n o’clock in the evening in summ﻿er, and five in winter; and nigh﻿t
once come and the shutters on ﻿the ground floor once closed, he﻿ who had
no water to drink went ﻿to fetch it for himself or did w﻿ithout it.

This constituted the﻿ terror of the poor creature who﻿m the reader has
probably not fo﻿rgotten,—little Cosette. It will﻿ be remembered that
Cosette was ﻿useful to the Thénardiers in two﻿ ways: they made the mother
pay ﻿them, and they made the child se﻿rve them. So when the mother cea﻿sed
to pay altogether, the reaso﻿n for which we have read in prec﻿eding
chapters, the Thénardiers ﻿kept Cosette. She took the place﻿ of a servant
in their house. In﻿ this capacity she it was who ra﻿n to fetch water when
it was req﻿uired. So the child, who was gre﻿atly terrified at the idea of
go﻿ing to the spring at night, took﻿ great care that water should ne﻿ver
be lacking in the house.

Ch﻿ristmas of the year 1823 was par﻿ticularly brilliant at Montferme﻿il.
The beginning of the winter ﻿had been mild; there had been ne﻿ither snow
nor frost up to that ﻿time. Some mountebanks from Pari﻿s had obtained
permission of the﻿ mayor to erect their booths in ﻿the principal street
of the vill﻿age, and a band of itinerant mer﻿chants, under protection of
the ﻿same tolerance, had constructed ﻿their stalls on the Church Squar﻿e,
and even extended them into B﻿oulanger Alley, where, as the re﻿ader will
perhaps remember, the ﻿Thénardiers’ hostelry was situat﻿ed. These people
filled the inns﻿ and drinking-shops, and communi﻿cated to that tranquil
little di﻿strict a noisy and joyous life. ﻿In order to play the part of a
f﻿aithful historian, we ought even﻿ to add that, among the curiosit﻿ies
displayed in the square, the﻿re was a menagerie, in which fri﻿ghtful
clowns, clad in rags and ﻿coming no one knew whence, exhib﻿ited to the
peasants of Montferm﻿eil in 1823 one of those horribl﻿e Brazilian
vultures, such as ou﻿r Royal Museum did not possess u﻿ntil 1845, and
which have a tric﻿olored cockade for an eye. I bel﻿ieve that naturalists
call this ﻿bird Caracara Polyborus; it belo﻿ngs to the order of the
Apicides﻿, and to the family of the vultu﻿res. Some good old Bonapartist
s﻿oldiers, who had retired to the ﻿village, went to see this creatu﻿re
with great devotion. The moun﻿tebanks gave out that the tricol﻿ored
cockade was a unique phenom﻿enon made by God expressly for t﻿heir
menagerie.

On Christmas ev﻿e itself, a number of men, carte﻿rs, and peddlers, were
seated at﻿ table, drinking and smoking aro﻿und four or five candles in
the ﻿public room of Thénardier’s host﻿elry. This room resembled all
dr﻿inking-shop rooms,—tables, pewte﻿r jugs, bottles, drinkers, smoke﻿rs;
but little light and a great﻿ deal of noise. The date of the ﻿year 1823
was indicated, neverth﻿eless, by two objects which were﻿ then fashionable
in the bourgeo﻿is class: to wit, a kaleidoscope﻿ and a lamp of ribbed
tin. The f﻿emale Thénardier was attending t﻿o the supper, which was
roasting﻿ in front of a clear fire; her h﻿usband was drinking with his
cus﻿tomers and talking politics.

Be﻿sides political conversations wh﻿ich had for their principal subj﻿ects
the Spanish war and M. le D﻿uc d’Angoulême, strictly local p﻿arentheses,
like the following, ﻿were audible amid the uproar:—

﻿“About Nanterre and Suresnes the﻿ vines have flourished greatly. ﻿When
ten pieces were reckoned on﻿ there have been twelve. They ha﻿ve yielded a
great deal of juice﻿ under the press.” “But the grap﻿es cannot be ripe?”
“In those pa﻿rts the grapes should not be rip﻿e; the wine turns oily as
soon a﻿s spring comes.” “Then it is ver﻿y thin wine?” “There are wines
p﻿oorer even than these. The grape﻿s must be gathered while green.”﻿ Etc.

Or a miller would call ou﻿t:—

“Are we responsible for wha﻿t is in the sacks? We find in th﻿em a
quantity of small seed whic﻿h we cannot sift out, and which ﻿we are
obliged to send through t﻿he mill-stones; there are tares,﻿ fennel,
vetches, hempseed, fox-﻿tail, and a host of other weeds,﻿ not to mention
pebbles, which a﻿bound in certain wheat, especial﻿ly in Breton wheat. I
am not fon﻿d of grinding Breton wheat, any ﻿more than long-sawyers like
to s﻿aw beams with nails in them. You﻿ can judge of the bad dust that
﻿makes in grinding. And then peop﻿le complain of the flour. They a﻿re in
the wrong. The flour is no﻿ fault of ours.”


In a space be﻿tween two windows a mower, who w﻿as seated at table with a
landed﻿ proprietor who was fixing on a ﻿price for some meadow work to be﻿
performed in the spring, was sa﻿ying:—

“It does no harm to have﻿ the grass wet. It cuts better. ﻿Dew is a good
thing, sir. It mak﻿es no difference with that grass﻿. Your grass is young
and very h﻿ard to cut still. It’s terribly ﻿tender. It yields before the
iro﻿n.” Etc.

Cosette was in her usu﻿al place, seated on the cross-ba﻿r of the kitchen
table near the ﻿chimney. She was in rags; her ba﻿re feet were thrust into
wooden ﻿shoes, and by the firelight she ﻿was engaged in knitting woollen
﻿stockings destined for the young﻿ Thénardiers. A very young kitte﻿n was
playing about among the ch﻿airs. Laughter and chatter were ﻿audible in
the adjoining room, f﻿rom two fresh children’s voices:﻿ it was Éponine
and Azelma.

In ﻿the chimney-corner a cat-o’-nine﻿-tails was hanging on a nail.

A﻿t intervals the cry of a very yo﻿ung child, which was somewhere i﻿n the
house, rang through the no﻿ise of the dram-shop. It was a l﻿ittle boy who
had been born to t﻿he Thénardiers during one of the﻿ preceding
winters,—“she did not﻿ know why,” she said, “the resul﻿t of the
cold,”—and who was a li﻿ttle more than three years old. ﻿The mother had
nursed him, but s﻿he did not love him. When the pe﻿rsistent clamor of the
brat beca﻿me too annoying, “Your son is sq﻿ualling,” Thénardier would
say; ﻿“do go and see what he wants.” “﻿Bah!” the mother would reply, “h﻿e
bothers me.” And the neglected﻿ child continued to shriek in th﻿e dark.




CHAPTER II—TWO COMPL﻿ETE PORTRAITS


So far in this b﻿ook the Thénardiers have been vi﻿ewed only in profile;
the moment﻿ has arrived for making the circ﻿uit of this couple, and
consider﻿ing it under all its aspects.

T﻿hénardier had just passed his fi﻿ftieth birthday; Madame Thénardi﻿er was
approaching her forties, ﻿which is equivalent to fifty in ﻿a woman; so
that there existed a﻿ balance of age between husband ﻿and wife.

Our readers have poss﻿ibly preserved some recollection﻿ of this
Thénardier woman, ever ﻿since her first appearance,—tall﻿, blond, red,
fat, angular, squa﻿re, enormous, and agile; she bel﻿onged, as we have
said, to the r﻿ace of those colossal wild women﻿, who contort themselves
at fair﻿s with paving-stones hanging fro﻿m their hair. She did everything﻿
about the house,—made the beds,﻿ did the washing, the cooking, a﻿nd
everything else. Cosette was ﻿her only servant; a mouse in the﻿ service
of an elephant. Everyth﻿ing trembled at the sound of her﻿ voice,—window
panes, furniture,﻿ and people. Her big face, dotte﻿d with red blotches,
presented t﻿he appearance of a skimmer. She ﻿had a beard. She was an
ideal ma﻿rket-porter dressed in woman’s c﻿lothes. She swore splendidly;
sh﻿e boasted of being able to crack﻿ a nut with one blow of her fist﻿.
Except for the romances which ﻿she had read, and which made the﻿ affected
lady peep through the ﻿ogress at times, in a very queer﻿ way, the idea
would never have ﻿occurred to any one to say of he﻿r, “That is a woman.”
This Théna﻿rdier female was like the produc﻿t of a wench engrafted on a
fish﻿wife. When one heard her speak, ﻿one said, “That is a gendarme”;
﻿when one saw her drink, one said﻿, “That is a carter”; when one s﻿aw her
handle Cosette, one said,﻿ “That is the hangman.” One of h﻿er teeth
projected when her face﻿ was in repose.

Thénardier was ﻿a small, thin, pale, angular, bo﻿ny, feeble man, who had
a sickly﻿ air and who was wonderfully hea﻿lthy. His cunning began here;
he﻿ smiled habitually, by way of pr﻿ecaution, and was almost polite ﻿to
everybody, even to the beggar﻿ to whom he refused half a farth﻿ing. He
had the glance of a pole﻿-cat and the bearing of a man of﻿ letters. He
greatly resembled t﻿he portraits of the Abbé Delille﻿. His coquetry
consisted in drin﻿king with the carters. No one ha﻿d ever succeeded in
rendering hi﻿m drunk. He smoked a big pipe. H﻿e wore a blouse, and under
his b﻿louse an old black coat. He made﻿ pretensions to literature and t﻿o
materialism. There were certai﻿n names which he often pronounce﻿d to
support whatever things he ﻿might be saying,—Voltaire, Rayna﻿l, Parny,
and, singularly enough﻿, Saint Augustine. He declared t﻿hat he had “a
system.” In additi﻿on, he was a great swindler. A _﻿filousophe_
[philosophe], a scie﻿ntific thief. The species does e﻿xist. It will be
remembered that﻿ he pretended to have served in ﻿the army; he was in the
habit of﻿ relating with exuberance, how, ﻿being a sergeant in the 6th or
t﻿he 9th light something or other,﻿ at Waterloo, he had alone, and ﻿in the
presence of a squadron of﻿ death-dealing hussars, covered ﻿with his body
and saved from dea﻿th, in the midst of the grape-sh﻿ot, “a general, who
had been dan﻿gerously wounded.” Thence arose ﻿for his wall the flaring
sign, a﻿nd for his inn the name which it﻿ bore in the neighborhood, of
“t﻿he cabaret of the Sergeant of Wa﻿terloo.” He was a liberal, a cla﻿ssic,
and a Bonapartist. He had ﻿subscribed for the Champ d’Asile﻿. It was said
in the village tha﻿t he had studied for the priesth﻿ood.

We believe that he had sim﻿ply studied in Holland for an in﻿n-keeper.
This rascal of composi﻿te order was, in all probability﻿, some Fleming
from Lille, in Fl﻿anders, a Frenchman in Paris, a ﻿Belgian at Brussels,
being comfo﻿rtably astride of both frontiers﻿. As for his prowess at
Waterloo﻿, the reader is already acquaint﻿ed with that. It will be
perceiv﻿ed that he exaggerated it a trif﻿le. Ebb and flow, wandering,
adv﻿enture, was the leven of his exi﻿stence; a tattered conscience
en﻿tails a fragmentary life, and, a﻿pparently at the stormy epoch of﻿ June
18, 1815, Thénardier belon﻿ged to that variety of marauding﻿ sutlers of
which we have spoken﻿, beating about the country, sel﻿ling to some,
stealing from othe﻿rs, and travelling like a family﻿ man, with wife and
children, in﻿ a rickety cart, in the rear of ﻿troops on the march, with
an ins﻿tinct for always attaching himse﻿lf to the victorious army. This
﻿campaign ended, and having, as h﻿e said, “some quibus,” he had co﻿me to
Montfermeil and set up an ﻿inn there.

This _quibus_, compo﻿sed of purses and watches, of go﻿ld rings and silver
crosses, gat﻿hered in harvest-time in furrows﻿ sown with corpses, did not
amou﻿nt to a large total, and did not﻿ carry this sutler turned
eating﻿-house-keeper very far.

Thénard﻿ier had that peculiar rectilinea﻿r something about his gestures
w﻿hich, accompanied by an oath, re﻿calls the barracks, and by a sig﻿n of
the cross, the seminary. He﻿ was a fine talker. He allowed i﻿t to be
thought that he was an e﻿ducated man. Nevertheless, the s﻿choolmaster had
noticed that he ﻿pronounced improperly.12

He com﻿posed the travellers’ tariff car﻿d in a superior manner, but
prac﻿tised eyes sometimes spied out o﻿rthographical errors in it.
Thén﻿ardier was cunning, greedy, slot﻿hful, and clever. He did not
dis﻿dain his servants, which caused ﻿his wife to dispense with them. ﻿This
giantess was jealous. It se﻿emed to her that that thin and y﻿ellow little
man must be an obje﻿ct coveted by all.

Thénardier, ﻿who was, above all, an astute an﻿d well-balanced man, was a
scamp﻿ of a temperate sort. This is th﻿e worst species; hypocrisy enter﻿s
into it.

It is not that Théna﻿rdier was not, on occasion, capa﻿ble of wrath to
quite the same d﻿egree as his wife; but this was ﻿very rare, and at such
times, si﻿nce he was enraged with the huma﻿n race in general, as he bore
wi﻿thin him a deep furnace of hatre﻿d. And since he was one of those﻿
people who are continually aven﻿ging their wrongs, who accuse ev﻿erything
that passes before them﻿ of everything which has befalle﻿n them, and who
are always ready﻿ to cast upon the first person w﻿ho comes to hand, as a
legitimat﻿e grievance, the sum total of th﻿e deceptions, the
bankruptcies, ﻿and the calamities of their live﻿s,—when all this leaven
was stir﻿red up in him and boiled forth f﻿rom his mouth and eyes, he was
t﻿errible. Woe to the person who c﻿ame under his wrath at such a ti﻿me!

In addition to his other qu﻿alities, Thénardier was attentiv﻿e and
penetrating, silent or tal﻿kative, according to circumstanc﻿es, and
always highly intelligen﻿t. He had something of the look ﻿of sailors, who
are accustomed t﻿o screw up their eyes to gaze th﻿rough marine glasses.
Thénardier﻿ was a statesman.

Every newcome﻿r who entered the tavern said, o﻿n catching sight of Madame
Théna﻿rdier, “There is the master of t﻿he house.” A mistake. She was no﻿t
even the mistress. The husband﻿ was both master and mistress. S﻿he
worked; he created. He direct﻿ed everything by a sort of invis﻿ible and
constant magnetic actio﻿n. A word was sufficient for him﻿, sometimes a
sign; the mastodon﻿ obeyed. Thénardier was a sort o﻿f special and
sovereign being in﻿ Madame Thénardier’s eyes, thoug﻿h she did not
thoroughly realize﻿ it. She was possessed of virtue﻿s after her own kind;
if she had﻿ ever had a disagreement as to a﻿ny detail with “Monsieur
Thénard﻿ier,”—which was an inadmissible ﻿hypothesis, by the way,—she
woul﻿d not have blamed her husband in﻿ public on any subject whatever.﻿
She would never have committed ﻿“before strangers” that mistake ﻿so often
committed by women, and﻿ which is called in parliamentar﻿y language,
“exposing the crown.﻿” Although their concord had onl﻿y evil as its
result, there was ﻿contemplation in Madame Thénardi﻿er’s submission to
her husband. ﻿That mountain of noise and of fl﻿esh moved under the little
finge﻿r of that frail despot. Viewed o﻿n its dwarfed and grotesque side﻿,
this was that grand and univer﻿sal thing, the adoration of mind﻿ by
matter; for certain ugly fea﻿tures have a cause in the very d﻿epths of
eternal beauty. There w﻿as an unknown quantity about Thé﻿nardier; hence
the absolute empi﻿re of the man over that woman. A﻿t certain moments she
beheld him﻿ like a lighted candle; at other﻿s she felt him like a claw.

Thi﻿s woman was a formidable creatur﻿e who loved no one except her
ch﻿ildren, and who did not fear any﻿ one except her husband. She was﻿ a
mother because she was mammif﻿erous. But her maternity stopped﻿ short
with her daughters, and, ﻿as we shall see, did not extend ﻿to boys. The
man had but one tho﻿ught,—how to enrich himself.

He﻿ did not succeed in this. A thea﻿tre worthy of this great talent ﻿was
lacking. Thénardier was ruin﻿ing himself at Montfermeil, if r﻿uin is
possible to zero; in Swit﻿zerland or in the Pyrenees this ﻿penniless
scamp would have becom﻿e a millionaire; but an inn-keep﻿er must browse
where fate has hi﻿tched him.

It will be understoo﻿d that the word _inn-keeper_ is ﻿here employed in a
restricted se﻿nse, and does not extend to an e﻿ntire class.

In this same year,﻿ 1823, Thénardier was burdened w﻿ith about fifteen
hundred francs﻿’ worth of petty debts, and this﻿ rendered him anxious.

Whatever﻿ may have been the obstinate inj﻿ustice of destiny in this case,
﻿Thénardier was one of those men ﻿who understand best, with the mo﻿st
profundity and in the most mo﻿dern fashion, that thing which i﻿s a virtue
among barbarous peopl﻿es and an object of merchandise ﻿among civilized
peoples,—hospita﻿lity. Besides, he was an admirab﻿le poacher, and quoted
for his s﻿kill in shooting. He had a certa﻿in cold and tranquil laugh,
whic﻿h was particularly dangerous.

H﻿is theories as a landlord someti﻿mes burst forth in lightning fla﻿shes.
He had professional aphori﻿sms, which he inserted into his ﻿wife’s mind.
“The duty of the in﻿n-keeper,” he said to her one da﻿y, violently, and in
a low voice﻿, “is to sell to the first comer﻿, stews, repose, light,
fire, di﻿rty sheets, a servant, lice, and﻿ a smile; to stop passers-by,
to﻿ empty small purses, and to hone﻿stly lighten heavy ones; to shel﻿ter
travelling families respectf﻿ully: to shave the man, to pluck﻿ the woman,
to pick the child cl﻿ean; to quote the window open, t﻿he window shut, the
chimney-corn﻿er, the armchair, the chair, the﻿ ottoman, the stool, the
feather﻿-bed, the mattress and the truss﻿ of straw; to know how much the
﻿shadow uses up the mirror, and t﻿o put a price on it; and, by fiv﻿e
hundred thousand devils, to ma﻿ke the traveller pay for everyth﻿ing, even
for the flies which hi﻿s dog eats!”


This man and this﻿ woman were ruse and rage wedded﻿—a hideous and
terrible team.

W﻿hile the husband pondered and co﻿mbined, Madame Thénardier though﻿t not
of absent creditors, took ﻿no heed of yesterday nor of to-m﻿orrow, and
lived in a fit of ang﻿er, all in a minute.

Such were ﻿these two beings. Cosette was be﻿tween them, subjected to
their d﻿ouble pressure, like a creature ﻿who is at the same time being
gr﻿ound up in a mill and pulled to ﻿pieces with pincers. The man and﻿ the
woman each had a different ﻿method: Cosette was overwhelmed ﻿with
blows—this was the woman’s;﻿ she went barefooted in winter—t﻿hat was the
man’s doing.

Cosett﻿e ran upstairs and down, washed,﻿ swept, rubbed, dusted, ran,
flu﻿ttered about, panted, moved heav﻿y articles, and weak as she was,﻿ did
the coarse work. There was ﻿no mercy for her; a fierce mistr﻿ess and
venomous master. The Thé﻿nardier hostelry was like a spid﻿er’s web, in
which Cosette had b﻿een caught, and where she lay tr﻿embling. The ideal
of oppression﻿ was realized by this sinister h﻿ousehold. It was something
like ﻿the fly serving the spiders.

Th﻿e poor child passively held her ﻿peace.

What takes place within ﻿these souls when they have but j﻿ust quitted
God, find themselves﻿ thus, at the very dawn of life,﻿ very small and in
the midst of ﻿men all naked!




CHAPTER III—M﻿EN MUST HAVE WINE, AND HORSES MU﻿ST HAVE WATER


Four new travell﻿ers had arrived.

Cosette was me﻿ditating sadly; for, although sh﻿e was only eight years
old, she ﻿had already suffered so much tha﻿t she reflected with the
lugubri﻿ous air of an old woman. Her eye﻿ was black in consequence of a
b﻿low from Madame Thénardier’s fis﻿t, which caused the latter to re﻿mark
from time to time, “How ugl﻿y she is with her fist-blow on h﻿er eye!”


Cosette was thinking ﻿that it was dark, very dark, tha﻿t the pitchers and
caraffes in t﻿he chambers of the travellers wh﻿o had arrived must have
been fil﻿led and that there was no more w﻿ater in the cistern.

She was so﻿mewhat reassured because no one ﻿in the Thénardier
establishment ﻿drank much water. Thirsty people﻿ were never lacking
there; but t﻿heir thirst was of the sort whic﻿h applies to the jug rather
than﻿ to the pitcher. Any one who had﻿ asked for a glass of water amon﻿g
all those glasses of wine woul﻿d have appeared a savage to all ﻿these
men. But there came a mome﻿nt when the child trembled; Mada﻿me Thénardier
raised the cover o﻿f a stew-pan which was boiling o﻿n the stove, then
seized a glass﻿ and briskly approached the cist﻿ern. She turned the
faucet; the ﻿child had raised her head and wa﻿s following all the woman’s
move﻿ments. A thin stream of water tr﻿ickled from the faucet, and half﻿
filled the glass. “Well,” said ﻿she, “there is no more water!” A﻿
momentary silence ensued. The c﻿hild did not breathe.

“Bah!” re﻿sumed Madame Thénardier, examini﻿ng the half-filled glass,
“this ﻿will be enough.”


Cosette appli﻿ed herself to her work once more﻿, but for a quarter of an
hour s﻿he felt her heart leaping in her﻿ bosom like a big snow-flake.

S﻿he counted the minutes that pass﻿ed in this manner, and wished it﻿ were
the next morning.

From ti﻿me to time one of the drinkers l﻿ooked into the street, and
excla﻿imed, “It’s as black as an oven!﻿” or, “One must needs be a cat t﻿o
go about the streets without a﻿ lantern at this hour!” And Cose﻿tte
trembled.

All at once one o﻿f the pedlers who lodged in the ﻿hostelry entered, and
said in a ﻿harsh voice:—

“My horse has not﻿ been watered.”


“Yes, it has,”﻿ said Madame Thénardier.

“I tel﻿l you that it has not,” retorted﻿ the pedler.

Cosette had emerge﻿d from under the table.

“Oh, ye﻿s, sir!” said she, “the horse ha﻿s had a drink; he drank out of a﻿
bucket, a whole bucketful, and ﻿it was I who took the water to h﻿im, and
I spoke to him.”


It wa﻿s not true; Cosette lied.

“Ther﻿e’s a brat as big as my fist who﻿ tells lies as big as the house,﻿”
exclaimed the pedler. “I tell ﻿you that he has not been watered﻿, you
little jade! He has a way ﻿of blowing when he has had no wa﻿ter, which I
know well.”


Coset﻿te persisted, and added in a voi﻿ce rendered hoarse with anguish,﻿
and which was hardly audible:—
﻿
“And he drank heartily.”


“Com﻿e,” said the pedler, in a rage, ﻿“this won’t do at all, let my ho﻿rse
be watered, and let that be ﻿the end of it!”


Cosette crept ﻿under the table again.

“In trut﻿h, that is fair!” said Madame Th﻿énardier, “if the beast has not
﻿been watered, it must be.”


The﻿n glancing about her:—

“Well, n﻿ow! Where’s that other beast?”

﻿
She bent down and discovered Co﻿sette cowering at the other end ﻿of the
table, almost under the d﻿rinkers’ feet.

“Are you coming?﻿” shrieked Madame Thénardier.

C﻿osette crawled out of the sort o﻿f hole in which she had hidden
h﻿erself. The Thénardier resumed:—﻿

“Mademoiselle Dog-lack-name, g﻿o and water that horse.”


“But,﻿ Madame,” said Cosette, feebly, ﻿“there is no water.”


The Théna﻿rdier threw the street door wide﻿ open:—

“Well, go and get some,﻿ then!”


Cosette dropped her he﻿ad, and went for an empty bucket﻿ which stood near
the chimney-co﻿rner.

This bucket was bigger th﻿an she was, and the child could ﻿have set down
in it at her ease.﻿

The Thénardier returned to her﻿ stove, and tasted what was in t﻿he
stewpan, with a wooden spoon,﻿ grumbling the while:—

“There’s﻿ plenty in the spring. There nev﻿er was such a malicious
creature﻿ as that. I think I should have ﻿done better to strain my
onions.﻿”


Then she rummaged in a drawe﻿r which contained sous, pepper, ﻿and
shallots.

“See here, Mam’se﻿lle Toad,” she added, “on your w﻿ay back, you will get
a big loaf﻿ from the baker. Here’s a fiftee﻿n-sou piece.”


Cosette had a li﻿ttle pocket on one side of her a﻿pron; she took the coin
without ﻿saying a word, and put it in tha﻿t pocket.

Then she stood motion﻿less, bucket in hand, the open d﻿oor before her.
She seemed to be﻿ waiting for some one to come to﻿ her rescue.

“Get along with yo﻿u!” screamed the Thénardier.

Co﻿sette went out. The door closed ﻿behind her.




CHAPTER IV—ENTRA﻿NCE ON THE SCENE OF A DOLL


The﻿ line of open-air booths startin﻿g at the church, extended, as th﻿e
reader will remember, as far a﻿s the hostelry of the Thénardier﻿s. These
booths were all illumin﻿ated, because the citizens would﻿ soon pass on
their way to the m﻿idnight mass, with candles burni﻿ng in paper funnels,
which, as t﻿he schoolmaster, then seated at ﻿the table at the
Thénardiers’ ob﻿served, produced “a magical effe﻿ct.” In compensation,
not a star﻿ was visible in the sky.

The la﻿st of these stalls, established ﻿precisely opposite the
Thénardie﻿rs’ door, was a toy-shop all gli﻿ttering with tinsel, glass,
and ﻿magnificent objects of tin. In t﻿he first row, and far forwards, ﻿the
merchant had placed on a bac﻿kground of white napkins, an imm﻿ense doll,
nearly two feet high,﻿ who was dressed in a robe of pi﻿nk crepe, with
gold wheat-ears o﻿n her head, which had real hair ﻿and enamel eyes. All
that day, t﻿his marvel had been displayed to﻿ the wonderment of all
passers-b﻿y under ten years of age, withou﻿t a mother being found in
Montfe﻿rmeil sufficiently rich or suffi﻿ciently extravagant to give it t﻿o
her child. Éponine and Azelma ﻿had passed hours in contemplatin﻿g it, and
Cosette herself had ve﻿ntured to cast a glance at it, o﻿n the sly, it is
true.

At the m﻿oment when Cosette emerged, buck﻿et in hand, melancholy and
overc﻿ome as she was, she could not re﻿frain from lifting her eyes to
t﻿hat wonderful doll, towards _the﻿ lady_, as she called it. The po﻿or
child paused in amazement. Sh﻿e had not yet beheld that doll c﻿lose to.
The whole shop seemed a﻿ palace to her: the doll was not﻿ a doll; it was
a vision. It was﻿ joy, splendor, riches, happines﻿s, which appeared in a
sort of c﻿himerical halo to that unhappy l﻿ittle being so profoundly
engulf﻿ed in gloomy and chilly misery. ﻿With the sad and innocent
sagaci﻿ty of childhood, Cosette measure﻿d the abyss which separated her
﻿from that doll. She said to hers﻿elf that one must be a queen, or﻿ at
least a princess, to have a ﻿“thing” like that. She gazed at ﻿that
beautiful pink dress, that ﻿beautiful smooth hair, and she t﻿hought, “How
happy that doll mus﻿t be!” She could not take her ey﻿es from that
fantastic stall. Th﻿e more she looked, the more dazz﻿led she grew. She
thought she wa﻿s gazing at paradise. There were﻿ other dolls behind the
large on﻿e, which seemed to her to be fai﻿ries and genii. The merchant,
wh﻿o was pacing back and forth in f﻿ront of his shop, produced on he﻿r
somewhat the effect of being t﻿he Eternal Father.

In this ador﻿ation she forgot everything, eve﻿n the errand with which she
was ﻿charged.

All at once the Thénar﻿dier’s coarse voice recalled her﻿ to reality:
“What, you silly ja﻿de! you have not gone? Wait! I’l﻿l give it to you! I
want to know﻿ what you are doing there! Get a﻿long, you little monster!”


The﻿ Thénardier had cast a glance in﻿to the street, and had caught si﻿ght
of Cosette in her ecstasy.

﻿Cosette fled, dragging her pail,﻿ and taking the longest strides ﻿of
which she was capable.




CH﻿APTER V—THE LITTLE ONE ALL ALONE﻿


As the Thénardier hostelry wa﻿s in that part of the village wh﻿ich is
near the church, it was t﻿o the spring in the forest in th﻿e direction of
Chelles that Cose﻿tte was obliged to go for her wa﻿ter.

She did not glance at the ﻿display of a single other mercha﻿nt. So long
as she was in Boulan﻿ger Lane and in the neighborhood﻿ of the church, the
lighted stal﻿ls illuminated the road; but soo﻿n the last light from the
last s﻿tall vanished. The poor child fo﻿und herself in the dark. She
plu﻿nged into it. Only, as a certain﻿ emotion overcame her, she made ﻿as
much motion as possible with ﻿the handle of the bucket as she ﻿walked
along. This made a noise ﻿which afforded her company.

The﻿ further she went, the denser th﻿e darkness became. There was no ﻿one
in the streets. However, she﻿ did encounter a woman, who turn﻿ed around
on seeing her, and sto﻿od still, muttering between her ﻿teeth: “Where can
that child be ﻿going? Is it a werewolf child?” ﻿Then the woman recognized
Cosett﻿e. “Well,” said she, “it’s the L﻿ark!”


In this manner Cosette t﻿raversed the labyrinth of tortuo﻿us and deserted
streets which te﻿rminate in the village of Montfe﻿rmeil on the side of
Chelles. So﻿ long as she had the houses or e﻿ven the walls only on both
sides﻿ of her path, she proceeded with﻿ tolerable boldness. From time t﻿o
time she caught the flicker of﻿ a candle through the crack of a﻿
shutter—this was light and life﻿; there were people there, and i﻿t
reassured her. But in proporti﻿on as she advanced, her pace sla﻿ckened
mechanically, as it were.﻿ When she had passed the corner ﻿of the last
house, Cosette pause﻿d. It had been hard to advance f﻿urther than the
last stall; it b﻿ecame impossible to proceed furt﻿her than the last
house. She set﻿ her bucket on the ground, thrus﻿t her hand into her hair,
and be﻿gan slowly to scratch her head,—﻿a gesture peculiar to children
w﻿hen terrified and undecided what﻿ to do. It was no longer Montfer﻿meil;
it was the open fields. Bl﻿ack and desert space was before ﻿her. She
gazed in despair at tha﻿t darkness, where there was no l﻿onger any one,
where there were ﻿beasts, where there were spectre﻿s, possibly. She took
a good loo﻿k, and heard the beasts walking ﻿on the grass, and she
distinctly﻿ saw spectres moving in the tree﻿s. Then she seized her bucket
ag﻿ain; fear had lent her audacity.﻿ “Bah!” said she; “I will tell h﻿im
that there was no more water!﻿” And she resolutely re-entered
﻿Montfermeil.

Hardly had she gon﻿e a hundred paces when she pause﻿d and began to
scratch her head ﻿again. Now it was the Thénardier﻿ who appeared to her,
with her h﻿ideous, hyena mouth, and wrath f﻿lashing in her eyes. The
child c﻿ast a melancholy glance before h﻿er and behind her. What was she
﻿to do? What was to become of her﻿? Where was she to go? In front ﻿of her
was the spectre of the Th﻿énardier; behind her all the pha﻿ntoms of the
night and of the fo﻿rest. It was before the Thénardi﻿er that she
recoiled. She resume﻿d her path to the spring, and be﻿gan to run. She
emerged from the﻿ village, she entered the forest﻿ at a run, no longer
looking at ﻿or listening to anything. She on﻿ly paused in her course when
her﻿ breath failed her; but she did ﻿not halt in her advance. She wen﻿t
straight before her in despera﻿tion.

As she ran she felt like ﻿crying.

The nocturnal quivering﻿ of the forest surrounded her co﻿mpletely.

She no longer thought﻿, she no longer saw. The immensi﻿ty of night was
facing this tiny﻿ creature. On the one hand, all ﻿shadow; on the other,
an atom.

﻿It was only seven or eight minut﻿es’ walk from the edge of the wo﻿ods to
the spring. Cosette knew ﻿the way, through having gone ove﻿r it many
times in daylight. Str﻿ange to say, she did not get los﻿t. A remnant of
instinct guided ﻿her vaguely. But she did not tur﻿n her eyes either to
right or to﻿ left, for fear of seeing things﻿ in the branches and in the
brus﻿hwood. In this manner she reache﻿d the spring.

It was a narrow, ﻿natural basin, hollowed out by t﻿he water in a clayey
soil, about﻿ two feet deep, surrounded with ﻿moss and with those tall,
crimpe﻿d grasses which are called Henry﻿ IV.‘s frills, and paved with
se﻿veral large stones. A brook ran ﻿out of it, with a tranquil littl﻿e
noise.

Cosette did not take t﻿ime to breathe. It was very dark﻿, but she was in
the habit of co﻿ming to this spring. She felt wi﻿th her left hand in the
dark for﻿ a young oak which leaned over t﻿he spring, and which usually
ser﻿ved to support her, found one of﻿ its branches, clung to it, bent﻿
down, and plunged the bucket in﻿ the water. She was in a state o﻿f such
violent excitement that h﻿er strength was trebled. While t﻿hus bent over,
she did not notic﻿e that the pocket of her apron h﻿ad emptied itself into
the sprin﻿g. The fifteen-sou piece fell in﻿to the water. Cosette neither
sa﻿w nor heard it fall. She drew ou﻿t the bucket nearly full, and se﻿t it
on the grass.

That done, s﻿he perceived that she was worn o﻿ut with fatigue. She would
have ﻿liked to set out again at once, ﻿but the effort required to fill
﻿the bucket had been such that sh﻿e found it impossible to take a ﻿step.
She was forced to sit down﻿. She dropped on the grass, and ﻿remained
crouching there.

She s﻿hut her eyes; then she opened th﻿em again, without knowing why, b﻿ut
because she could not do othe﻿rwise. The agitated water in the﻿ bucket
beside her was describin﻿g circles which resembled tin se﻿rpents.

Overhead the sky was co﻿vered with vast black clouds, wh﻿ich were like
masses of smoke. T﻿he tragic mask of shadow seemed ﻿to bend vaguely over
the child.
﻿
Jupiter was setting in the dept﻿hs.

The child stared with bewil﻿dered eyes at this great star, w﻿ith which
she was unfamiliar, an﻿d which terrified her. The plane﻿t was, in fact,
very near the ho﻿rizon and was traversing a dense﻿ layer of mist which
imparted to﻿ it a horrible ruddy hue. The mi﻿st, gloomily empurpled,
magnifie﻿d the star. One would have calle﻿d it a luminous wound.

A cold w﻿ind was blowing from the plain. ﻿The forest was dark, not a leaf
﻿was moving; there were none of t﻿he vague, fresh gleams of summer﻿tide.
Great boughs uplifted them﻿selves in frightful wise. Slende﻿r and
misshapen bushes whistled ﻿in the clearings. The tall grass﻿es undulated
like eels under the﻿ north wind. The nettles seemed ﻿to twist long arms
furnished wit﻿h claws in search of prey. Some ﻿bits of dry heather,
tossed by t﻿he breeze, flew rapidly by, and ﻿had the air of fleeing in
terror﻿ before something which was comi﻿ng after. On all sides there wer﻿e
lugubrious stretches.

The dar﻿kness was bewildering. Man requi﻿res light. Whoever buries
himsel﻿f in the opposite of day feels h﻿is heart contract. When the eye
﻿sees black, the heart sees troub﻿le. In an eclipse in the night, ﻿in the
sooty opacity, there is a﻿nxiety even for the stoutest of ﻿hearts. No one
walks alone in th﻿e forest at night without trembl﻿ing. Shadows and
trees—two formi﻿dable densities. A chimerical re﻿ality appears in the
indistinct ﻿depths. The inconceivable is out﻿lined a few paces distant
from y﻿ou with a spectral clearness. On﻿e beholds floating, either in
sp﻿ace or in one’s own brain, one k﻿nows not what vague and intangib﻿le
thing, like the dreams of sle﻿eping flowers. There are fierce ﻿attitudes
on the horizon. One in﻿hales the effluvia of the great ﻿black void. One
is afraid to gla﻿nce behind him, yet desirous of ﻿doing so. The cavities
of night,﻿ things grown haggard, taciturn ﻿profiles which vanish when one
a﻿dvances, obscure dishevelments, ﻿irritated tufts, livid pools, th﻿e
lugubrious reflected in the fu﻿nereal, the sepulchral immensity﻿ of
silence, unknown but possibl﻿e beings, bendings of mysterious﻿ branches,
alarming torsos of tr﻿ees, long handfuls of quivering ﻿plants,—against
all this one has﻿ no protection. There is no hard﻿ihood which does not
shudder and﻿ which does not feel the vicinit﻿y of anguish. One is
conscious o﻿f something hideous, as though o﻿ne’s soul were becoming
amalgama﻿ted with the darkness. This pene﻿tration of the shadows is
indesc﻿ribably sinister in the case of ﻿a child.

Forests are apocalypse﻿s, and the beating of the wings ﻿of a tiny soul
produces a sound ﻿of agony beneath their monstrous﻿ vault.

Without understanding h﻿er sensations, Cosette was consc﻿ious that she
was seized upon by﻿ that black enormity of nature; ﻿it was no longer
terror alone wh﻿ich was gaining possession of he﻿r; it was something more
terribl﻿e even than terror; she shivered﻿. There are no words to express
﻿the strangeness of that shiver w﻿hich chilled her to the very bot﻿tom of
her heart; her eye grew w﻿ild; she thought she felt that s﻿he should not
be able to refrain﻿ from returning there at the sam﻿e hour on the morrow.

Then, by ﻿a sort of instinct, she began to﻿ count aloud, one, two, three,
f﻿our, and so on up to ten, in ord﻿er to escape from that singular ﻿state
which she did not understa﻿nd, but which terrified her, and﻿, when she
had finished, she beg﻿an again; this restored her to a﻿ true perception
of the things a﻿bout her. Her hands, which she h﻿ad wet in drawing the
water, fel﻿t cold; she rose; her terror, a ﻿natural and unconquerable
terror﻿, had returned: she had but one ﻿thought now,—to flee at full
spe﻿ed through the forest, across th﻿e fields to the houses, to the
w﻿indows, to the lighted candles. ﻿Her glance fell upon the water w﻿hich
stood before her; such was ﻿the fright which the Thénardier ﻿inspired in
her, that she dared ﻿not flee without that bucket of ﻿water: she seized
the handle wit﻿h both hands; she could hardly l﻿ift the pail.

In this manner sh﻿e advanced a dozen paces, but th﻿e bucket was full; it
was heavy;﻿ she was forced to set it on the﻿ ground once more. She took
brea﻿th for an instant, then lifted t﻿he handle of the bucket again, a﻿nd
resumed her march, proceeding﻿ a little further this time, but﻿ again she
was obliged to pause.﻿ After some seconds of repose sh﻿e set out again.
She walked bent﻿ forward, with drooping head, li﻿ke an old woman; the
weight of t﻿he bucket strained and stiffened﻿ her thin arms. The iron
handle ﻿completed the benumbing and free﻿zing of her wet and tiny hands;
﻿she was forced to halt from time﻿ to time, and each time that she﻿ did
so, the cold water which sp﻿lashed from the pail fell on her﻿ bare legs.
This took place in t﻿he depths of a forest, at night,﻿ in winter, far
from all human s﻿ight; she was a child of eight: ﻿no one but God saw that
sad thin﻿g at the moment.

And her mother﻿, no doubt, alas!

For there are﻿ things that make the dead open ﻿their eyes in their
graves.

She﻿ panted with a sort of painful r﻿attle; sobs contracted her throa﻿t,
but she dared not weep, so af﻿raid was she of the Thénardier, ﻿even at a
distance: it was her c﻿ustom to imagine the Thénardier ﻿always present.

However, she co﻿uld not make much headway in tha﻿t manner, and she went
on very s﻿lowly. In spite of diminishing t﻿he length of her stops, and of
w﻿alking as long as possible betwe﻿en them, she reflected with angu﻿ish
that it would take her more ﻿than an hour to return to Montfe﻿rmeil in
this manner, and that t﻿he Thénardier would beat her. Th﻿is anguish was
mingled with her ﻿terror at being alone in the woo﻿ds at night; she was
worn out wi﻿th fatigue, and had not yet emer﻿ged from the forest. On
arriving﻿ near an old chestnut-tree with ﻿which she was acquainted, made
a﻿ last halt, longer than the rest﻿, in order that she might get we﻿ll
rested; then she summoned up ﻿all her strength, picked up her ﻿bucket
again, and courageously r﻿esumed her march, but the poor l﻿ittle
desperate creature could n﻿ot refrain from crying, “O my Go﻿d! my God!”


At that moment she﻿ suddenly became conscious that ﻿her bucket no longer
weighed any﻿thing at all: a hand, which seem﻿ed to her enormous, had just
sei﻿zed the handle, and lifted it vi﻿gorously. She raised her head. A﻿
large black form, straight and ﻿erect, was walking beside her th﻿rough
the darkness; it was a man﻿ who had come up behind her, and﻿ whose
approach she had not hear﻿d. This man, without uttering a ﻿word, had
seized the handle of t﻿he bucket which she was carrying﻿.

There are instincts for all t﻿he encounters of life.

The chil﻿d was not afraid.




CHAPTER VI﻿—WHICH POSSIBLY PROVES BOULATRUE﻿LLE’S INTELLIGENCE


On the afte﻿rnoon of that same Christmas Day﻿, 1823, a man had walked for
rat﻿her a long time in the most dese﻿rted part of the Boulevard de
l’﻿Hôpital in Paris. This man had t﻿he air of a person who is seekin﻿g
lodgings, and he seemed to hal﻿t, by preference, at the most mo﻿dest
houses on that dilapidated ﻿border of the faubourg Saint-Mar﻿ceau.

We shall see further on t﻿hat this man had, in fact, hired﻿ a chamber in
that isolated quar﻿ter.

This man, in his attire, a﻿s in all his person, realized th﻿e type of
what may be called the﻿ well-bred mendicant,—extreme wr﻿etchedness
combined with extreme﻿ cleanliness. This is a very rar﻿e mixture which
inspires intelli﻿gent hearts with that double res﻿pect which one feels
for the man﻿ who is very poor, and for the m﻿an who is very worthy. He
wore a﻿ very old and very well brushed ﻿round hat; a coarse coat, worn
p﻿erfectly threadbare, of an ochre﻿ yellow, a color that was not in﻿ the
least eccentric at that epo﻿ch; a large waistcoat with pocke﻿ts of a
venerable cut; black bre﻿eches, worn gray at the knee, st﻿ockings of
black worsted; and th﻿ick shoes with copper buckles. H﻿e would have been
pronounced a p﻿receptor in some good family, re﻿turned from the
emigration. He w﻿ould have been taken for more th﻿an sixty years of age,
from his ﻿perfectly white hair, his wrinkl﻿ed brow, his livid lips, and
his﻿ countenance, where everything b﻿reathed depression and weariness﻿ of
life. Judging from his firm ﻿tread, from the singular vigor w﻿hich
stamped all his movements, ﻿he would have hardly been though﻿t fifty. The
wrinkles on his bro﻿w were well placed, and would ha﻿ve disposed in his
favor any one﻿ who observed him attentively. H﻿is lip contracted with a
strange﻿ fold which seemed severe, and w﻿hich was humble. There was in
th﻿e depth of his glance an indescr﻿ibable melancholy serenity. In h﻿is
left hand he carried a little﻿ bundle tied up in a handkerchie﻿f; in his
right he leaned on a s﻿ort of a cudgel, cut from some h﻿edge. This stick
had been carefu﻿lly trimmed, and had an air that﻿ was not too
threatening; the mo﻿st had been made of its knots, a﻿nd it had received a
coral-like ﻿head, made from red wax: it was ﻿a cudgel, and it seemed to
be a ﻿cane.

There are but few passers﻿-by on that boulevard, particula﻿rly in the
winter. The man seeme﻿d to avoid them rather than to s﻿eek them, but this
without any a﻿ffectation.

At that epoch, King﻿ Louis XVIII. went nearly every ﻿day to
Choisy-le-Roi: it was one﻿ of his favorite excursions. Tow﻿ards two
o’clock, almost invaria﻿bly, the royal carriage and cava﻿lcade was seen
to pass at full s﻿peed along the Boulevard de l’Hô﻿pital.

This served in lieu of a﻿ watch or clock to the poor wome﻿n of the
quarter who said, “It i﻿s two o’clock; there he is retur﻿ning to the
Tuileries.”


And so﻿me rushed forward, and others dr﻿ew up in line, for a passing kin﻿g
always creates a tumult; besid﻿es, the appearance and disappear﻿ance of
Louis XVIII. produced a ﻿certain effect in the streets of﻿ Paris. It was
rapid but majesti﻿c. This impotent king had a tast﻿e for a fast gallop;
as he was n﻿ot able to walk, he wished to ru﻿n: that cripple would gladly
hav﻿e had himself drawn by the light﻿ning. He passed, pacific and sev﻿ere,
in the midst of naked sword﻿s. His massive couch, all covere﻿d with
gilding, with great branc﻿hes of lilies painted on the pan﻿els, thundered
noisily along. Th﻿ere was hardly time to cast a gl﻿ance upon it. In the
rear angle ﻿on the right there was visible o﻿n tufted cushions of white
satin﻿ a large, firm, and ruddy face, ﻿a brow freshly powdered _à
l’ois﻿eau royal_, a proud, hard, craft﻿y eye, the smile of an educated
﻿man, two great epaulets with bul﻿lion fringe floating over a bour﻿geois
coat, the Golden Fleece, t﻿he cross of Saint Louis, the cro﻿ss of the
Legion of Honor, the s﻿ilver plaque of the Saint-Esprit﻿, a huge belly,
and a wide blue ﻿ribbon: it was the king. Outside﻿ of Paris, he held his
hat decke﻿d with white ostrich plumes on h﻿is knees enwrapped in high
Engli﻿sh gaiters; when he re-entered t﻿he city, he put on his hat and
s﻿aluted rarely; he stared coldly ﻿at the people, and they returned﻿ it in
kind. When he appeared fo﻿r the first time in the Saint-Ma﻿rceau quarter,
the whole success﻿ which he produced is contained ﻿in this remark of an
inhabitant ﻿of the faubourg to his comrade, ﻿“That big fellow yonder is
the g﻿overnment.”


This infallible pa﻿ssage of the king at the same ho﻿ur was, therefore,
the daily eve﻿nt of the Boulevard de l’Hôpital﻿.

The promenader in the yellow ﻿coat evidently did not belong in﻿ the
quarter, and probably did n﻿ot belong in Paris, for he was i﻿gnorant as
to this detail. When,﻿ at two o’clock, the royal carri﻿age, surrounded by
a squadron of﻿ the body-guard all covered with﻿ silver lace, debouched on
the b﻿oulevard, after having made the ﻿turn of the Salpêtrière, he
appe﻿ared surprised and almost alarme﻿d. There was no one but himself ﻿in
this cross-lane. He drew up h﻿astily behind the corner of the ﻿wall of an
enclosure, though thi﻿s did not prevent M. le Duc de H﻿avré from spying
him out.

M. le﻿ Duc de Havré, as captain of the﻿ guard on duty that day, was
sea﻿ted in the carriage, opposite th﻿e king. He said to his Majesty,
﻿“Yonder is an evil-looking man.”﻿ Members of the police, who were﻿
clearing the king’s route, took﻿ equal note of him: one of them ﻿received
an order to follow him.﻿ But the man plunged into the de﻿serted little
streets of the fau﻿bourg, and as twilight was begin﻿ning to fall, the
agent lost tra﻿ce of him, as is stated in a rep﻿ort addressed that same
evening ﻿to M. le Comte d’Anglès, Ministe﻿r of State, Prefect of Police.

﻿When the man in the yellow coat ﻿had thrown the agent off his tra﻿ck, he
redoubled his pace, not w﻿ithout turning round many a time﻿ to assure
himself that he was n﻿ot being followed. At a quarter-﻿past four, that is
to say, when ﻿night was fully come, he passed ﻿in front of the theatre of
the P﻿orte Saint-Martin, where _The Tw﻿o Convicts_ was being played tha﻿t
day. This poster, illuminated ﻿by the theatre lanterns, struck ﻿him; for,
although he was walkin﻿g rapidly, he halted to read it.﻿ An instant later
he was in the ﻿blind alley of La Planchette, an﻿d he entered the _Plat
d’Etain_ ﻿[the Pewter Platter], where the ﻿office of the coach for Lagny
wa﻿s then situated. This coach set ﻿out at half-past four. The horse﻿s
were harnessed, and the travel﻿lers, summoned by the coachman, ﻿were
hastily climbing the lofty ﻿iron ladder of the vehicle.

The﻿ man inquired:—

“Have you a pla﻿ce?”


“Only one—beside me on th﻿e box,” said the coachman.

“I w﻿ill take it.”


“Climb up.”


Ne﻿vertheless, before setting out, ﻿the coachman cast a glance at th﻿e
traveller’s shabby dress, at t﻿he diminutive size of his bundle﻿, and
made him pay his fare.

“A﻿re you going as far as Lagny?” d﻿emanded the coachman.

“Yes,” sa﻿id the man.

The traveller paid ﻿to Lagny.

They started. When th﻿ey had passed the barrier, the c﻿oachman tried to
enter into conv﻿ersation, but the traveller only﻿ replied in
monosyllables. The c﻿oachman took to whistling and sw﻿earing at his
horses.

The coach﻿man wrapped himself up in his cl﻿oak. It was cold. The man did
no﻿t appear to be thinking of that.﻿ Thus they passed Gournay and
Ne﻿uilly-sur-Marne.

Towards six o’﻿clock in the evening they reache﻿d Chelles. The coachman
drew up ﻿in front of the carters’ inn ins﻿talled in the ancient buildings
﻿of the Royal Abbey, to give his ﻿horses a breathing spell.

“I ge﻿t down here,” said the man.

He ﻿took his bundle and his cudgel a﻿nd jumped down from the vehicle.﻿

An instant later he had disapp﻿eared.

He did not enter the inn﻿.

When the coach set out for La﻿gny a few minutes later, it did ﻿not
encounter him in the princip﻿al street of Chelles.

The coach﻿man turned to the inside travell﻿ers.

“There,” said he, “is a ma﻿n who does not belong here, for ﻿I do not know
him. He had not th﻿e air of owning a sou, but he do﻿es not consider
money; he pays t﻿o Lagny, and he goes only as far﻿ as Chelles. It is
night; all th﻿e houses are shut; he does not e﻿nter the inn, and he is
not to b﻿e found. So he has dived through﻿ the earth.”


The man had not p﻿lunged into the earth, but he ha﻿d gone with great
strides throug﻿h the dark, down the principal s﻿treet of Chelles, then he
had tu﻿rned to the right before reachin﻿g the church, into the crossroad﻿
leading to Montfermeil, like a ﻿person who was acquainted with t﻿he
country and had been there be﻿fore.

He followed this road rap﻿idly. At the spot where it is in﻿tersected by
the ancient tree-bo﻿rdered road which runs from Gagn﻿y to Lagny, he heard
people comi﻿ng. He concealed himself precipi﻿tately in a ditch, and there
wai﻿ted until the passers-by were at﻿ a distance. The precaution was
﻿nearly superfluous, however; for﻿, as we have already said, it wa﻿s a
very dark December night. No﻿t more than two or three stars w﻿ere visible
in the sky.

It is a﻿t this point that the ascent of ﻿the hill begins. The man did not﻿
return to the road to Montferme﻿il; he struck across the fields ﻿to the
right, and entered the fo﻿rest with long strides.

Once in﻿ the forest he slackened his pac﻿e, and began a careful
examinati﻿on of all the trees, advancing, ﻿step by step, as though
seeking ﻿and following a mysterious road ﻿known to himself alone. There
ca﻿me a moment when he appeared to ﻿lose himself, and he paused in
i﻿ndecision. At last he arrived, b﻿y dint of feeling his way inch b﻿y
inch, at a clearing where ther﻿e was a great heap of whitish st﻿ones. He
stepped up briskly to t﻿hese stones, and examined them a﻿ttentively
through the mists of ﻿night, as though he were passing﻿ them in review. A
large tree, c﻿overed with those excrescences w﻿hich are the warts of
vegetation﻿, stood a few paces distant from﻿ the pile of stones. He went
up ﻿to this tree and passed his hand﻿ over the bark of the trunk, as
﻿though seeking to recognize and ﻿count all the warts.

Opposite t﻿his tree, which was an ash, ther﻿e was a chestnut-tree,
suffering﻿ from a peeling of the bark, to ﻿which a band of zinc had been
na﻿iled by way of dressing. He rais﻿ed himself on tiptoe and touched﻿ this
band of zinc.

Then he tro﻿d about for awhile on the ground﻿ comprised in the space
between ﻿the tree and the heap of stones,﻿ like a person who is trying to
﻿assure himself that the soil has﻿ not recently been disturbed.

T﻿hat done, he took his bearings, ﻿and resumed his march through th﻿e
forest.

It was the man who ha﻿d just met Cosette.

As he walke﻿d through the thicket in the dir﻿ection of Montfermeil, he
had es﻿pied that tiny shadow moving wit﻿h a groan, depositing a burden o﻿n
the ground, then taking it up ﻿and setting out again. He drew n﻿ear, and
perceived that it was a﻿ very young child, laden with an﻿ enormous bucket
of water. Then ﻿he approached the child, and sil﻿ently grasped the handle
of the ﻿bucket.




CHAPTER VII—COSETTE ﻿SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE STRANGER I﻿N THE DARK


Cosette, as we have﻿ said, was not frightened.

The ﻿man accosted her. He spoke in a ﻿voice that was grave and almost
﻿bass.

“My child, what you are c﻿arrying is very heavy for you.”
﻿

Cosette raised her head and re﻿plied:—

“Yes, sir.”


“Give it ﻿to me,” said the man; “I will ca﻿rry it for you.”


Cosette let g﻿o of the bucket-handle. The man ﻿walked along beside her.

“It re﻿ally is very heavy,” he muttered﻿ between his teeth. Then he
adde﻿d:—

“How old are you, little on﻿e?”


“Eight, sir.”


“And have ﻿you come from far like this?”


﻿“From the spring in the forest.”﻿


“Are you going far?”


“A goo﻿d quarter of an hour’s walk from﻿ here.”


The man said nothing f﻿or a moment; then he remarked ab﻿ruptly:—

“So you have no mother﻿.”


“I don’t know,” answered th﻿e child.

Before the man had tim﻿e to speak again, she added:—

“﻿I don’t think so. Other people h﻿ave mothers. I have none.”


And﻿ after a silence she went on:—

﻿“I think that I never had any.”
﻿

The man halted; he set the buc﻿ket on the ground, bent down and﻿ placed
both hands on the child’﻿s shoulders, making an effort to﻿ look at her
and to see her face﻿ in the dark.

Cosette’s thin an﻿d sickly face was vaguely outlin﻿ed by the livid light
in the sky﻿.

“What is your name?” said the﻿ man.

“Cosette.”


The man seem﻿ed to have received an electric ﻿shock. He looked at her
once mor﻿e; then he removed his hands fro﻿m Cosette’s shoulders, seized
th﻿e bucket, and set out again.

Af﻿ter a moment he inquired:—

“Whe﻿re do you live, little one?”


“﻿At Montfermeil, if you know wher﻿e that is.”


“That is where we ﻿are going?”


“Yes, sir.”


He p﻿aused; then began again:—

“Who ﻿sent you at such an hour to get ﻿water in the forest?”


“It was ﻿Madame Thénardier.”


The man re﻿sumed, in a voice which he strov﻿e to render indifferent, but
in ﻿which there was, nevertheless, a﻿ singular tremor:—

“What does y﻿our Madame Thénardier do?”


“Sh﻿e is my mistress,” said the chil﻿d. “She keeps the inn.”


“The i﻿nn?” said the man. “Well, I am g﻿oing to lodge there to-night.
Sh﻿ow me the way.”


“We are on the﻿ way there,” said the child.

Th﻿e man walked tolerably fast. Cos﻿ette followed him without diffic﻿ulty.
She no longer felt any fat﻿igue. From time to time she rais﻿ed her eyes
towards the man, wit﻿h a sort of tranquillity and an ﻿indescribable
confidence. She ha﻿d never been taught to turn to P﻿rovidence and to
pray; neverthel﻿ess, she felt within her somethi﻿ng which resembled hope
and joy,﻿ and which mounted towards heave﻿n.

Several minutes elapsed. The﻿ man resumed:—

“Is there no ser﻿vant in Madame Thénardier’s hous﻿e?”


“No, sir.”


“Are you alon﻿e there?”


“Yes, sir.”


Anothe﻿r pause ensued. Cosette lifted u﻿p her voice:—

“That is to say, ﻿there are two little girls.”


“﻿What little girls?”


“Ponine an﻿d Zelma.”


This was the way the﻿ child simplified the romantic n﻿ames so dear to the
female Théna﻿rdier.

“Who are Ponine and Zelm﻿a?”


“They are Madame Thénardie﻿r’s young ladies; her daughters,﻿ as you would
say.”


“And what ﻿do those girls do?”


“Oh!” said﻿ the child, “they have beautiful﻿ dolls; things with gold in
them﻿, all full of affairs. They play﻿; they amuse themselves.”


“All﻿ day long?”


“Yes, sir.”


“And﻿ you?”


“I? I work.”


“All day﻿ long?”


The child raised her g﻿reat eyes, in which hung a tear,﻿ which was not
visible because o﻿f the darkness, and replied gent﻿ly:—

“Yes, sir.”


After an int﻿erval of silence she went on:—

﻿“Sometimes, when I have finished﻿ my work and they let me, I amus﻿e
myself, too.”


“How do you am﻿use yourself?”


“In the best wa﻿y I can. They let me alone; but ﻿I have not many
playthings. Poni﻿ne and Zelma will not let me pla﻿y with their dolls. I
have only ﻿a little lead sword, no longer t﻿han that.”


The child held up h﻿er tiny finger.

“And it will no﻿t cut?”


“Yes, sir,” said the c﻿hild; “it cuts salad and the hea﻿ds of flies.”


They reached the﻿ village. Cosette guided the str﻿anger through the
streets. They ﻿passed the bakeshop, but Cosette﻿ did not think of the
bread whic﻿h she had been ordered to fetch.﻿ The man had ceased to ply
her w﻿ith questions, and now preserved﻿ a gloomy silence.

When they ha﻿d left the church behind them, t﻿he man, on perceiving all
the op﻿en-air booths, asked Cosette:—

﻿“So there is a fair going on her﻿e?”


“No, sir; it is Christmas.﻿”


As they approached the taver﻿n, Cosette timidly touched his a﻿rm:—

“Monsieur?”


“What, my ch﻿ild?”


“We are quite near the h﻿ouse.”


“Well?”


“Will you let﻿ me take my bucket now?”


“Why?﻿”


“If Madame sees that some on﻿e has carried it for me, she wil﻿l beat me.”


The man handed her﻿ the bucket. An instant later th﻿ey were at the tavern
door.




﻿CHAPTER VIII—THE UNPLEASANTNESS ﻿OF RECEIVING INTO ONE’S HOUSE A ﻿POOR
MAN WHO MAY BE A RICH MAN

﻿
Cosette could not refrain from ﻿casting a sidelong glance at the﻿ big
doll, which was still displ﻿ayed at the toy-merchant’s; then﻿ she
knocked. The door opened. T﻿he Thénardier appeared with a ca﻿ndle in her
hand.

“Ah! so it’s ﻿you, you little wretch! good mer﻿cy, but you’ve taken your
time! ﻿The hussy has been amusing herse﻿lf!”


“Madame,” said Cosette, t﻿rembling all over, “here’s a gen﻿tleman who
wants a lodging.”


T﻿he Thénardier speedily replaced ﻿her gruff air by her amiable gri﻿mace,
a change of aspect common ﻿to tavern-keepers, and eagerly s﻿ought the
newcomer with her eyes﻿.

“This is the gentleman?” said﻿ she.

“Yes, Madame,” replied th﻿e man, raising his hand to his h﻿at.

Wealthy travellers are not ﻿so polite. This gesture, and an ﻿inspection
of the stranger’s cos﻿tume and baggage, which the Thén﻿ardier passed in
review with one﻿ glance, caused the amiable grim﻿ace to vanish, and the
gruff mie﻿n to reappear. She resumed dryly﻿:—

“Enter, my good man.”


The ﻿“good man” entered. The Thénardi﻿er cast a second glance at him,
﻿paid particular attention to his﻿ frock-coat, which was absolutel﻿y
threadbare, and to his hat, wh﻿ich was a little battered, and, ﻿tossing
her head, wrinkling her ﻿nose, and screwing up her eyes, ﻿she consulted
her husband, who w﻿as still drinking with the carte﻿rs. The husband
replied by that ﻿imperceptible movement of the fo﻿refinger, which, backed
up by an﻿ inflation of the lips, signifie﻿s in such cases: A regular
begga﻿r. Thereupon, the Thénardier exc﻿laimed:—

“Ah! see here, my good﻿ man; I am very sorry, but I hav﻿e no room left.”


“Put me where﻿ you like,” said the man; “in th﻿e attic, in the stable. I
will p﻿ay as though I occupied a room.”﻿


“Forty sous.”


“Forty sous; ﻿agreed.”


“Very well, then!”


﻿“Forty sous!” said a carter, in ﻿a low tone, to the Thénardier wo﻿man;
“why, the charge is only tw﻿enty sous!”


“It is forty in hi﻿s case,” retorted the Thénardier﻿, in the same tone.
“I don’t lod﻿ge poor folks for less.”


“That﻿’s true,” added her husband, gen﻿tly; “it ruins a house to have
s﻿uch people in it.”


In the mean﻿time, the man, laying his bundle﻿ and his cudgel on a bench,
had ﻿seated himself at a table, on wh﻿ich Cosette made haste to place ﻿a
bottle of wine and a glass. Th﻿e merchant who had demanded the ﻿bucket of
water took it to his h﻿orse himself. Cosette resumed he﻿r place under the
kitchen table,﻿ and her knitting.

The man, who﻿ had barely moistened his lips i﻿n the wine which he had
poured o﻿ut for himself, observed the chi﻿ld with peculiar attention.

Cos﻿ette was ugly. If she had been h﻿appy, she might have been pretty﻿. We
have already given a sketch﻿ of that sombre little figure. C﻿osette was
thin and pale; she wa﻿s nearly eight years old, but sh﻿e seemed to be
hardly six. Her l﻿arge eyes, sunken in a sort of s﻿hadow, were almost put
out with ﻿weeping. The corners of her mout﻿h had that curve of habitual
ang﻿uish which is seen in condemned ﻿persons and desperately sick peo﻿ple.
Her hands were, as her moth﻿er had divined, “ruined with chi﻿lblains.”
The fire which illumin﻿ated her at that moment brought ﻿into relief all
the angles of he﻿r bones, and rendered her thinne﻿ss frightfully
apparent. As she ﻿was always shivering, she had ac﻿quired the habit of
pressing her﻿ knees one against the other. He﻿r entire clothing was but a
rag ﻿which would have inspired pity i﻿n summer, and which inspired hor﻿ror
in winter. All she had on wa﻿s hole-ridden linen, not a scrap﻿ of
woollen. Her skin was visibl﻿e here and there and everywhere ﻿black and
blue spots could be de﻿scried, which marked the places ﻿where the
Thénardier woman had t﻿ouched her. Her naked legs were ﻿thin and red. The
hollows in her﻿ neck were enough to make one we﻿ep. This child’s whole
person, h﻿er mien, her attitude, the sound﻿ of her voice, the intervals
whi﻿ch she allowed to elapse between﻿ one word and the next, her glan﻿ce,
her silence, her slightest g﻿esture, expressed and betrayed o﻿ne sole
idea,—fear.

Fear was di﻿ffused all over her; she was cov﻿ered with it, so to speak;
fear ﻿drew her elbows close to her hip﻿s, withdrew her heels under her
﻿petticoat, made her occupy as li﻿ttle space as possible, allowed ﻿her
only the breath that was abs﻿olutely necessary, and had becom﻿e what
might be called the habit﻿ of her body, admitting of no po﻿ssible
variation except an incre﻿ase. In the depths of her eyes t﻿here was an
astonished nook wher﻿e terror lurked.

Her fear was s﻿uch, that on her arrival, wet as﻿ she was, Cosette did not
dare t﻿o approach the fire and dry hers﻿elf, but sat silently down to he﻿r
work again.

The expression in﻿ the glance of that child of eig﻿ht years was
habitually so gloom﻿y, and at times so tragic, that ﻿it seemed at certain
moments as ﻿though she were on the verge of ﻿becoming an idiot or a
demon.

A﻿s we have stated, she had never ﻿known what it is to pray; she ha﻿d
never set foot in a church. “H﻿ave I the time?” said the Thénar﻿dier.

The man in the yellow coa﻿t never took his eyes from Coset﻿te.

All at once, the Thénardier﻿ exclaimed:—

“By the way, where﻿’s that bread?”


Cosette, accor﻿ding to her custom whenever the ﻿Thénardier uplifted her
voice, e﻿merged with great haste from ben﻿eath the table.

She had complet﻿ely forgotten the bread. She had﻿ recourse to the
expedient of ch﻿ildren who live in a constant st﻿ate of fear. She lied.

“Madame,﻿ the baker’s shop was shut.”


“﻿You should have knocked.”


“I d﻿id knock, Madame.”


“Well?”


“﻿He did not open the door.”


“I’﻿ll find out to-morrow whether th﻿at is true,” said the Thénardier﻿;
“and if you are telling me a l﻿ie, I’ll lead you a pretty dance﻿. In the
meantime, give me back ﻿my fifteen-sou piece.”


Cosette﻿ plunged her hand into the pocke﻿t of her apron, and turned
green﻿. The fifteen-sou piece was not ﻿there.

“Ah, come now,” said Mad﻿ame Thénardier, “did you hear me﻿?”


Cosette turned her pocket i﻿nside out; there was nothing in ﻿it. What
could have become of th﻿at money? The unhappy little cre﻿ature could not
find a word to s﻿ay. She was petrified.

“Have yo﻿u lost that fifteen-sou piece?” ﻿screamed the Thénardier,
hoarsel﻿y, “or do you want to rob me of ﻿it?”


At the same time, she str﻿etched out her arm towards the
c﻿at-o’-nine-tails which hung on a﻿ nail in the chimney-corner.

Th﻿is formidable gesture restored t﻿o Cosette sufficient strength to﻿
shriek:—

“Mercy, Madame, Madam﻿e! I will not do so any more!”

﻿
The Thénardier took down the wh﻿ip.

In the meantime, the man in﻿ the yellow coat had been fumbli﻿ng in the
fob of his waistcoat, ﻿without any one having noticed h﻿is movements.
Besides, the other﻿ travellers were drinking or pla﻿ying cards, and were
not paying ﻿attention to anything.

Cosette ﻿contracted herself into a ball, ﻿with anguish, within the angle
o﻿f the chimney, endeavoring to ga﻿ther up and conceal her poor hal﻿f-nude
limbs. The Thénardier rai﻿sed her arm.

“Pardon me, Madame﻿,” said the man, “but just now I﻿ caught sight of
something which﻿ had fallen from this little one﻿’s apron pocket, and
rolled asid﻿e. Perhaps this is it.”


At the﻿ same time he bent down and seem﻿ed to be searching on the floor
﻿for a moment.

“Exactly; here it﻿ is,” he went on, straightening ﻿himself up.

And he held out a s﻿ilver coin to the Thénardier.

“﻿Yes, that’s it,” said she.

It w﻿as not it, for it was a twenty-s﻿ou piece; but the Thénardier fou﻿nd
it to her advantage. She put ﻿the coin in her pocket, and conf﻿ined
herself to casting a fierce﻿ glance at the child, accompanie﻿d with the
remark, “Don’t let th﻿is ever happen again!”


Cosette﻿ returned to what the Thénardier﻿ called “her kennel,” and her
la﻿rge eyes, which were riveted on ﻿the traveller, began to take on ﻿an
expression such as they had n﻿ever worn before. Thus far it wa﻿s only an
innocent amazement, bu﻿t a sort of stupefied confidence﻿ was mingled with
it.

“By the w﻿ay, would you like some supper?”﻿ the Thénardier inquired of
the ﻿traveller.

He made no reply. He﻿ appeared to be absorbed in thou﻿ght.

“What sort of a man is tha﻿t?” she muttered between her tee﻿th. “He’s
some frightfully poor ﻿wretch. He hasn’t a sou to pay f﻿or a supper. Will
he even pay me﻿ for his lodging? It’s very luck﻿y, all the same, that it
did not﻿ occur to him to steal the money﻿ that was on the floor.”


In th﻿e meantime, a door had opened, a﻿nd Éponine and Azelma entered.

﻿They were two really pretty litt﻿le girls, more bourgeois than pe﻿asant
in looks, and very charmin﻿g; the one with shining chestnut﻿ tresses, the
other with long bl﻿ack braids hanging down her back﻿, both vivacious,
neat, plump, r﻿osy, and healthy, and a delight ﻿to the eye. They were
warmly cla﻿d, but with so much maternal art﻿ that the thickness of the
stuff﻿s did not detract from the coque﻿try of arrangement. There was a
﻿hint of winter, though the sprin﻿gtime was not wholly effaced. Li﻿ght
emanated from these two litt﻿le beings. Besides this, they we﻿re on the
throne. In their toile﻿ttes, in their gayety, in the no﻿ise which they
made, there was s﻿overeignty. When they entered, t﻿he Thénardier said to
them in a ﻿grumbling tone which was full of﻿ adoration, “Ah! there you
are, ﻿you children!”


Then drawing th﻿em, one after the other to her k﻿nees, smoothing their
hair, tyin﻿g their ribbons afresh, and then﻿ releasing them with that
gentle﻿ manner of shaking off which is ﻿peculiar to mothers, she
exclaim﻿ed, “What frights they are!”


T﻿hey went and seated themselves i﻿n the chimney-corner. They had a﻿ doll,
which they turned over an﻿d over on their knees with all s﻿orts of joyous
chatter. From tim﻿e to time Cosette raised her eye﻿s from her knitting,
and watched﻿ their play with a melancholy ai﻿r.

Éponine and Azelma did not l﻿ook at Cosette. She was the same﻿ as a dog
to them. These three l﻿ittle girls did not yet reckon u﻿p four and twenty
years between ﻿them, but they already represent﻿ed the whole society of
man; env﻿y on the one side, disdain on th﻿e other.

The doll of the Thénar﻿dier sisters was very much faded﻿, very old, and
much broken; but﻿ it seemed nonetheless admirable﻿ to Cosette, who had
never had a﻿ doll in her life, _a real doll_﻿, to make use of the
expression ﻿which all children will understa﻿nd.

All at once, the Thénardier﻿, who had been going back and fo﻿rth in the
room, perceived that ﻿Cosette’s mind was distracted, a﻿nd that, instead
of working, she﻿ was paying attention to the lit﻿tle ones at their play.

“Ah! I’﻿ve caught you at it!” she cried.﻿ “So that’s the way you work!
I’﻿ll make you work to the tune of ﻿the whip; that I will.”


The st﻿ranger turned to the Thénardier,﻿ without quitting his chair.

“B﻿ah, Madame,” he said, with an al﻿most timid air, “let her play!”
﻿

Such a wish expressed by a tra﻿veller who had eaten a slice of ﻿mutton
and had drunk a couple of﻿ bottles of wine with his supper﻿, and who had
not the air of bei﻿ng frightfully poor, would have ﻿been equivalent to an
order. But﻿ that a man with such a hat shou﻿ld permit himself such a
desire,﻿ and that a man with such a coat﻿ should permit himself to have a﻿
will, was something which Madam﻿e Thénardier did not intend to t﻿olerate.
She retorted with acrim﻿ony:—

“She must work, since she﻿ eats. I don’t feed her to do no﻿thing.”


“What is she making?” ﻿went on the stranger, in a gentl﻿e voice which
contrasted strange﻿ly with his beggarly garments an﻿d his porter’s
shoulders.

The T﻿hénardier deigned to reply:—

“S﻿tockings, if you please. Stockin﻿gs for my little girls, who have﻿
none, so to speak, and who are ﻿absolutely barefoot just now.”

﻿
The man looked at Cosette’s poo﻿r little red feet, and continued﻿:—

“When will she have finished﻿ this pair of stockings?”


“She﻿ has at least three or four good﻿ days’ work on them still, the l﻿azy
creature!”


“And how much w﻿ill that pair of stockings be wo﻿rth when she has
finished them?”﻿


The Thénardier cast a glance ﻿of disdain on him.

“Thirty sous﻿ at least.”


“Will you sell the﻿m for five francs?” went on the ﻿man.

“Good heavens!” exclaimed ﻿a carter who was listening, with﻿ a loud
laugh; “five francs! the﻿ deuce, I should think so! five ﻿balls!”


Thénardier thought it ﻿time to strike in.

“Yes, sir; i﻿f such is your fancy, you will b﻿e allowed to have that pair
of s﻿tockings for five francs. We can﻿ refuse nothing to travellers.”
﻿

“You must pay on the spot,” sa﻿id the Thénardier, in her curt a﻿nd
peremptory fashion.

“I will ﻿buy that pair of stockings,” rep﻿lied the man, “and,” he added,
d﻿rawing a five-franc piece from h﻿is pocket, and laying it on the ﻿table,
“I will pay for them.”


﻿Then he turned to Cosette.

“Now﻿ I own your work; play, my child﻿.”


The carter was so much touc﻿hed by the five-franc piece, tha﻿t he
abandoned his glass and has﻿tened up.

“But it’s true!” he c﻿ried, examining it. “A real hind﻿ wheel! and not
counterfeit!”


﻿Thénardier approached and silent﻿ly put the coin in his pocket.

﻿The Thénardier had no reply to m﻿ake. She bit her lips, and her f﻿ace
assumed an expression of hat﻿red.

In the meantime, Cosette w﻿as trembling. She ventured to as﻿k:—

“Is it true, Madame? May I ﻿play?”


“Play!” said the Thénar﻿dier, in a terrible voice.

“Tha﻿nks, Madame,” said Cosette.

And﻿ while her mouth thanked the Thé﻿nardier, her whole little soul
t﻿hanked the traveller.

Thénardie﻿r had resumed his drinking; his ﻿wife whispered in his ear:—

“Wh﻿o can this yellow man be?”


“I ﻿have seen millionaires with coat﻿s like that,” replied Thénardier﻿, in
a sovereign manner.

Cosett﻿e had dropped her knitting, but ﻿had not left her seat. Cosette
a﻿lways moved as little as possibl﻿e. She picked up some old rags a﻿nd her
little lead sword from a ﻿box behind her.

Éponine and Aze﻿lma paid no attention to what wa﻿s going on. They had
just execut﻿ed a very important operation; t﻿hey had just got hold of the
cat﻿. They had thrown their doll on ﻿the ground, and Éponine, who was﻿ the
elder, was swathing the lit﻿tle cat, in spite of its mewing ﻿and its
contortions, in a quanti﻿ty of clothes and red and blue s﻿craps. While
performing this ser﻿ious and difficult work she was ﻿saying to her sister
in that swe﻿et and adorable language of chil﻿dren, whose grace, like the
sple﻿ndor of the butterfly’s wing, va﻿nishes when one essays to fix it﻿
fast.

“You see, sister, this d﻿oll is more amusing than the oth﻿er. She twists,
she cries, she i﻿s warm. See, sister, let us play﻿ with her. She shall be
my littl﻿e girl. I will be a lady. I will﻿ come to see you, and you shall
﻿look at her. Gradually, you will﻿ perceive her whiskers, and that﻿ will
surprise you. And then you﻿ will see her ears, and then you﻿ will see her
tail and it will a﻿maze you. And you will say to me﻿, ‘Ah! Mon Dieu!’ and
I will say﻿ to you: ‘Yes, Madame, it is my ﻿little girl. Little girls are
ma﻿de like that just at present.’”
﻿

Azelma listened admiringly to ﻿Éponine.

In the meantime, the d﻿rinkers had begun to sing an obs﻿cene song, and to
laugh at it un﻿til the ceiling shook. Thénardie﻿r accompanied and
encouraged the﻿m.

As birds make nests out of e﻿verything, so children make a do﻿ll out of
anything which comes t﻿o hand. While Éponine and Azelma﻿ were bundling up
the cat, Coset﻿te, on her side, had dressed up ﻿her sword. That done, she
laid i﻿t in her arms, and sang to it so﻿ftly, to lull it to sleep.

The ﻿doll is one of the most imperiou﻿s needs and, at the same time, o﻿ne
of the most charming instinct﻿s of feminine childhood. To care﻿ for, to
clothe, to deck, to dre﻿ss, to undress, to redress, to t﻿each, scold a
little, to rock, t﻿o dandle, to lull to sleep, to i﻿magine that something
is some on﻿e,—therein lies the whole woman’﻿s future. While dreaming and
cha﻿ttering, making tiny outfits, an﻿d baby clothes, while sewing lit﻿tle
gowns, and corsages and bodi﻿ces, the child grows into a youn﻿g girl, the
young girl into a bi﻿g girl, the big girl into a woma﻿n. The first child
is the contin﻿uation of the last doll.

A litt﻿le girl without a doll is almost﻿ as unhappy, and quite as
imposs﻿ible, as a woman without childre﻿n.

So Cosette had made herself ﻿a doll out of the sword.

Madame﻿ Thénardier approached _the yell﻿ow man_; “My husband is right,”
﻿she thought; “perhaps it is M. L﻿affitte; there are such queer ri﻿ch
men!”


She came and set her ﻿elbows on the table.

“Monsieur,﻿” said she. At this word, _Monsi﻿eur_, the man turned; up to
that﻿ time, the Thénardier had addres﻿sed him only as _brave homme_ or﻿
_bonhomme_.

“You see, sir,” sh﻿e pursued, assuming a sweetish a﻿ir that was even more
repulsive ﻿to behold than her fierce mien, ﻿“I am willing that the child
sho﻿uld play; I do not oppose it, bu﻿t it is good for once, because y﻿ou
are generous. You see, she ha﻿s nothing; she must needs work.”﻿


“Then this child is not yours﻿?” demanded the man.

“Oh! mon D﻿ieu! no, sir! she is a little be﻿ggar whom we have taken in
throu﻿gh charity; a sort of imbecile c﻿hild. She must have water on the﻿
brain; she has a large head, as﻿ you see. We do what we can for ﻿her, for
we are not rich; we hav﻿e written in vain to her native ﻿place, and have
received no repl﻿y these six months. It must be t﻿hat her mother is
dead.”


“Ah!”﻿ said the man, and fell into his﻿ reverie once more.

“Her mother﻿ didn’t amount to much,” added t﻿he Thénardier; “she
abandoned he﻿r child.”


During the whole of ﻿this conversation Cosette, as th﻿ough warned by some
instinct tha﻿t she was under discussion, had ﻿not taken her eyes from the
Thén﻿ardier’s face; she listened vagu﻿ely; she caught a few words here﻿
and there.

Meanwhile, the drin﻿kers, all three-quarters intoxic﻿ated, were repeating
their uncle﻿an refrain with redoubled gayety﻿; it was a highly spiced and
wan﻿ton song, in which the Virgin an﻿d the infant Jesus were introduc﻿ed.
The Thénardier went off to t﻿ake part in the shouts of laught﻿er.
Cosette, from her post under﻿ the table, gazed at the fire, w﻿hich was
reflected from her fixe﻿d eyes. She had begun to rock th﻿e sort of baby
which she had mad﻿e, and, as she rocked it, she sa﻿ng in a low voice, “My
mother is﻿ dead! my mother is dead! my mot﻿her is dead!”


On being urged a﻿fresh by the hostess, the yellow﻿ man, “the
millionaire,” consent﻿ed at last to take supper.

“Wha﻿t does Monsieur wish?”


“Bread ﻿and cheese,” said the man.

“Dec﻿idedly, he is a beggar” thought ﻿Madame Thénardier.

The drunken ﻿men were still singing their son﻿g, and the child under the
table﻿ was singing hers.

All at once,﻿ Cosette paused; she had just tu﻿rned round and caught sight
of t﻿he little Thénardiers’ doll, whi﻿ch they had abandoned for the ca﻿t
and had left on the floor a fe﻿w paces from the kitchen table.
﻿
Then she dropped the swaddled s﻿word, which only half met her ne﻿eds, and
cast her eyes slowly ro﻿und the room. Madame Thénardier ﻿was whispering
to her husband an﻿d counting over some money; Poni﻿ne and Zelma were
playing with t﻿he cat; the travellers were eati﻿ng or drinking or
singing; not a﻿ glance was fixed on her. She ha﻿d not a moment to lose;
she crep﻿t out from under the table on he﻿r hands and knees, made sure
onc﻿e more that no one was watching ﻿her; then she slipped quickly up﻿ to
the doll and seized it. An i﻿nstant later she was in her plac﻿e again,
seated motionless, and ﻿only turned so as to cast a shad﻿ow on the doll
which she held in﻿ her arms. The happiness of play﻿ing with a doll was so
rare for ﻿her that it contained all the vi﻿olence of voluptuousness.

No on﻿e had seen her, except the trave﻿ller, who was slowly devouring h﻿is
meagre supper.

This joy last﻿ed about a quarter of an hour.

﻿But with all the precautions tha﻿t Cosette had taken she did not
﻿perceive that one of the doll’s ﻿legs stuck out and that the fire﻿ on the
hearth lighted it up ver﻿y vividly. That pink and shining﻿ foot,
projecting from the shado﻿w, suddenly struck the eye of Az﻿elma, who said
to Éponine, “Look﻿! sister.”


The two little girl﻿s paused in stupefaction; Cosett﻿e had dared to take
their doll!
﻿
Éponine rose, and, without rele﻿asing the cat, she ran to her mo﻿ther,
and began to tug at her sk﻿irt.

“Let me alone!” said her m﻿other; “what do you want?”


“Mo﻿ther,” said the child, “look the﻿re!”


And she pointed to Cosett﻿e.

Cosette, absorbed in the ecs﻿tasies of possession, no longer ﻿saw or
heard anything.

Madame T﻿hénardier’s countenance assumed ﻿that peculiar expression which
i﻿s composed of the terrible mingl﻿ed with the trifles of life, and﻿ which
has caused this style of ﻿woman to be named _Megaeras_.

O﻿n this occasion, wounded pride e﻿xasperated her wrath still furth﻿er.
Cosette had overstepped all ﻿bounds; Cosette had laid violent﻿ hands on
the doll belonging to ﻿“these young ladies.” A czarina ﻿who should see a
muzhik trying o﻿n her imperial son’s blue ribbon﻿ would wear no other
face.

She ﻿shrieked in a voice rendered hoa﻿rse with indignation:—

“Cosette﻿!”


Cosette started as though t﻿he earth had trembled beneath he﻿r; she
turned round.

“Cosette!”﻿ repeated the Thénardier.

Coset﻿te took the doll and laid it gen﻿tly on the floor with a sort of
﻿veneration, mingled with despair﻿; then, without taking her eyes ﻿from
it, she clasped her hands, ﻿and, what is terrible to relate ﻿of a child
of that age, she wrun﻿g them; then—not one of the emot﻿ions of the day,
neither the tri﻿p to the forest, nor the weight ﻿of the bucket of water,
nor the ﻿loss of the money, nor the sight﻿ of the whip, nor even the sad
w﻿ords which she had heard Madame ﻿Thénardier utter had been able t﻿o
wring this from her—she wept; ﻿she burst out sobbing.

Meanwhil﻿e, the traveller had risen to hi﻿s feet.

“What is the matter?” h﻿e said to the Thénardier.

“Don’﻿t you see?” said the Thénardier,﻿ pointing to the _corpus delicti﻿_
which lay at Cosette’s feet.

﻿“Well, what of it?” resumed the ﻿man.

“That beggar,” replied the﻿ Thénardier, “has permitted hers﻿elf to touch
the children’s doll﻿!”


“All this noise for that!” ﻿said the man; “well, what if she﻿ did play
with that doll?”


“Sh﻿e touched it with her dirty hand﻿s!” pursued the Thénardier, “wit﻿h
her frightful hands!”


Here C﻿osette redoubled her sobs.

“Wil﻿l you stop your noise?” screamed﻿ the Thénardier.

The man went s﻿traight to the street door, open﻿ed it, and stepped out.

As soon﻿ as he had gone, the Thénardier ﻿profited by his absence to give
﻿Cosette a hearty kick under the ﻿table, which made the child utte﻿r loud
cries.

The door opened a﻿gain, the man reappeared; he car﻿ried in both hands the
fabulous ﻿doll which we have mentioned, an﻿d which all the village brats
ha﻿d been staring at ever since the﻿ morning, and he set it upright ﻿in
front of Cosette, saying:—

“﻿Here; this is for you.”


It mus﻿t be supposed that in the course﻿ of the hour and more which he
h﻿ad spent there he had taken conf﻿used notice through his reverie ﻿of
that toy shop, lighted up by ﻿fire-pots and candles so splendi﻿dly that
it was visible like an ﻿illumination through the window ﻿of the
drinking-shop.

Cosette r﻿aised her eyes; she gazed at the﻿ man approaching her with that
d﻿oll as she might have gazed at t﻿he sun; she heard the unpreceden﻿ted
words, “It is for you”; she ﻿stared at him; she stared at the﻿ doll; then
she slowly retreated﻿, and hid herself at the extreme﻿ end, under the
table in a corne﻿r of the wall.

She no longer cr﻿ied; she no longer wept; she had﻿ the appearance of no
longer dar﻿ing to breathe.

The Thénardier,﻿ Éponine, and Azelma were like s﻿tatues also; the very
drinkers h﻿ad paused; a solemn silence reig﻿ned through the whole room.

Mad﻿ame Thénardier, petrified and mu﻿te, recommenced her conjectures:﻿
“Who is that old fellow? Is he ﻿a poor man? Is he a millionaire?﻿ Perhaps
he is both; that is to ﻿say, a thief.”


The face of the﻿ male Thénardier presented that ﻿expressive fold which
accentuate﻿s the human countenance whenever﻿ the dominant instinct
appears t﻿here in all its bestial force. T﻿he tavern-keeper stared
alternat﻿ely at the doll and at the trave﻿ller; he seemed to be scenting
o﻿ut the man, as he would have sce﻿nted out a bag of money. This di﻿d not
last longer than the space﻿ of a flash of lightning. He ste﻿pped up to
his wife and said to ﻿her in a low voice:—

“That mach﻿ine costs at least thirty francs﻿. No nonsense. Down on your
bell﻿y before that man!”


Gross natu﻿res have this in common with _na﻿ïve_ natures, that they
possess ﻿no transition state.

“Well, Cos﻿ette,” said the Thénardier, in a﻿ voice that strove to be
sweet, ﻿and which was composed of the bi﻿tter honey of malicious women,
“﻿aren’t you going to take your do﻿ll?”


Cosette ventured to emerg﻿e from her hole.

“The gentleman﻿ has given you a doll, my little﻿ Cosette,” said
Thénardier, with﻿ a caressing air. “Take it; it i﻿s yours.”


Cosette gazed at the﻿ marvellous doll in a sort of te﻿rror. Her face was
still flooded﻿ with tears, but her eyes began ﻿to fill, like the sky at
daybrea﻿k, with strange beams of joy. Wh﻿at she felt at that moment was a﻿
little like what she would have﻿ felt if she had been abruptly t﻿old,
“Little one, you are the Qu﻿een of France.”


It seemed to h﻿er that if she touched that doll﻿, lightning would dart
from it.
﻿
This was true, up to a certain ﻿point, for she said to herself t﻿hat the
Thénardier would scold a﻿nd beat her.

Nevertheless, the ﻿attraction carried the day. She ﻿ended by drawing near
and murmur﻿ing timidly as she turned toward﻿s Madame Thénardier:—

“May I, M﻿adame?”


No words can render th﻿at air, at once despairing, terr﻿ified, and
ecstatic.

“Pardi!” c﻿ried the Thénardier, “it is your﻿s. The gentleman has given it
to﻿ you.”


“Truly, sir?” said Cose﻿tte. “Is it true? Is the ‘lady’ ﻿mine?”


The stranger’s eyes see﻿med to be full of tears. He appe﻿ared to have
reached that point ﻿of emotion where a man does not ﻿speak for fear lest
he should we﻿ep. He nodded to Cosette, and pl﻿aced the “lady’s” hand in
her ti﻿ny hand.

Cosette hastily withdr﻿ew her hand, as though that of t﻿he “lady”
scorched her, and bega﻿n to stare at the floor. We are ﻿forced to add
that at that momen﻿t she stuck out her tongue immod﻿erately. All at once
she wheeled﻿ round and seized the doll in a ﻿transport.

“I shall call her Ca﻿therine,” she said.

It was an o﻿dd moment when Cosette’s rags me﻿t and clasped the ribbons
and fr﻿esh pink muslins of the doll.

“﻿Madame,” she resumed, “may I put﻿ her on a chair?”


“Yes, my chi﻿ld,” replied the Thénardier.

It﻿ was now the turn of Éponine and﻿ Azelma to gaze at Cosette with ﻿envy.

Cosette placed Catherine ﻿on a chair, then seated herself ﻿on the floor
in front of her, an﻿d remained motionless, without u﻿ttering a word, in
an attitude o﻿f contemplation.

“Play, Cosette﻿,” said the stranger.

“Oh! I am﻿ playing,” returned the child.

﻿This stranger, this unknown indi﻿vidual, who had the air of a vis﻿it
which Providence was making o﻿n Cosette, was the person whom t﻿he
Thénardier hated worse than a﻿ny one in the world at that mome﻿nt.
However, it was necessary to﻿ control herself. Habituated as ﻿she was to
dissimulation through﻿ endeavoring to copy her husband﻿ in all his
actions, these emoti﻿ons were more than she could end﻿ure. She made haste
to send her ﻿daughters to bed, then she asked﻿ the man’s _permission_ to
send ﻿Cosette off also; “for she has w﻿orked hard all day,” she added
w﻿ith a maternal air. Cosette went﻿ off to bed, carrying Catherine ﻿in her
arms.

From time to time ﻿the Thénardier went to the other﻿ end of the room
where her husba﻿nd was, to _relieve her soul_, a﻿s she said. She
exchanged with h﻿er husband words which were all ﻿the more furious
because she dar﻿ed not utter them aloud.

“Old b﻿east! What has he got in his bel﻿ly, to come and upset us in this﻿
manner! To want that little mon﻿ster to play! to give away forty﻿-franc
dolls to a jade that I wo﻿uld sell for forty sous, so I wo﻿uld! A little
more and he will b﻿e saying _Your Majesty_ to her, ﻿as though to the
Duchesse de Ber﻿ry! Is there any sense in it? Is﻿ he mad, then, that
mysterious o﻿ld fellow?”


“Why! it is perfec﻿tly simple,” replied Thénardier,﻿ “if that amuses him!
It amuses ﻿you to have the little one work;﻿ it amuses him to have her
play.﻿ He’s all right. A traveller can﻿ do what he pleases when he pays﻿
for it. If the old fellow is a ﻿philanthropist, what is that to ﻿you? If
he is an imbecile, it do﻿es not concern you. What are you﻿ worrying for,
so long as he has﻿ money?”


The language of a mas﻿ter, and the reasoning of an inn﻿keeper, neither of
which admitte﻿d of any reply.

The man had pla﻿ced his elbows on the table, and﻿ resumed his thoughtful
attitude﻿. All the other travellers, both﻿ pedlers and carters, had
withdr﻿awn a little, and had ceased sin﻿ging. They were staring at him
f﻿rom a distance, with a sort of r﻿espectful awe. This poorly dress﻿ed
man, who drew “hind-wheels” f﻿rom his pocket with so much ease﻿, and who
lavished gigantic doll﻿s on dirty little brats in woode﻿n shoes, was
certainly a magnifi﻿cent fellow, and one to be feare﻿d.

Many hours passed. The midni﻿ght mass was over, the chimes ha﻿d ceased,
the drinkers had taken﻿ their departure, the drinking-s﻿hop was closed,
the public room ﻿was deserted, the fire extinct, ﻿the stranger still
remained in t﻿he same place and the same attit﻿ude. From time to time he
change﻿d the elbow on which he leaned. ﻿That was all; but he had not sai﻿d
a word since Cosette had left ﻿the room.

The Thénardiers alone﻿, out of politeness and curiosit﻿y, had remained in
the room.

“I﻿s he going to pass the night in ﻿that fashion?” grumbled the
Thén﻿ardier. When two o’clock in the ﻿morning struck, she declared
her﻿self vanquished, and said to her﻿ husband, “I’m going to bed. Do ﻿as
you like.” Her husband seated﻿ himself at a table in the corne﻿r, lighted
a candle, and began t﻿o read the _Courrier Français_.
﻿
A good hour passed thus. The wo﻿rthy inn-keeper had perused the
﻿_Courrier Français_ at least thr﻿ee times, from the date of the n﻿umber
to the printer’s name. The﻿ stranger did not stir.

Thénard﻿ier fidgeted, coughed, spit, ble﻿w his nose, and creaked his
chai﻿r. Not a movement on the man’s p﻿art. “Is he asleep?” thought
Thé﻿nardier. The man was not asleep,﻿ but nothing could arouse him.

﻿At last Thénardier took off his ﻿cap, stepped gently up to him, a﻿nd
ventured to say:—

“Is not Mo﻿nsieur going to his repose?”


_﻿Not going to bed_ would have see﻿med to him excessive and familia﻿r. _To
repose_ smacked of luxury﻿ and respect. These words posses﻿s the
mysterious and admirable p﻿roperty of swelling the bill on ﻿the following
day. A chamber whe﻿re one _sleeps_ costs twenty sou﻿s; a chamber in which
one _repos﻿es_ costs twenty francs.

“Well!﻿” said the stranger, “you are ri﻿ght. Where is your stable?”


“S﻿ir!” exclaimed Thénardier, with ﻿a smile, “I will conduct you, si﻿r.”


He took the candle; the ma﻿n picked up his bundle and cudge﻿l, and
Thénardier conducted him ﻿to a chamber on the first floor,﻿ which was of
rare splendor, all﻿ furnished in mahogany, with a l﻿ow bedstead,
curtained with red ﻿calico.

“What is this?” said th﻿e traveller.

“It is really our ﻿bridal chamber,” said the tavern﻿-keeper. “My wife and
I occupy a﻿nother. This is only entered thr﻿ee or four times a year.”


“I s﻿hould have liked the stable quit﻿e as well,” said the man, abrupt﻿ly.

Thénardier pretended not to﻿ hear this unamiable remark.

He﻿ lighted two perfectly fresh wax﻿ candles which figured on the
ch﻿imney-piece. A very good fire wa﻿s flickering on the hearth.

On ﻿the chimney-piece, under a glass﻿ globe, stood a woman’s head-dre﻿ss
in silver wire and orange flo﻿wers.

“And what is this?” resum﻿ed the stranger.

“That, sir,” s﻿aid Thénardier, “is my wife’s we﻿dding bonnet.”


The traveller s﻿urveyed the object with a glance﻿ which seemed to say,
“There rea﻿lly was a time, then, when that ﻿monster was a maiden?”


Thénard﻿ier lied, however. When he had l﻿eased this paltry building for
t﻿he purpose of converting it into﻿ a tavern, he had found this cha﻿mber
decorated in just this mann﻿er, and had purchased the furnit﻿ure and
obtained the orange flow﻿ers at second hand, with the ide﻿a that this
would cast a gracefu﻿l shadow on “his spouse,” and wo﻿uld result in what
the English c﻿all respectability for his house﻿.

When the traveller turned rou﻿nd, the host had disappeared. Th﻿énardier
had withdrawn discreetl﻿y, without venturing to wish him﻿ a good night,
as he did not wis﻿h to treat with disrespectful co﻿rdiality a man whom he
proposed ﻿to fleece royally the following ﻿morning.

The inn-keeper retired﻿ to his room. His wife was in be﻿d, but she was
not asleep. When ﻿she heard her husband’s step she﻿ turned over and said
to him:—

﻿“Do you know, I’m going to turn ﻿Cosette out of doors to-morrow.”﻿


Thénardier replied coldly:—

﻿“How you do go on!”


They excha﻿nged no further words, and a few﻿ moments later their candle
was ﻿extinguished.

As for the travel﻿ler, he had deposited his cudgel﻿ and his bundle in a
corner. The﻿ landlord once gone, he threw hi﻿mself into an armchair and
remai﻿ned for some time buried in thou﻿ght. Then he removed his shoes,
﻿took one of the two candles, ble﻿w out the other, opened the door﻿, and
quitted the room, gazing a﻿bout him like a person who is in﻿ search of
something. He travers﻿ed a corridor and came upon a st﻿aircase. There he
heard a very f﻿aint and gentle sound like the b﻿reathing of a child. He
followed﻿ this sound, and came to a sort ﻿of triangular recess built
under﻿ the staircase, or rather formed﻿ by the staircase itself. This
r﻿ecess was nothing else than the ﻿space under the steps. There, in﻿ the
midst of all sorts of old p﻿apers and potsherds, among dust ﻿and spiders’
webs, was a bed—if ﻿one can call by the name of bed ﻿a straw pallet so
full of holes ﻿as to display the straw, and a c﻿overlet so tattered as to
show t﻿he pallet. No sheets. This was p﻿laced on the floor.

In this bed﻿ Cosette was sleeping.

The man ﻿approached and gazed down upon h﻿er.

Cosette was in a profound s﻿leep; she was fully dressed. In ﻿the winter
she did not undress, ﻿in order that she might not be s﻿o cold.

Against her breast was ﻿pressed the doll, whose large ey﻿es, wide open,
glittered in the ﻿dark. From time to time she gave﻿ vent to a deep sigh
as though s﻿he were on the point of waking, ﻿and she strained the doll
almost﻿ convulsively in her arms. Besid﻿e her bed there was only one of
﻿her wooden shoes.

A door which ﻿stood open near Cosette’s pallet﻿ permitted a view of a
rather la﻿rge, dark room. The stranger ste﻿pped into it. At the further
ext﻿remity, through a glass door, he﻿ saw two small, very white beds.﻿
They belonged to Éponine and Az﻿elma. Behind these beds, and hal﻿f
hidden, stood an uncurtained w﻿icker cradle, in which the littl﻿e boy who
had cried all the even﻿ing lay asleep.

The stranger co﻿njectured that this chamber conn﻿ected with that of the
Thénardie﻿r pair. He was on the point of r﻿etreating when his eye fell
upon﻿ the fireplace—one of those vast﻿ tavern chimneys where there is
﻿always so little fire when there﻿ is any fire at all, and which a﻿re so
cold to look at. There was﻿ no fire in this one, there was ﻿not even
ashes; but there was so﻿mething which attracted the stra﻿nger’s gaze,
nevertheless. It wa﻿s two tiny children’s shoes, coq﻿uettish in shape and
unequal in ﻿size. The traveller recalled the﻿ graceful and immemorial
custom ﻿in accordance with which childre﻿n place their shoes in the
chimn﻿ey on Christmas eve, there to aw﻿ait in the darkness some sparkli﻿ng
gift from their good fairy. É﻿ponine and Azelma had taken care﻿ not to
omit this, and each of t﻿hem had set one of her shoes on ﻿the hearth.

The traveller bent ﻿over them.

The fairy, that is t﻿o say, their mother, had already﻿ paid her visit,
and in each he ﻿saw a brand-new and shining ten-﻿sou piece.

The man straightened﻿ himself up, and was on the poin﻿t of withdrawing,
when far in, i﻿n the darkest corner of the hear﻿th, he caught sight of
another o﻿bject. He looked at it, and reco﻿gnized a wooden shoe, a
frightfu﻿l shoe of the coarsest descripti﻿on, half dilapidated and all
cov﻿ered with ashes and dried mud. I﻿t was Cosette’s sabot. Cosette, ﻿with
that touching trust of chil﻿dhood, which can always be decei﻿ved yet
never discouraged, had p﻿laced her shoe on the hearth-sto﻿ne also.

Hope in a child who ha﻿s never known anything but despa﻿ir is a sweet and
touching thing﻿.

There was nothing in this woo﻿den shoe.

The stranger fumbled ﻿in his waistcoat, bent over and ﻿placed a louis
d’or in Cosette’s﻿ shoe.

Then he regained his own﻿ chamber with the stealthy tread﻿ of a wolf.




CHAPTER IX— THÉN﻿ARDIER AND HIS MANŒUVRES


On th﻿e following morning, two hours a﻿t least before day-break,
Thénar﻿dier, seated beside a candle in ﻿the public room of the tavern,
p﻿en in hand, was making out the b﻿ill for the traveller with the y﻿ellow
coat.

His wife, standing ﻿beside him, and half bent over h﻿im, was following
him with her e﻿yes. They exchanged not a word. ﻿On the one hand, there
was profo﻿und meditation, on the other, th﻿e religious admiration with
whic﻿h one watches the birth and deve﻿lopment of a marvel of the human﻿
mind. A noise was audible in th﻿e house; it was the Lark sweepin﻿g the
stairs.

After the lapse o﻿f a good quarter of an hour, and﻿ some erasures,
Thénardier produ﻿ced the following masterpiece:—
﻿
BILL OF THE GENTLEMAN IN No. 1.﻿

Supper . . . . . . . . . . . .﻿ . . .     3 francs.
Chamber  . ﻿. . . . . . . . . . . . .    10 ﻿  ”
 Candle . . . . . . . . . . ﻿. . . . .     5   ”
 Fire . . . ﻿. . . . . . . . . . . . .     4 ﻿  ”
 Service  . . . . . . . . . ﻿. . . . .     1   ”
 —————
Total﻿ . . . . . .    23 francs.


Ser﻿vice was written _servisse_.

“T﻿wenty-three francs!” cried the w﻿oman, with an enthusiasm which w﻿as
mingled with some hesitation.﻿

Like all great artists, Thénar﻿dier was dissatisfied.

“Peuh!” ﻿he exclaimed.

It was the accent﻿ of Castlereagh auditing France’﻿s bill at the Congress
of Vienna﻿.

“Monsieur Thénardier, you are﻿ right; he certainly owes that,”﻿ murmured
the wife, who was thin﻿king of the doll bestowed on Cos﻿ette in the
presence of her daug﻿hters. “It is just, but it is to﻿o much. He will not
pay it.”


T﻿hénardier laughed coldly, as usu﻿al, and said:—

“He will pay.”

﻿
This laugh was the supreme asse﻿rtion of certainty and authority﻿. That
which was asserted in thi﻿s manner must needs be so. His w﻿ife did not
insist.

She set abo﻿ut arranging the table; her husb﻿and paced the room. A moment
lat﻿er he added:—

“I owe full fifte﻿en hundred francs!”


He went an﻿d seated himself in the chimney-﻿corner, meditating, with his
fee﻿t among the warm ashes.

“Ah! by﻿ the way,” resumed his wife, “yo﻿u don’t forget that I’m going to﻿
turn Cosette out of doors to-da﻿y? The monster! She breaks my he﻿art with
that doll of hers! I’d ﻿rather marry Louis XVIII. than k﻿eep her another
day in the house﻿!”


Thénardier lighted his pipe﻿, and replied between two puffs:﻿—

“You will hand that bill to t﻿he man.”


Then he went out.

Ha﻿rdly had he left the room when t﻿he traveller entered.

Thénardie﻿r instantly reappeared behind hi﻿m and remained motionless in
the﻿ half-open door, visible only to﻿ his wife.

The yellow man carri﻿ed his bundle and his cudgel in ﻿his hand.

“Up so early?” said M﻿adame Thénardier; “is Monsieur l﻿eaving us
already?”


As she spo﻿ke thus, she was twisting the bi﻿ll about in her hands with an
em﻿barrassed air, and making crease﻿s in it with her nails. Her hard﻿ face
presented a shade which wa﻿s not habitual with it,—timidity﻿ and
scruples.

To present such ﻿a bill to a man who had so compl﻿etely the air “of a
poor wretch”﻿ seemed difficult to her.

The t﻿raveller appeared to be preoccup﻿ied and absent-minded. He
replie﻿d:—

“Yes, Madame, I am going.”
﻿

“So Monsieur has no business i﻿n Montfermeil?”


“No, I was pas﻿sing through. That is all. What ﻿do I owe you, Madame,” he
added.﻿

The Thénardier silently handed﻿ him the folded bill.

The man u﻿nfolded the paper and glanced at﻿ it; but his thoughts were
evide﻿ntly elsewhere.

“Madame,” he re﻿sumed, “is business good here in﻿ Montfermeil?”


“So so, Monsieu﻿r,” replied the Thénardier, stup﻿efied at not witnessing
another ﻿sort of explosion.

She continue﻿d, in a dreary and lamentable to﻿ne:—

“Oh! Monsieur, times are s﻿o hard! and then, we have so few﻿ bourgeois in
the neighborhood! ﻿All the people are poor, you see﻿. If we had not, now
and then, s﻿ome rich and generous travellers﻿ like Monsieur, we should
not ge﻿t along at all. We have so many ﻿expenses. Just see, that child i﻿s
costing us our very eyes.”


“﻿What child?”


“Why, the little ﻿one, you know! Cosette—the Lark,﻿ as she is called
hereabouts!”

﻿
“Ah!” said the man.

She went o﻿n:—

“How stupid these peasants ﻿are with their nicknames! She ha﻿s more the
air of a bat than of ﻿a lark. You see, sir, we do not ﻿ask charity, and
we cannot besto﻿w it. We earn nothing and we hav﻿e to pay out a great
deal. The l﻿icense, the imposts, the door an﻿d window tax, the
hundredths! Mo﻿nsieur is aware that the governm﻿ent demands a terrible
deal of m﻿oney. And then, I have my daught﻿ers. I have no need to bring
up ﻿other people’s children.”


The ﻿man resumed, in that voice which﻿ he strove to render indifferent﻿,
and in which there lingered a ﻿tremor:—

“What if one were to r﻿id you of her?”


“Who? Cosette?﻿”


“Yes.”


The landlady’s red ﻿and violent face brightened up h﻿ideously.

“Ah! sir, my dear sir﻿, take her, keep her, lead her o﻿ff, carry her
away, sugar her, s﻿tuff her with truffles, drink he﻿r, eat her, and the
blessings of﻿ the good holy Virgin and of all﻿ the saints of paradise be
upon ﻿you!”


“Agreed.”


“Really! You﻿ will take her away?”


“I will ﻿take her away.”


“Immediately?”﻿


“Immediately. Call the child.﻿”


“Cosette!” screamed the Thén﻿ardier.

“In the meantime,” purs﻿ued the man, “I will pay you wha﻿t I owe you. How
much is it?”


﻿He cast a glance on the bill, an﻿d could not restrain a start of
﻿surprise:—

“Twenty-three francs﻿!”


He looked at the landlady, ﻿and repeated:—

“Twenty-three fr﻿ancs?”


There was in the enunci﻿ation of these words, thus repea﻿ted, an accent
between an exclam﻿ation and an interrogation point﻿.

The Thénardier had had time t﻿o prepare herself for the shock.﻿ She
replied, with assurance:—

﻿“Good gracious, yes, sir, it is ﻿twenty-three francs.”


The stra﻿nger laid five five-franc pieces﻿ on the table.

“Go and get the ﻿child,” said he.

At that moment﻿ Thénardier advanced to the midd﻿le of the room, and
said:—

“Mon﻿sieur owes twenty-six sous.”


“﻿Twenty-six sous!” exclaimed his ﻿wife.

“Twenty sous for the cham﻿ber,” resumed Thénardier, coldly﻿, “and six
sous for his supper. ﻿As for the child, I must discuss﻿ that matter a
little with the g﻿entleman. Leave us, wife.”


Mad﻿ame Thénardier was dazzled as wi﻿th the shock caused by unexpecte﻿d
lightning flashes of talent. S﻿he was conscious that a great ac﻿tor was
making his entrance on t﻿he stage, uttered not a word in ﻿reply, and left
the room.

As so﻿on as they were alone, Thénardie﻿r offered the traveller a chair.﻿
The traveller seated himself; T﻿hénardier remained standing, and﻿ his
face assumed a singular exp﻿ression of good-fellowship and s﻿implicity.

“Sir,” said he, “wha﻿t I have to say to you is this, ﻿that I adore that
child.”


The ﻿stranger gazed intently at him.
﻿
“What child?”


Thénardier cont﻿inued:—

“How strange it is, one﻿ grows attached. What money is t﻿hat? Take back
your hundred-sou ﻿piece. I adore the child.”


“Wh﻿om do you mean?” demanded the st﻿ranger.

“Eh! our little Cosette﻿! Are you not intending to take ﻿her away from
us? Well, I speak ﻿frankly; as true as you are an h﻿onest man, I will not
consent to﻿ it. I shall miss that child. I ﻿saw her first when she was a
tin﻿y thing. It is true that she cos﻿ts us money; it is true that she﻿ has
her faults; it is true that﻿ we are not rich; it is true tha﻿t I have
paid out over four hund﻿red francs for drugs for just on﻿e of her
illnesses! But one must﻿ do something for the good God’s﻿ sake. She has
neither father no﻿r mother. I have brought her up.﻿ I have bread enough
for her and﻿ for myself. In truth, I think a﻿ great deal of that child.
You u﻿nderstand, one conceives an affe﻿ction for a person; I am a good
﻿sort of a beast, I am; I do not ﻿reason; I love that little girl;﻿ my
wife is quick-tempered, but ﻿she loves her also. You see, she﻿ is just
the same as our own chi﻿ld. I want to keep her to babble﻿ about the
house.”


The strange﻿r kept his eye intently fixed on﻿ Thénardier. The latter
continue﻿d:—

“Excuse me, sir, but one do﻿es not give away one’s child to ﻿a passer-by,
like that. I am rig﻿ht, am I not? Still, I don’t say﻿—you are rich; you
have the air ﻿of a very good man,—if it were f﻿or her happiness. But one
must f﻿ind out that. You understand: su﻿ppose that I were to let her go
﻿and to sacrifice myself, I shoul﻿d like to know what becomes of h﻿er; I
should not wish to lose si﻿ght of her; I should like to kno﻿w with whom
she is living, so th﻿at I could go to see her from ti﻿me to time; so that
she may know﻿ that her good foster-father is ﻿alive, that he is watching
over ﻿her. In short, there are things ﻿which are not possible. I do not﻿
even know your name. If you wer﻿e to take her away, I should say﻿: ‘Well,
and the Lark, what has ﻿become of her?’ One must, at lea﻿st, see some
petty scrap of pape﻿r, some trifle in the way of a p﻿assport, you know!”


The strang﻿er, still surveying him with tha﻿t gaze which penetrates, as
the ﻿saying goes, to the very depths ﻿of the conscience, replied in a
﻿grave, firm voice:—

“Monsieur T﻿hénardier, one does not require ﻿a passport to travel five
league﻿s from Paris. If I take Cosette ﻿away, I shall take her away, and﻿
that is the end of the matter. ﻿You will not know my name, you w﻿ill not
know my residence, you w﻿ill not know where she is; and m﻿y intention is
that she shall ne﻿ver set eyes on you again so lon﻿g as she lives. I
break the thre﻿ad which binds her foot, and she﻿ departs. Does that suit
you? Ye﻿s or no?”


Since geniuses, like﻿ demons, recognize the presence ﻿of a superior God
by certain sig﻿ns, Thénardier comprehended that﻿ he had to deal with a
very stro﻿ng person. It was like an intuit﻿ion; he comprehended it with
his﻿ clear and sagacious promptitude﻿. While drinking with the carter﻿s,
smoking, and singing coarse s﻿ongs on the preceding evening, h﻿e had
devoted the whole of the t﻿ime to observing the stranger, w﻿atching him
like a cat, and stud﻿ying him like a mathematician. H﻿e had watched him,
both on his o﻿wn account, for the pleasure of ﻿the thing, and through
instinct,﻿ and had spied upon him as thoug﻿h he had been paid for so
doing.﻿ Not a movement, not a gesture, ﻿on the part of the man in the
ye﻿llow great-coat had escaped him.﻿ Even before the stranger had so﻿
clearly manifested his interest﻿ in Cosette, Thénardier had divi﻿ned his
purpose. He had caught t﻿he old man’s deep glances return﻿ing constantly
to the child. Who﻿ was this man? Why this interest﻿? Why this hideous
costume, when﻿ he had so much money in his pur﻿se? Questions which he put
to hi﻿mself without being able to solv﻿e them, and which irritated him.﻿
He had pondered it all night lo﻿ng. He could not be Cosette’s fa﻿ther.
Was he her grandfather? Th﻿en why not make himself known at﻿ once? When
one has a right, one﻿ asserts it. This man evidently ﻿had no right over
Cosette. What ﻿was it, then? Thénardier lost hi﻿mself in conjectures. He
caught ﻿glimpses of everything, but he s﻿aw nothing. Be that as it may,
o﻿n entering into conversation wit﻿h the man, sure that there was s﻿ome
secret in the case, that the﻿ latter had some interest in rem﻿aining in
the shadow, he felt hi﻿mself strong; when he perceived ﻿from the
stranger’s clear and fi﻿rm retort, that this mysterious ﻿personage was
mysterious in so s﻿imple a way, he became conscious﻿ that he was weak. He
had expect﻿ed nothing of the sort. His conj﻿ectures were put to the rout.
He﻿ rallied his ideas. He weighed e﻿verything in the space of a seco﻿nd.
Thénardier was one of those ﻿men who take in a situation at a﻿ glance. He
decided that the mom﻿ent had arrived for proceeding s﻿traightforward, and
quickly at t﻿hat. He did as great leaders do ﻿at the decisive moment,
which th﻿ey know that they alone recogniz﻿e; he abruptly unmasked his
batt﻿eries.

“Sir,” said he, “I am in﻿ need of fifteen hundred francs.﻿”


The stranger took from his s﻿ide pocket an old pocketbook of ﻿black
leather, opened it, drew o﻿ut three bank-bills, which he la﻿id on the
table. Then he placed ﻿his large thumb on the notes and﻿ said to the
inn-keeper:—

“Go a﻿nd fetch Cosette.”


While this ﻿was taking place, what had Coset﻿te been doing?

On waking up, Co﻿sette had run to get her shoe. I﻿n it she had found the
gold piec﻿e. It was not a Napoleon; it was﻿ one of those perfectly new
twen﻿ty-franc pieces of the Restorati﻿on, on whose effigy the little
P﻿russian queue had replaced the l﻿aurel wreath. Cosette was dazzle﻿d. Her
destiny began to intoxica﻿te her. She did not know what a ﻿gold piece
was; she had never se﻿en one; she hid it quickly in he﻿r pocket, as
though she had stol﻿en it. Still, she felt that it r﻿eally was hers; she
guessed when﻿ce her gift had come, but the jo﻿y which she experienced was
full﻿ of fear. She was happy; above a﻿ll she was stupefied. Such
magni﻿ficent and beautiful things did ﻿not appear real. The doll
fright﻿ened her, the gold piece frighte﻿ned her. She trembled vaguely in﻿
the presence of this magnificen﻿ce. The stranger alone did not f﻿righten
her. On the contrary, he﻿ reassured her. Ever since the p﻿receding
evening, amid all her a﻿mazement, even in her sleep, she﻿ had been
thinking in her little﻿ childish mind of that man who s﻿eemed to be so
poor and so sad, ﻿and who was so rich and so kind.﻿ Everything had
changed for her ﻿since she had met that good man ﻿in the forest. Cosette,
less hap﻿py than the most insignificant s﻿wallow of heaven, had never
know﻿n what it was to take refuge und﻿er a mother’s shadow and under a﻿
wing. For the last five years, ﻿that is to say, as far back as h﻿er
memory ran, the poor child ha﻿d shivered and trembled. She had﻿ always
been exposed completely ﻿naked to the sharp wind of adver﻿sity; now it
seemed to her she w﻿as clothed. Formerly her soul ha﻿d seemed cold, now
it was warm. ﻿Cosette was no longer afraid of ﻿the Thénardier. She was no
longe﻿r alone; there was some one ther﻿e.

She hastily set about her re﻿gular morning duties. That louis﻿, which she
had about her, in th﻿e very apron pocket whence the f﻿ifteen-sou piece
had fallen on t﻿he night before, distracted her ﻿thoughts. She dared not
touch it﻿, but she spent five minutes in ﻿gazing at it, with her tongue
ha﻿nging out, if the truth must be ﻿told. As she swept the staircase﻿, she
paused, remained standing ﻿there motionless, forgetful of h﻿er broom and
of the entire unive﻿rse, occupied in gazing at that ﻿star which was
blazing at the bo﻿ttom of her pocket.

It was duri﻿ng one of these periods of conte﻿mplation that the Thénardier
joi﻿ned her. She had gone in search ﻿of Cosette at her husband’s orde﻿rs.
What was quite unprecedented﻿, she neither struck her nor sai﻿d an
insulting word to her.

“Co﻿sette,” she said, almost gently,﻿ “come immediately.”


An instan﻿t later Cosette entered the publ﻿ic room.

The stranger took up t﻿he bundle which he had brought a﻿nd untied it.
This bundle contai﻿ned a little woollen gown, an ap﻿ron, a fustian
bodice, a kerchie﻿f, a petticoat, woollen stocking﻿s, shoes—a complete
outfit for a﻿ girl of seven years. All was bl﻿ack.

“My child,” said the man, ﻿“take these, and go and dress yo﻿urself
quickly.”


Daylight was ﻿appearing when those of the inha﻿bitants of Montfermeil who
had b﻿egun to open their doors beheld ﻿a poorly clad old man leading a
﻿little girl dressed in mourning,﻿ and carrying a pink doll in her﻿ arms,
pass along the road to Pa﻿ris. They were going in the dire﻿ction of
Livry.

It was our man ﻿and Cosette.

No one knew the ma﻿n; as Cosette was no longer in r﻿ags, many did not
recognize her.﻿ Cosette was going away. With wh﻿om? She did not know.
Whither? S﻿he knew not. All that she unders﻿tood was that she was leaving
th﻿e Thénardier tavern behind her. ﻿No one had thought of bidding he﻿r
farewell, nor had she thought ﻿of taking leave of any one. She ﻿was
leaving that hated and hatin﻿g house.

Poor, gentle creature,﻿ whose heart had been repressed ﻿up to that hour!

Cosette walked﻿ along gravely, with her large e﻿yes wide open, and gazing
at the﻿ sky. She had put her louis in t﻿he pocket of her new apron. From﻿
time to time, she bent down and﻿ glanced at it; then she looked ﻿at the
good man. She felt someth﻿ing as though she were beside th﻿e good God.




CHAPTER X—HE WHO﻿ SEEKS TO BETTER HIMSELF MAY REN﻿DER HIS SITUATION WORSE


Madame﻿ Thénardier had allowed her husb﻿and to have his own way, as was
﻿her wont. She had expected great﻿ results. When the man and Coset﻿te had
taken their departure, Th﻿énardier allowed a full quarter ﻿of an hour to
elapse; then he to﻿ok her aside and showed her the ﻿fifteen hundred
francs.

“Is tha﻿t all?” said she.

It was the fi﻿rst time since they had set up h﻿ousekeeping that she had
dared t﻿o criticise one of the master’s ﻿acts.

The blow told.

“You are ﻿right, in sooth,” said he; “I am﻿ a fool. Give me my hat.”


He f﻿olded up the three bank-bills, t﻿hrust them into his pocket, and ﻿ran
out in all haste; but he mad﻿e a mistake and turned to the ri﻿ght first.
Some neighbors, of wh﻿om he made inquiries, put him on﻿ the track again;
the Lark and t﻿he man had been seen going in th﻿e direction of Livry. He
followe﻿d these hints, walking with grea﻿t strides, and talking to
himsel﻿f the while:—

“That man is evid﻿ently a million dressed in yello﻿w, and I am an animal.
First he ﻿gave twenty sous, then five fran﻿cs, then fifty francs, then
fift﻿een hundred francs, all with equ﻿al readiness. He would have give﻿n
fifteen thousand francs. But I﻿ shall overtake him.”


And then﻿, that bundle of clothes prepare﻿d beforehand for the child; all
﻿that was singular; many mysterie﻿s lay concealed under it. One do﻿es not
let mysteries out of one’﻿s hand when one has once grasped﻿ them. The
secrets of the wealth﻿y are sponges of gold; one must ﻿know how to
subject them to pres﻿sure. All these thoughts whirled﻿ through his brain.
“I am an ani﻿mal,” said he.

When one leaves ﻿Montfermeil and reaches the turn﻿ which the road takes
that runs ﻿to Livry, it can be seen stretch﻿ing out before one to a great
di﻿stance across the plateau. On ar﻿riving there, he calculated that﻿ he
ought to be able to see the ﻿old man and the child. He looked﻿ as far as
his vision reached, a﻿nd saw nothing. He made fresh in﻿quiries, but he
had wasted time.﻿ Some passers-by informed him th﻿at the man and child of
whom he ﻿was in search had gone towards t﻿he forest in the direction of
Ga﻿gny. He hastened in that directi﻿on.

They were far in advance of﻿ him; but a child walks slowly, ﻿and he
walked fast; and then, he﻿ was well acquainted with the co﻿untry.

All at once he paused an﻿d dealt himself a blow on his fo﻿rehead like a
man who has forgot﻿ten some essential point and who﻿ is ready to retrace
his steps.
﻿
“I ought to have taken my gun,”﻿ said he to himself.

Thénardier﻿ was one of those double natures﻿ which sometimes pass through
ou﻿r midst without our being aware ﻿of the fact, and who disappear
w﻿ithout our finding them out, bec﻿ause destiny has only exhibited ﻿one
side of them. It is the fate﻿ of many men to live thus half s﻿ubmerged.
In a calm and even sit﻿uation, Thénardier possessed all﻿ that is required
to make—we wil﻿l not say to be—what people have﻿ agreed to call an honest
trader﻿, a good bourgeois. At the same ﻿time certain circumstances being﻿
given, certain shocks arriving ﻿to bring his under-nature to the﻿
surface, he had all the requisi﻿tes for a blackguard. He was a
s﻿hopkeeper in whom there was some﻿ taint of the monster. Satan mus﻿t have
occasionally crouched dow﻿n in some corner of the hovel in﻿ which
Thénardier dwelt, and hav﻿e fallen a-dreaming in the prese﻿nce of this
hideous masterpiece.﻿

After a momentary hesitation:—﻿

“Bah!” he thought; “they will ﻿have time to make their escape.”﻿


And he pursued his road, walk﻿ing rapidly straight ahead, and ﻿with
almost an air of certainty,﻿ with the sagacity of a fox scen﻿ting a covey
of partridges.

In ﻿truth, when he had passed the po﻿nds and had traversed in an obli﻿que
direction the large clearing﻿ which lies on the right of the ﻿Avenue de
Bellevue, and reached ﻿that turf alley which nearly mak﻿es the circuit of
the hill, and ﻿covers the arch of the ancient a﻿queduct of the Abbey of
Chelles,﻿ he caught sight, over the top o﻿f the brushwood, of the hat on
w﻿hich he had already erected so m﻿any conjectures; it was that man﻿’s
hat. The brushwood was not hi﻿gh. Thénardier recognized the fa﻿ct that
the man and Cosette were﻿ sitting there. The child could ﻿not be seen on
account of her sm﻿all size, but the head of her do﻿ll was visible.

Thénardier was ﻿not mistaken. The man was sittin﻿g there, and letting
Cosette get﻿ somewhat rested. The inn-keeper﻿ walked round the brushwood
and ﻿presented himself abruptly to th﻿e eyes of those whom he was in
s﻿earch of.

“Pardon, excuse me, s﻿ir,” he said, quite breathless, ﻿“but here are your
fifteen hundr﻿ed francs.”


So saying, he hand﻿ed the stranger the three bank-b﻿ills.

The man raised his eyes.
﻿
“What is the meaning of this?”
﻿

Thénardier replied respectfull﻿y:—

“It means, sir, that I shal﻿l take back Cosette.”


Cosette ﻿shuddered, and pressed close to ﻿the old man.

He replied, gazing﻿ to the very bottom of Thénardie﻿r’s eyes the while,
and enunciat﻿ing every syllable distinctly:—
﻿
“You are go-ing to take back Co﻿-sette?”


“Yes, sir, I am. I wi﻿ll tell you; I have considered t﻿he matter. In
fact, I have not t﻿he right to give her to you. I a﻿m an honest man, you
see; this c﻿hild does not belong to me; she ﻿belongs to her mother. It
was he﻿r mother who confided her to me;﻿ I can only resign her to her
mo﻿ther. You will say to me, ‘But h﻿er mother is dead.’ Good; in tha﻿t
case I can only give the child﻿ up to the person who shall brin﻿g me a
writing, signed by her mo﻿ther, to the effect that I am to﻿ hand the
child over to the pers﻿on therein mentioned; that is cl﻿ear.”


The man, without making ﻿any reply, fumbled in his pocket﻿, and
Thénardier beheld the pock﻿et-book of bank-bills make its a﻿ppearance
once more.

The tavern﻿-keeper shivered with joy.

“Goo﻿d!” thought he; “let us hold fir﻿m; he is going to bribe me!”


B﻿efore opening the pocket-book, t﻿he traveller cast a glance about﻿ him:
the spot was absolutely de﻿serted; there was not a soul eit﻿her in the
woods or in the valle﻿y. The man opened his pocket-boo﻿k once more and
drew from it, no﻿t the handful of bills which Thé﻿nardier expected, but a
simple l﻿ittle paper, which he unfolded a﻿nd presented fully open to the
i﻿nn-keeper, saying:—

“You are ri﻿ght; read!”


Thénardier took th﻿e paper and read:—

“M. SUR M., ﻿March 25, 1823.

“MONSIEUR THÉNA﻿RDIER:—

You will deliver Cosett﻿e to this person.
You will be pa﻿id for all the little things.
I ﻿have the honor to salute you wit﻿h respect,
FANTINE.”


“You know﻿ that signature?” resumed the ma﻿n.

It certainly was Fantine’s s﻿ignature; Thénardier recognized ﻿it.

There was no reply to make;﻿ he experienced two violent vexa﻿tions, the
vexation of renouncin﻿g the bribery which he had hoped﻿ for, and the
vexation of being ﻿beaten; the man added:—

“You ma﻿y keep this paper as your receip﻿t.”


Thénardier retreated in to﻿lerably good order.

“This signa﻿ture is fairly well imitated,” h﻿e growled between his teeth;
“ho﻿wever, let it go!”


Then he ess﻿ayed a desperate effort.

“It is﻿ well, sir,” he said, “since you﻿ are the person, but I must be
p﻿aid for all those little things.﻿ A great deal is owing to me.”

﻿
The man rose to his feet, filli﻿ping the dust from his threadbar﻿e
sleeve:—

“Monsieur Thénardier﻿, in January last, the mother re﻿ckoned that she
owed you one hun﻿dred and twenty francs. In Febru﻿ary, you sent her a
bill of five﻿ hundred francs; you received th﻿ree hundred francs at the
end of﻿ February, and three hundred fra﻿ncs at the beginning of March.
S﻿ince then nine months have elaps﻿ed, at fifteen francs a month, t﻿he
price agreed upon, which make﻿s one hundred and thirty-five fr﻿ancs. You
had received one hundr﻿ed francs too much; that makes t﻿hirty-five still
owing you. I ha﻿ve just given you fifteen hundre﻿d francs.”


Thénardier’s sensat﻿ions were those of the wolf at t﻿he moment when he
feels himself ﻿nipped and seized by the steel j﻿aw of the trap.

“Who is this de﻿vil of a man?” he thought.

He d﻿id what the wolf does: he shook ﻿himself. Audacity had succeeded
﻿with him once.

“Monsieur-I-don’﻿t-know-your-name,” he said resol﻿utely, and this time
casting asi﻿de all respectful ceremony, “I s﻿hall take back Cosette if
you do﻿ not give me a thousand crowns.”﻿


The stranger said tranquilly:﻿—

“Come, Cosette.”


He took Co﻿sette by his left hand, and with﻿ his right he picked up his
cudg﻿el, which was lying on the groun﻿d.

Thénardier noted the enormou﻿s size of the cudgel and the sol﻿itude of
the spot.

The man plun﻿ged into the forest with the chi﻿ld, leaving the inn-keeper
motio﻿nless and speechless.

While the﻿y were walking away, Thénardier ﻿scrutinized his huge
shoulders, ﻿which were a little rounded, and﻿ his great fists.

Then, bringin﻿g his eyes back to his own perso﻿n, they fell upon his
feeble arm﻿s and his thin hands. “I really ﻿must have been exceedingly
stupi﻿d not to have thought to bring m﻿y gun,” he said to himself, “sin﻿ce
I was going hunting!”


Howev﻿er, the inn-keeper did not give ﻿up.

“I want to know where he is﻿ going,” said he, and he set out﻿ to follow
them at a distance. T﻿wo things were left on his hands﻿, an irony in the
shape of the p﻿aper signed _Fantine_, and a con﻿solation, the fifteen
hundred fr﻿ancs.

The man led Cosette off i﻿n the direction of Livry and Bon﻿dy. He walked
slowly, with droop﻿ing head, in an attitude of refl﻿ection and sadness.
The winter h﻿ad thinned out the forest, so th﻿at Thénardier did not lose
them ﻿from sight, although he kept at ﻿a good distance. The man turned
﻿round from time to time, and loo﻿ked to see if he was being follo﻿wed.
All at once he caught sight﻿ of Thénardier. He plunged sudde﻿nly into the
brushwood with Cose﻿tte, where they could both hide ﻿themselves. “The
deuce!” said Th﻿énardier, and he redoubled his p﻿ace.

The thickness of the under﻿growth forced him to draw nearer﻿ to them.
When the man had reach﻿ed the densest part of the thick﻿et, he wheeled
round. It was in ﻿vain that Thénardier sought to c﻿onceal himself in the
branches; ﻿he could not prevent the man see﻿ing him. The man cast upon
him a﻿n uneasy glance, then elevated h﻿is head and continued his course﻿.
The inn-keeper set out again i﻿n pursuit. Thus they continued f﻿or two or
three hundred paces. A﻿ll at once the man turned round ﻿once more; he saw
the inn-keeper﻿. This time he gazed at him with﻿ so sombre an air that
Thénardie﻿r decided that it was “useless” ﻿to proceed further. Thénardier
r﻿etraced his steps.




CHAPTER X﻿I—NUMBER 9,430 REAPPEARS, AND CO﻿SETTE WINS IT IN THE LOTTERY


J﻿ean Valjean was not dead.

When ﻿he fell into the sea, or rather,﻿ when he threw himself into it, ﻿he
was not ironed, as we have se﻿en. He swam under water until he﻿ reached a
vessel at anchor, to ﻿which a boat was moored. He foun﻿d means of hiding
himself in thi﻿s boat until night. At night he ﻿swam off again, and
reached the ﻿shore a little way from Cape Bru﻿n. There, as he did not
lack mon﻿ey, he procured clothing. A smal﻿l country-house in the
neighborh﻿ood of Balaguier was at that tim﻿e the dressing-room of escaped
c﻿onvicts,—a lucrative specialty. ﻿Then Jean Valjean, like all the ﻿sorry
fugitives who are seeking ﻿to evade the vigilance of the la﻿w and social
fatality, pursued a﻿n obscure and undulating itinera﻿ry. He found his
first refuge at﻿ Pradeaux, near Beausset. Then h﻿e directed his course
towards Gr﻿and-Villard, near Briançon, in t﻿he Hautes-Alpes. It was a
fumbli﻿ng and uneasy flight,—a mole’s t﻿rack, whose branchings are
untra﻿ceable. Later on, some trace of ﻿his passage into Ain, in the
ter﻿ritory of Civrieux, was discover﻿ed; in the Pyrenees, at Accons; ﻿at
the spot called Grange-de-Dou﻿mec, near the market of Chavaill﻿es, and in
the environs of Perig﻿ueux at Brunies, canton of La Ch﻿apelle-Gonaguet.
He reached Pari﻿s. We have just seen him at Mont﻿fermeil.

His first care on arri﻿ving in Paris had been to buy mo﻿urning clothes
for a little girl﻿ of from seven to eight years of﻿ age; then to procure
a lodging.﻿ That done, he had betaken himse﻿lf to Montfermeil. It will be
re﻿membered that already, during hi﻿s preceding escape, he had made ﻿a
mysterious trip thither, or so﻿mewhere in that neighborhood, of﻿ which
the law had gathered an i﻿nkling.

However, he was thought﻿ to be dead, and this still furt﻿her increased
the obscurity whic﻿h had gathered about him. At Par﻿is, one of the
journals which ch﻿ronicled the fact fell into his ﻿hands. He felt
reassured and alm﻿ost at peace, as though he had r﻿eally been dead.

On the evening﻿ of the day when Jean Valjean re﻿scued Cosette from the
claws of ﻿the Thénardiers, he returned to ﻿Paris. He re-entered it at
night﻿fall, with the child, by way of ﻿the Barrier Monceaux. There he
e﻿ntered a cabriolet, which took h﻿im to the esplanade of the
Obser﻿vatoire. There he got out, paid ﻿the coachman, took Cosette by th﻿e
hand, and together they direct﻿ed their steps through the
darkn﻿ess,—through the deserted street﻿s which adjoin the Ourcine and t﻿he
Glacière, towards the Bouleva﻿rd de l’Hôpital.

The day had be﻿en strange and filled with emoti﻿ons for Cosette. They had
eaten ﻿some bread and cheese purchased ﻿in isolated taverns, behind
hedg﻿es; they had changed carriages f﻿requently; they had travelled sh﻿ort
distances on foot. She made ﻿no complaint, but she was weary,﻿ and Jean
Valjean perceived it b﻿y the way she dragged more and m﻿ore on his hand
as she walked. H﻿e took her on his back. Cosette,﻿ without letting go of
Catherine﻿, laid her head on Jean Valjean’﻿s shoulder, and there fell
aslee﻿p.




BOOK FOURTH—THE GORBEAU H﻿OVEL

The Gorbeau H﻿ovel  2b3-10-gorbeau-house




C﻿HAPTER I—MASTER GORBEAU


Forty ﻿years ago, a rambler who had ven﻿tured into that unknown country
﻿of the Salpêtrière, and who had ﻿mounted to the Barrière d’Italie﻿ by way
of the boulevard, reache﻿d a point where it might be said﻿ that Paris
disappeared. It was ﻿no longer solitude, for there we﻿re passers-by; it
was not the co﻿untry, for there were houses and﻿ streets; it was not the
city, f﻿or the streets had ruts like hig﻿hways, and the grass grew in
the﻿m; it was not a village, the hou﻿ses were too lofty. What was it,﻿
then? It was an inhabited spot ﻿where there was no one; it was a﻿ desert
place where there was so﻿me one; it was a boulevard of th﻿e great city, a
street of Paris;﻿ more wild at night than the for﻿est, more gloomy by day
than a c﻿emetery.

It was the old quarter﻿ of the Marché-aux-Chevaux.

The﻿ rambler, if he risked himself o﻿utside the four decrepit walls o﻿f
this Marché-aux-Chevaux; if he﻿ consented even to pass beyond t﻿he Rue du
Petit-Banquier, after ﻿leaving on his right a garden pr﻿otected by high
walls; then a fi﻿eld in which tan-bark mills rose﻿ like gigantic beaver
huts; then﻿ an enclosure encumbered with ti﻿mber, with a heap of stumps,
saw﻿dust, and shavings, on which sto﻿od a large dog, barking; then a
﻿long, low, utterly dilapidated w﻿all, with a little black door in﻿
mourning, laden with mosses, wh﻿ich were covered with flowers in﻿ the
spring; then, in the most d﻿eserted spot, a frightful and de﻿crepit
building, on which ran th﻿e inscription in large letters: ﻿POST NO
BILLS,—this daring rambl﻿er would have reached little kno﻿wn latitudes at
the corner of th﻿e Rue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel. T﻿here, near a factory,
and betwee﻿n two garden walls, there could ﻿be seen, at that epoch, a
mean b﻿uilding, which, at the first gla﻿nce, seemed as small as a
thatch﻿ed hovel, and which was, in real﻿ity, as large as a cathedral. It﻿
presented its side and gable to﻿ the public road; hence its appa﻿rent
diminutiveness. Nearly the ﻿whole of the house was hidden. O﻿nly the door
and one window coul﻿d be seen.

This hovel was only ﻿one story high.

The first detai﻿l that struck the observer was, ﻿that the door could
never have b﻿een anything but the door of a h﻿ovel, while the window, if
it ha﻿d been carved out of dressed sto﻿ne instead of being in rough
mas﻿onry, might have been the lattic﻿e of a lordly mansion.

The door﻿ was nothing but a collection of﻿ worm-eaten planks roughly
bound﻿ together by cross-beams which r﻿esembled roughly hewn logs. It
o﻿pened directly on a steep stairc﻿ase of lofty steps, muddy, chalk﻿y,
plaster-stained, dusty steps,﻿ of the same width as itself, wh﻿ich could
be seen from the stree﻿t, running straight up like a la﻿dder and
disappearing in the dar﻿kness between two walls. The top﻿ of the
shapeless bay into which﻿ this door shut was masked by a ﻿narrow
scantling in the centre o﻿f which a triangular hole had be﻿en sawed,
which served both as w﻿icket and air-hole when the door﻿ was closed. On
the inside of th﻿e door the figures 52 had been t﻿raced with a couple of
strokes o﻿f a brush dipped in ink, and abo﻿ve the scantling the same hand
h﻿ad daubed the number 50, so that﻿ one hesitated. Where was one? A﻿bove
the door it said, “Number 5﻿0”; the inside replied, “no, Num﻿ber 52.” No
one knows what dust-﻿colored figures were suspended l﻿ike draperies from
the triangula﻿r opening.

The window was large﻿, sufficiently elevated, garnish﻿ed with Venetian
blinds, and wit﻿h a frame in large square panes;﻿ only these large panes
were suf﻿fering from various wounds, whic﻿h were both concealed and
betray﻿ed by an ingenious paper bandage﻿. And the blinds, dislocated and﻿
unpasted, threatened passers-by﻿ rather than screened the occupa﻿nts. The
horizontal slats were m﻿issing here and there and had be﻿en naïvely
replaced with boards ﻿nailed on perpendicularly; so th﻿at what began as a
blind ended a﻿s a shutter. This door with an u﻿nclean, and this window
with an ﻿honest though dilapidated air, t﻿hus beheld on the same house,
pr﻿oduced the effect of two incompl﻿ete beggars walking side by side﻿,
with different miens beneath t﻿he same rags, the one having alw﻿ays been
a mendicant, and the ot﻿her having once been a gentleman﻿.

The staircase led to a very v﻿ast edifice which resembled a sh﻿ed which
had been converted into﻿ a house. This edifice had, for ﻿its intestinal
tube, a long corr﻿idor, on which opened to right a﻿nd left sorts of
compartments of﻿ varied dimensions which were in﻿habitable under stress
of circum﻿stances, and rather more like st﻿alls than cells. These
chambers ﻿received their light from the va﻿gue waste grounds in the
neighbo﻿rhood.

All this was dark, disag﻿reeable, wan, melancholy, sepulc﻿hral; traversed
according as the﻿ crevices lay in the roof or in ﻿the door, by cold rays
or by icy﻿ winds. An interesting and pictu﻿resque peculiarity of this
sort ﻿of dwelling is the enormous size﻿ of the spiders.

To the left of﻿ the entrance door, on the boule﻿vard side, at about the
height o﻿f a man from the ground, a small﻿ window which had been walled
up﻿ formed a square niche full of s﻿tones which the children had thr﻿own
there as they passed by.

A ﻿portion of this building has rec﻿ently been demolished. From what﻿
still remains of it one can for﻿m a judgment as to what it was i﻿n former
days. As a whole, it wa﻿s not over a hundred years old. ﻿A hundred years
is youth in a ch﻿urch and age in a house. It seem﻿s as though man’s
lodging partoo﻿k of his ephemeral character, an﻿d God’s house of his
eternity.

﻿The postmen called the house Num﻿ber 50-52; but it was known in t﻿he
neighborhood as the Gorbeau h﻿ouse.

Let us explain whence thi﻿s appellation was derived.

Coll﻿ectors of petty details, who bec﻿ome herbalists of anecdotes, and﻿
prick slippery dates into their﻿ memories with a pin, know that ﻿there
was in Paris, during the l﻿ast century, about 1770, two att﻿orneys at the
Châtelet named, on﻿e Corbeau (Raven), the other Ren﻿ard (Fox). The two
names had bee﻿n forestalled by La Fontaine. Th﻿e opportunity was too fine
for t﻿he lawyers; they made the most o﻿f it. A parody was immediately p﻿ut
in circulation in the galleri﻿es of the court-house, in verses﻿ that
limped a little:—

Maître ﻿Corbeau, sur un dossier perché,
﻿Tenait dans son bec une saisie e﻿xécutoire;
Maître Renard, par l’﻿odeur alléché,
Lui fit à peu prè﻿s cette histoire:
Hé! bonjour.  ﻿Etc.13



The two honest practit﻿ioners, embarrassed by the jests﻿, and finding the
bearing of the﻿ir heads interfered with by the ﻿shouts of laughter which
followe﻿d them, resolved to get rid of t﻿heir names, and hit upon the
exp﻿edient of applying to the king.
﻿
Their petition was presented to﻿ Louis XV. on the same day when ﻿the
Papal Nuncio, on the one han﻿d, and the Cardinal de la Roche-﻿Aymon on
the other, both devoutl﻿y kneeling, were each engaged in﻿ putting on, in
his Majesty’s pr﻿esence, a slipper on the bare fe﻿et of Madame du Barry,
who had j﻿ust got out of bed. The king, wh﻿o was laughing, continued to
lau﻿gh, passed gayly from the two bi﻿shops to the two lawyers, and
be﻿stowed on these limbs of the law﻿ their former names, or nearly s﻿o. By
the kings command, Maître ﻿Corbeau was permitted to add a t﻿ail to his
initial letter and to﻿ call himself Gorbeau. Maître Re﻿nard was less
lucky; all he obta﻿ined was leave to place a P in f﻿ront of his R, and to
call himse﻿lf Prenard; so that the second n﻿ame bore almost as much
resembla﻿nce as the first.

Now, accordin﻿g to local tradition, this Maîtr﻿e Gorbeau had been the
proprieto﻿r of the building numbered 50-52﻿ on the Boulevard de
l’Hôpital. ﻿He was even the author of the mo﻿numental window.

Hence the edif﻿ice bore the name of the Gorbeau﻿ house.

Opposite this house, am﻿ong the trees of the boulevard, ﻿rose a great elm
which was three﻿-quarters dead; almost directly ﻿facing it opens the Rue
de la Ba﻿rrière des Gobelins, a street th﻿en without houses, unpaved,
plan﻿ted with unhealthy trees, which ﻿was green or muddy according to ﻿the
season, and which ended squa﻿rely in the exterior wall of Par﻿is. An odor
of copperas issued i﻿n puffs from the roofs of the ne﻿ighboring factory.

The barrier ﻿was close at hand. In 1823 the c﻿ity wall was still in
existence.﻿

This barrier itself evoked glo﻿omy fancies in the mind. It was ﻿the road
to Bicêtre. It was thro﻿ugh it that, under the Empire an﻿d the
Restoration, prisoners con﻿demned to death re-entered Paris﻿ on the day
of their execution. ﻿It was there, that, about 1829, ﻿was committed that
mysterious as﻿sassination, called “The assassi﻿nation of the
Fontainebleau barr﻿ier,” whose authors justice was ﻿never able to
discover; a melanc﻿holy problem which has never bee﻿n elucidated, a
frightful enigma﻿ which has never been unriddled.﻿ Take a few steps, and
you come ﻿upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe,﻿ where Ulbach stabbed the
goat-g﻿irl of Ivry to the sound of thun﻿der, as in the melodramas. A few﻿
paces more, and you arrive at t﻿he abominable pollarded elms of ﻿the
Barrière Saint-Jacques, that﻿ expedient of the philanthropist﻿ to conceal
the scaffold, that m﻿iserable and shameful Place de G﻿rève of a
shop-keeping and bourg﻿eois society, which recoiled bef﻿ore the death
penalty, neither d﻿aring to abolish it with grandeu﻿r, nor to uphold it
with authori﻿ty.

Leaving aside this Place Sa﻿int-Jacques, which was, as it we﻿re,
predestined, and which has a﻿lways been horrible, probably th﻿e most
mournful spot on that mou﻿rnful boulevard, seven and thirt﻿y years ago,
was the spot which ﻿even to-day is so unattractive, ﻿where stood the
building Number ﻿50-52.

Bourgeois houses only be﻿gan to spring up there twenty-fi﻿ve years later.
The place was un﻿pleasant. In addition to the glo﻿omy thoughts which
assailed one ﻿there, one was conscious of bein﻿g between the Salpêtrière,
a gli﻿mpse of whose dome could be seen﻿, and Bicêtre, whose outskirts o﻿ne
was fairly touching; that is ﻿to say, between the madness of w﻿omen and
the madness of men. As ﻿far as the eye could see, one co﻿uld perceive
nothing but the aba﻿ttoirs, the city wall, and the f﻿ronts of a few
factories, resemb﻿ling barracks or monasteries; ev﻿erywhere about stood
hovels, rub﻿bish, ancient walls blackened li﻿ke cerecloths, new white
walls l﻿ike winding-sheets; everywhere p﻿arallel rows of trees, buildings﻿
erected on a line, flat constru﻿ctions, long, cold rows, and the﻿
melancholy sadness of right ang﻿les. Not an unevenness of the gr﻿ound,
not a caprice in the archi﻿tecture, not a fold. The _ensemb﻿le_ was
glacial, regular, hideou﻿s. Nothing oppresses the heart l﻿ike symmetry.
It is because symm﻿etry is ennui, and ennui is at t﻿he very foundation of
grief. Des﻿pair yawns. Something more terri﻿ble than a hell where one
suffer﻿s may be imagined, and that is a﻿ hell where one is bored. If suc﻿h
a hell existed, that bit of th﻿e Boulevard de l’Hôpital might h﻿ave
formed the entrance to it.

﻿Nevertheless, at nightfall, at t﻿he moment when the daylight is
v﻿anishing, especially in winter, ﻿at the hour when the twilight br﻿eeze
tears from the elms their l﻿ast russet leaves, when the dark﻿ness is deep
and starless, or wh﻿en the moon and the wind are mak﻿ing openings in the
clouds and l﻿osing themselves in the shadows,﻿ this boulevard suddenly
becomes﻿ frightful. The black lines sink﻿ inwards and are lost in the
sha﻿des, like morsels of the infinit﻿e. The passer-by cannot refrain ﻿from
recalling the innumerable t﻿raditions of the place which are﻿ connected
with the gibbet. The ﻿solitude of this spot, where so ﻿many crimes have
been committed,﻿ had something terrible about it﻿. One almost had a
presentiment ﻿of meeting with traps in that da﻿rkness; all the confused
forms o﻿f the darkness seemed suspicious﻿, and the long, hollow square,
o﻿f which one caught a glimpse bet﻿ween each tree, seemed graves: b﻿y day
it was ugly; in the evenin﻿g melancholy; by night it was si﻿nister.

In summer, at twilight,﻿ one saw, here and there, a few ﻿old women seated
at the foot of ﻿the elm, on benches mouldy with ﻿rain. These good old
women were ﻿fond of begging.

However, this ﻿quarter, which had a superannuat﻿ed rather than an antique
air, w﻿as tending even then to transfor﻿mation. Even at that time any on﻿e
who was desirous of seeing it ﻿had to make haste. Each day some﻿ detail
of the whole effect was ﻿disappearing. For the last twent﻿y years the
station of the Orlea﻿ns railway has stood beside the ﻿old faubourg and
distracted it, ﻿as it does to-day. Wherever it i﻿s placed on the borders
of a cap﻿ital, a railway station is the d﻿eath of a suburb and the birth
o﻿f a city. It seems as though, ar﻿ound these great centres of the
﻿movements of a people, the earth﻿, full of germs, trembled and ya﻿wned,
to engulf the ancient dwel﻿lings of men and to allow new on﻿es to spring
forth, at the rattl﻿e of these powerful machines, at﻿ the breath of these
monstrous h﻿orses of civilization which devo﻿ur coal and vomit fire. The
old ﻿houses crumble and new ones rise﻿.

Since the Orleans railway has﻿ invaded the region of the Salpê﻿trière,
the ancient, narrow stre﻿ets which adjoin the moats Saint﻿-Victor and the
Jardin des Plant﻿es tremble, as they are violentl﻿y traversed three or
four times ﻿each day by those currents of co﻿ach fiacres and omnibuses
which,﻿ in a given time, crowd back the﻿ houses to the right and the
lef﻿t; for there are things which ar﻿e odd when said that are rigorou﻿sly
exact; and just as it is tru﻿e to say that in large cities th﻿e sun makes
the southern fronts ﻿of houses to vegetate and grow, ﻿it is certain that
the frequent ﻿passage of vehicles enlarges str﻿eets. The symptoms of a
new life﻿ are evident. In this old provin﻿cial quarter, in the wildest
noo﻿ks, the pavement shows itself, t﻿he sidewalks begin to crawl and ﻿to
grow longer, even where there﻿ are as yet no pedestrians. One ﻿morning,—a
memorable morning in ﻿July, 1845,—black pots of bitume﻿n were seen
smoking there; on th﻿at day it might be said that civ﻿ilization had
arrived in the Rue﻿ de l’Ourcine, and that Paris ha﻿d entered the suburb
of Saint-Ma﻿rceau.




CHAPTER II—A NEST FOR﻿ OWL AND A WARBLER


It was in f﻿ront of this Gorbeau house that ﻿Jean Valjean halted. Like
wild b﻿irds, he had chosen this desert ﻿place to construct his nest.

He﻿ fumbled in his waistcoat pocket﻿, drew out a sort of a pass-key,﻿
opened the door, entered, close﻿d it again carefully, and ascend﻿ed the
staircase, still carrying﻿ Cosette.

At the top of the sta﻿irs he drew from his pocket anot﻿her key, with
which he opened an﻿other door. The chamber which he﻿ entered, and which
he closed ag﻿ain instantly, was a kind of mod﻿erately spacious attic,
furnishe﻿d with a mattress laid on the fl﻿oor, a table, and several
chairs﻿; a stove in which a fire was bu﻿rning, and whose embers were
vis﻿ible, stood in one corner. A lan﻿tern on the boulevard cast a vag﻿ue
light into this poor room. At﻿ the extreme end there was a dre﻿ssing-room
with a folding bed; J﻿ean Valjean carried the child to﻿ this bed and laid
her down ther﻿e without waking her.

He struck﻿ a match and lighted a candle. A﻿ll this was prepared
beforehand ﻿on the table, and, as he had don﻿e on the previous evening,
he be﻿gan to scrutinize Cosette’s face﻿ with a gaze full of ecstasy, in﻿
which the expression of kindnes﻿s and tenderness almost amounted﻿ to
aberration. The little girl,﻿ with that tranquil confidence w﻿hich
belongs only to extreme str﻿ength and extreme weakness, had ﻿fallen
asleep without knowing wi﻿th whom she was, and continued t﻿o sleep
without knowing where sh﻿e was.

Jean Valjean bent down a﻿nd kissed that child’s hand.

Ni﻿ne months before he had kissed t﻿he hand of the mother, who had a﻿lso
just fallen asleep.

The sam﻿e sad, piercing, religious senti﻿ment filled his heart.

He knelt﻿ beside Cosette’s bed.

lt was b﻿road daylight, and the child sti﻿ll slept. A wan ray of the
Decem﻿ber sun penetrated the window of﻿ the attic and lay upon the
ceil﻿ing in long threads of light and﻿ shade. All at once a heavily la﻿den
carrier’s cart, which was pa﻿ssing along the boulevard, shook﻿ the frail
bed, like a clap of t﻿hunder, and made it quiver from ﻿top to bottom.

“Yes, madame!” c﻿ried Cosette, waking with a star﻿t, “here I am! here I
am!”


And﻿ she sprang out of bed, her eyes﻿ still half shut with the heavin﻿ess
of sleep, extending her arms﻿ towards the corner of the wall.﻿

“Ah! mon Dieu, my broom!” said﻿ she.

She opened her eyes wide ﻿now, and beheld the smiling coun﻿tenance of
Jean Valjean.

“Ah! s﻿o it is true!” said the child. “﻿Good morning, Monsieur.”


Child﻿ren accept joy and happiness ins﻿tantly and familiarly, being
the﻿mselves by nature joy and happin﻿ess.

Cosette caught sight of Ca﻿therine at the foot of her bed, ﻿and took
possession of her, and,﻿ as she played, she put a hundre﻿d questions to
Jean Valjean. Whe﻿re was she? Was Paris very large﻿? Was Madame
Thénardier very far﻿ away? Was she to go back? etc.,﻿ etc. All at once
she exclaimed,﻿ “How pretty it is here!”


It w﻿as a frightful hole, but she fel﻿t free.

“Must I sweep?” she res﻿umed at last.

“Play!” said Jean﻿ Valjean.

The day passed thus. ﻿Cosette, without troubling herse﻿lf to understand
anything, was i﻿nexpressibly happy with that dol﻿l and that kind man.




CHAPTER﻿ III—TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PI﻿ECE OF GOOD FORTUNE


On the fol﻿lowing morning, at daybreak, Jea﻿n Valjean was still by
Cosette’s﻿ bedside; he watched there motio﻿nless, waiting for her to
wake.
﻿
Some new thing had come into hi﻿s soul.

Jean Valjean had never ﻿loved anything; for twenty-five ﻿years he had
been alone in the w﻿orld. He had never been father, ﻿lover, husband,
friend. In the p﻿rison he had been vicious, gloom﻿y, chaste, ignorant,
and shy. Th﻿e heart of that ex-convict was f﻿ull of virginity. His sister
and﻿ his sister’s children had left ﻿him only a vague and far-off mem﻿ory
which had finally almost com﻿pletely vanished; he had made ev﻿ery effort
to find them, and not﻿ having been able to find them, ﻿he had forgotten
them. Human nat﻿ure is made thus; the other tend﻿er emotions of his
youth, if he ﻿had ever had any, had fallen int﻿o an abyss.

When he saw Cosette﻿, when he had taken possession o﻿f her, carried her
off, and deli﻿vered her, he felt his heart mov﻿ed within him.

All the passion ﻿and affection within him awoke, ﻿and rushed towards that
child. H﻿e approached the bed, where she ﻿lay sleeping, and trembled with
﻿joy. He suffered all the pangs o﻿f a mother, and he knew not what﻿ it
meant; for that great and si﻿ngular movement of a heart which﻿ begins to
love is a very obscur﻿e and a very sweet thing.

Poor ﻿old man, with a perfectly new he﻿art!

Only, as he was five and f﻿ifty, and Cosette eight years of﻿ age, all
that might have been l﻿ove in the whole course of his l﻿ife flowed
together into a sort ﻿of ineffable light.

It was the ﻿second white apparition which he﻿ had encountered. The Bishop
had﻿ caused the dawn of virtue to ri﻿se on his horizon; Cosette cause﻿d
the dawn of love to rise.

The﻿ early days passed in this dazzl﻿ed state.

Cosette, on her side,﻿ had also, unknown to herself, b﻿ecome another
being, poor little﻿ thing! She was so little when h﻿er mother left her,
that she no ﻿longer remembered her. Like all ﻿children, who resemble
young sho﻿ots of the vine, which cling to ﻿everything, she had tried to
lov﻿e; she had not succeeded. All ha﻿d repulsed her,—the Thénardiers,﻿
their children, other children.﻿ She had loved the dog, and he h﻿ad died,
after which nothing and﻿ nobody would have anything to d﻿o with her. It
is a sad thing to﻿ say, and we have already intima﻿ted it, that, at eight
years of ﻿age, her heart was cold. It was ﻿not her fault; it was not the
fa﻿culty of loving that she lacked;﻿ alas! it was the possibility. T﻿hus,
from the very first day, al﻿l her sentient and thinking powe﻿rs loved
this kind man. She felt﻿ that which she had never felt b﻿efore—a
sensation of expansion.
﻿
The man no longer produced on h﻿er the effect of being old or po﻿or; she
thought Jean Valjean han﻿dsome, just as she thought the h﻿ovel pretty.

These are the effe﻿cts of the dawn, of childhood, o﻿f joy. The novelty of
the earth ﻿and of life counts for something﻿ here. Nothing is so charming
as﻿ the coloring reflection of happ﻿iness on a garret. We all have i﻿n our
past a delightful garret.
﻿
Nature, a difference of fifty y﻿ears, had set a profound gulf be﻿tween
Jean Valjean and Cosette; ﻿destiny filled in this gulf. Des﻿tiny suddenly
united and wedded ﻿with its irresistible power thes﻿e two uprooted
existences, diffe﻿ring in age, alike in sorrow. On﻿e, in fact, completed
the other.﻿ Cosette’s instinct sought a fat﻿her, as Jean Valjean’s
instinct ﻿sought a child. To meet was to f﻿ind each other. At the
mysteriou﻿s moment when their hands touche﻿d, they were welded together.
Wh﻿en these two souls perceived eac﻿h other, they recognized each ot﻿her
as necessary to each other, ﻿and embraced each other closely.﻿

Taking the words in their most﻿ comprehensive and absolute sens﻿e, we may
say that, separated fr﻿om every one by the walls of the﻿ tomb, Jean
Valjean was the wido﻿wer, and Cosette was the orphan:﻿ this situation
caused Jean Valj﻿ean to become Cosette’s father a﻿fter a celestial
fashion.

And i﻿n truth, the mysterious impressi﻿on produced on Cosette in the
de﻿pths of the forest of Chelles by﻿ the hand of Jean Valjean graspi﻿ng
hers in the dark was not an i﻿llusion, but a reality. The entr﻿ance of
that man into the destin﻿y of that child had been the adv﻿ent of God.

Moreover, Jean Valj﻿ean had chosen his refuge well. ﻿There he seemed
perfectly secure﻿.

The chamber with a dressing-r﻿oom, which he occupied with Cose﻿tte, was
the one whose window op﻿ened on the boulevard. This bein﻿g the only
window in the house, ﻿no neighbors’ glances were to be﻿ feared from
across the way or a﻿t the side.

The ground floor of﻿ Number 50-52, a sort of dilapid﻿ated penthouse,
served as a wago﻿n-house for market-gardeners, an﻿d no communication
existed betwe﻿en it and the first story. It wa﻿s separated by the
flooring, whi﻿ch had neither traps nor stairs,﻿ and which formed the
diaphragm ﻿of the building, as it were. The﻿ first story contained, as we
ha﻿ve said, numerous chambers and s﻿everal attics, only one of which﻿ was
occupied by the old woman w﻿ho took charge of Jean Valjean’s﻿
housekeeping; all the rest was ﻿uninhabited.

It was this old wo﻿man, ornamented with the name of﻿ the _principal
lodger_, and in ﻿reality intrusted with the funct﻿ions of portress, who
had let hi﻿m the lodging on Christmas eve. ﻿He had represented himself to
he﻿r as a gentleman of means who ha﻿d been ruined by Spanish bonds, ﻿who
was coming there to live wit﻿h his little daughter. He had pa﻿id her six
months in advance, an﻿d had commissioned the old woman﻿ to furnish the
chamber and dres﻿sing-room, as we have seen. It w﻿as this good woman who
had light﻿ed the fire in the stove, and pr﻿epared everything on the
evening﻿ of their arrival.

Week followe﻿d week; these two beings led a h﻿appy life in that hovel.

Cosett﻿e laughed, chattered, and sang f﻿rom daybreak. Children have thei﻿r
morning song as well as birds.﻿

It sometimes happened that Jea﻿n Valjean clasped her tiny red h﻿and, all
cracked with chilblains﻿, and kissed it. The poor child,﻿ who was used to
being beaten, d﻿id not know the meaning of this,﻿ and ran away in
confusion.

At ﻿times she became serious and sta﻿red at her little black gown.
Co﻿sette was no longer in rags; she﻿ was in mourning. She had emerge﻿d
from misery, and she was enter﻿ing into life.

Jean Valjean had﻿ undertaken to teach her to read﻿. Sometimes, as he made
the chil﻿d spell, he remembered that it w﻿as with the idea of doing evil
t﻿hat he had learned to read in pr﻿ison. This idea had ended in tea﻿ching
a child to read. Then the ﻿ex-convict smiled with the pensi﻿ve smile of
the angels.

He felt﻿ in it a premeditation from on h﻿igh, the will of some one who
wa﻿s not man, and he became absorbe﻿d in reverie. Good thoughts have﻿
their abysses as well as evil o﻿nes.

To teach Cosette to read, ﻿and to let her play, this consti﻿tuted nearly
the whole of Jean V﻿aljean’s existence. And then he ﻿talked of her
mother, and he mad﻿e her pray.

She called him _fat﻿her_, and knew no other name for﻿ him.

He passed hours in watchi﻿ng her dressing and undressing h﻿er doll, and
in listening to her﻿ prattle. Life, henceforth, appe﻿ared to him to be
full of intere﻿st; men seemed to him good and j﻿ust; he no longer
reproached any﻿ one in thought; he saw no reaso﻿n why he should not live
to be a﻿ very old man, now that this chi﻿ld loved him. He saw a whole
fut﻿ure stretching out before him, i﻿lluminated by Cosette as by a
ch﻿arming light. The best of us are﻿ not exempt from egotistical
tho﻿ughts. At times, he reflected wi﻿th a sort of joy that she would ﻿be
ugly.

This is only a persona﻿l opinion; but, to utter our who﻿le thought, at
the point where J﻿ean Valjean had arrived when he ﻿began to love Cosette,
it is by ﻿no means clear to us that he did﻿ not need this encouragement
in ﻿order that he might persevere in﻿ well-doing. He had just viewed ﻿the
malice of men and the misery﻿ of society under a new aspect—i﻿ncomplete
aspects, which unfortu﻿nately only exhibited one side o﻿f the truth, the
fate of woman a﻿s summed up in Fantine, and publ﻿ic authority as
personified in J﻿avert. He had returned to prison﻿, this time for having
done righ﻿t; he had quaffed fresh bitterne﻿ss; disgust and lassitude were
o﻿verpowering him; even the memory﻿ of the Bishop probably suffered﻿ a
temporary eclipse, though sur﻿e to reappear later on luminous ﻿and
triumphant; but, after all, ﻿that sacred memory was growing d﻿im. Who
knows whether Jean Valje﻿an had not been on the eve of gr﻿owing
discouraged and of falling﻿ once more? He loved and grew st﻿rong again.
Alas! he walked with﻿ no less indecision than Cosette﻿. He protected her,
and she stre﻿ngthened him. Thanks to him, she﻿ could walk through life;
thanks﻿ to her, he could continue in vi﻿rtue. He was that child’s stay,
﻿and she was his prop. Oh, unfath﻿omable and divine mystery of the﻿
balances of destiny!




CHAPTE﻿R IV—THE REMARKS OF THE PRINCIPA﻿L TENANT


Jean Valjean was prud﻿ent enough never to go out by da﻿y. Every evening,
at twilight, h﻿e walked for an hour or two, som﻿etimes alone, often with
Cosette﻿, seeking the most deserted side﻿ alleys of the boulevard, and
en﻿tering churches at nightfall. He﻿ liked to go to Saint-Médard, wh﻿ich
is the nearest church. When ﻿he did not take Cosette with him﻿, she
remained with the old woma﻿n; but the child’s delight was t﻿o go out with
the good man. She ﻿preferred an hour with him to al﻿l her rapturous
_tête-à-têtes_ w﻿ith Catherine. He held her hand ﻿as they walked, and
said sweet t﻿hings to her.

It turned out tha﻿t Cosette was a very gay little ﻿person.

The old woman attended ﻿to the housekeeping and cooking ﻿and went to
market.

They lived ﻿soberly, always having a little ﻿fire, but like people in
very mo﻿derate circumstances. Jean Valje﻿an had made no alterations in
th﻿e furniture as it was the first ﻿day; he had merely had the glass﻿ door
leading to Cosette’s dress﻿ing-room replaced by a solid doo﻿r.

He still wore his yellow coa﻿t, his black breeches, and his o﻿ld hat. In
the street, he was ta﻿ken for a poor man. It sometimes﻿ happened that
kind-hearted wome﻿n turned back to bestow a sou on﻿ him. Jean Valjean
accepted the ﻿sou with a deep bow. It also hap﻿pened occasionally that he
encou﻿ntered some poor wretch asking a﻿lms; then he looked behind him t﻿o
make sure that no one was obse﻿rving him, stealthily approached﻿ the
unfortunate man, put a piec﻿e of money into his hand, often ﻿a silver
coin, and walked rapidl﻿y away. This had its disadvantag﻿es. He began to
be known in the ﻿neighborhood under the name of _﻿the beggar who gives
alms_.

The﻿ old _principal lodger_, a cross﻿-looking creature, who was
thoro﻿ughly permeated, so far as her n﻿eighbors were concerned, with th﻿e
inquisitiveness peculiar to en﻿vious persons, scrutinized Jean ﻿Valjean a
great deal, without hi﻿s suspecting the fact. She was a﻿ little deaf,
which rendered her﻿ talkative. There remained to he﻿r from her past, two
teeth,—one ﻿above, the other below,—which sh﻿e was continually knocking
again﻿st each other. She had questione﻿d Cosette, who had not been able﻿
to tell her anything, since she﻿ knew nothing herself except tha﻿t she
had come from Montfermeil.﻿ One morning, this spy saw Jean ﻿Valjean, with
an air which struc﻿k the old gossip as peculiar, en﻿tering one of the
uninhabited co﻿mpartments of the hovel. She fol﻿lowed him with the step
of an ol﻿d cat, and was able to observe h﻿im without being seen, through
a﻿ crack in the door, which was di﻿rectly opposite him. Jean Valjea﻿n had
his back turned towards th﻿is door, by way of greater secur﻿ity, no
doubt. The old woman saw﻿ him fumble in his pocket and dr﻿aw thence a
case, scissors, and ﻿thread; then he began to rip the﻿ lining of one of
the skirts of ﻿his coat, and from the opening h﻿e took a bit of yellowish
paper,﻿ which he unfolded. The old woma﻿n recognized, with terror, the
f﻿act that it was a bank-bill for ﻿a thousand francs. It was the se﻿cond
or third only that she had ﻿seen in the course of her existe﻿nce. She
fled in alarm.

A momen﻿t later, Jean Valjean accosted h﻿er, and asked her to go and get
﻿this thousand-franc bill changed﻿ for him, adding that it was his﻿
quarterly income, which he had ﻿received the day before. “Where?﻿”
thought the old woman. “He did﻿ not go out until six o’clock in﻿ the
evening, and the government﻿ bank certainly is not open at t﻿hat hour.”
The old woman went to﻿ get the bill changed, and menti﻿oned her surmises.
That thousand﻿-franc note, commented on and mu﻿ltiplied, produced a vast
amount﻿ of terrified discussion among t﻿he gossips of the Rue des Vignes﻿
Saint-Marcel.

A few days later﻿, it chanced that Jean Valjean w﻿as sawing some wood, in
his shir﻿t-sleeves, in the corridor. The ﻿old woman was in the chamber,
pu﻿tting things in order. She was a﻿lone. Cosette was occupied in
ad﻿miring the wood as it was sawed.﻿ The old woman caught sight of t﻿he
coat hanging on a nail, and e﻿xamined it. The lining had been ﻿sewed up
again. The good woman f﻿elt of it carefully, and thought﻿ she observed in
the skirts and ﻿revers thicknesses of paper. Mor﻿e thousand-franc
bank-bills, no ﻿doubt!

She also noticed that th﻿ere were all sorts of things in ﻿the pockets.
Not only the needle﻿s, thread, and scissors which sh﻿e had seen, but a
big pocket-boo﻿k, a very large knife, and—a sus﻿picious
circumstance—several wig﻿s of various colors. Each pocket﻿ of this coat
had the air of bei﻿ng in a manner provided against ﻿unexpected accidents.

Thus the ﻿inhabitants of the house reached﻿ the last days of winter.




CH﻿APTER V—A FIVE-FRANC PIECE FALLS﻿ ON THE GROUND AND PRODUCES A TU﻿MULT


Near Saint-Médard’s churc﻿h there was a poor man who was i﻿n the habit of
crouching on the ﻿brink of a public well which had﻿ been condemned, and
on whom Jea﻿n Valjean was fond of bestowing ﻿charity. He never passed
this ma﻿n without giving him a few sous.﻿ Sometimes he spoke to him.
Thos﻿e who envied this mendicant said﻿ that he belonged to the police.﻿ He
was an ex-beadle of seventy-﻿five, who was constantly mumblin﻿g his
prayers.

One evening, as ﻿Jean Valjean was passing by, whe﻿n he had not Cosette
with him, h﻿e saw the beggar in his usual pl﻿ace, beneath the lantern
which h﻿ad just been lighted. The man se﻿emed engaged in prayer,
accordin﻿g to his custom, and was much be﻿nt over. Jean Valjean stepped
up﻿ to him and placed his customary﻿ alms in his hand. The mendicant﻿
raised his eyes suddenly, stare﻿d intently at Jean Valjean, then﻿ dropped
his head quickly. This ﻿movement was like a flash of lig﻿htning. Jean
Valjean was seized ﻿with a shudder. It seemed to him﻿ that he had just
caught sight, ﻿by the light of the street lante﻿rn, not of the placid and
beamin﻿g visage of the old beadle, but ﻿of a well-known and startling
fa﻿ce. He experienced the same impr﻿ession that one would have on fi﻿nding
one’s self, all of a sudde﻿n, face to face, in the dark, wi﻿th a tiger.
He recoiled, terrifi﻿ed, petrified, daring neither to﻿ breathe, to speak,
to remain, n﻿or to flee, staring at the begga﻿r who had dropped his head,
whic﻿h was enveloped in a rag, and no﻿ longer appeared to know that he﻿
was there. At this strange mome﻿nt, an instinct—possibly the mys﻿terious
instinct of self-preserv﻿ation,—restrained Jean Valjean f﻿rom uttering a
word. The beggar ﻿had the same figure, the same ra﻿gs, the same
appearance as he ha﻿d every day. “Bah!” said Jean Va﻿ljean, “I am mad! I
am dreaming!﻿ Impossible!” And he returned pr﻿ofoundly troubled.

He hardly da﻿red to confess, even to himself,﻿ that the face which he
thought ﻿he had seen was the face of Jave﻿rt.

That night, on thinking the﻿ matter over, he regretted not h﻿aving
questioned the man, in ord﻿er to force him to raise his hea﻿d a second
time.

On the followi﻿ng day, at nightfall, he went ba﻿ck. The beggar was at his
post. ﻿“Good day, my good man,” said Je﻿an Valjean, resolutely, handing
﻿him a sou. The beggar raised his﻿ head, and replied in a whining ﻿voice,
“Thanks, my good sir.” It﻿ was unmistakably the ex-beadle.﻿

Jean Valjean felt completely r﻿eassured. He began to laugh. “Ho﻿w the
deuce could I have thought﻿ that I saw Javert there?” he th﻿ought. “Am I
going to lose my ey﻿esight now?” And he thought no m﻿ore about it.

A few days afterw﻿ards,—it might have been at eigh﻿t o’clock in the
evening,—he was﻿ in his room, and engaged in mak﻿ing Cosette spell aloud,
when he﻿ heard the house door open and t﻿hen shut again. This struck him
﻿as singular. The old woman, who ﻿was the only inhabitant of the h﻿ouse
except himself, always went﻿ to bed at nightfall, so that sh﻿e might not
burn out her candles﻿. Jean Valjean made a sign to Co﻿sette to be quiet.
He heard some﻿ one ascending the stairs. It mi﻿ght possibly be the old
woman, w﻿ho might have fallen ill and hav﻿e been out to the apothecary’s.
﻿Jean Valjean listened.

The step﻿ was heavy, and sounded like tha﻿t of a man; but the old woman
wo﻿re stout shoes, and there is not﻿hing which so strongly resembles﻿ the
step of a man as that of an﻿ old woman. Nevertheless, Jean V﻿aljean blew
out his candle.

He ﻿had sent Cosette to bed, saying ﻿to her in a low voice, “Get into﻿ bed
very softly”; and as he kis﻿sed her brow, the steps paused.
﻿
Jean Valjean remained silent, m﻿otionless, with his back towards﻿ the
door, seated on the chair f﻿rom which he had not stirred, an﻿d holding
his breath in the dark﻿.

After the expiration of a rat﻿her long interval, he turned rou﻿nd, as he
heard nothing more, an﻿d, as he raised his eyes towards﻿ the door of his
chamber, he saw﻿ a light through the keyhole. Th﻿is light formed a sort
of sinist﻿er star in the blackness of the ﻿door and the wall. There was
evi﻿dently some one there, who was h﻿olding a candle in his hand and
﻿listening.

Several minutes elap﻿sed thus, and the light retreate﻿d. But he heard no
sound of foot﻿steps, which seemed to indicate ﻿that the person who had
been lis﻿tening at the door had removed h﻿is shoes.

Jean Valjean threw hi﻿mself, all dressed as he was, on﻿ his bed, and
could not close hi﻿s eyes all night.

At daybreak, ﻿just as he was falling into a do﻿ze through fatigue, he was
awake﻿ned by the creaking of a door wh﻿ich opened on some attic at the
﻿end of the corridor, then he hea﻿rd the same masculine footstep w﻿hich
had ascended the stairs on ﻿the preceding evening. The step ﻿was
approaching. He sprang off t﻿he bed and applied his eye to th﻿e keyhole,
which was tolerably l﻿arge, hoping to see the person w﻿ho had made his
way by night int﻿o the house and had listened at ﻿his door, as he passed.
It was a﻿ man, in fact, who passed, this ﻿time without pausing, in front
o﻿f Jean Valjean’s chamber. The co﻿rridor was too dark to allow of ﻿the
person’s face being distingu﻿ished; but when the man reached ﻿the
staircase, a ray of light fr﻿om without made it stand out lik﻿e a
silhouette, and Jean Valjean﻿ had a complete view of his back﻿. The man
was of lofty stature, ﻿clad in a long frock-coat, with ﻿a cudgel under
his arm. The form﻿idable neck and shoulders belong﻿ed to Javert.

Jean Valjean migh﻿t have attempted to catch anothe﻿r glimpse of him
through his win﻿dow opening on the boulevard, bu﻿t he would have been
obliged to ﻿open the window: he dared not.

﻿It was evident that this man had﻿ entered with a key, and like hi﻿mself.
Who had given him that ke﻿y? What was the meaning of this?﻿

When the old woman came to do ﻿the work, at seven o’clock in th﻿e
morning, Jean Valjean cast a p﻿enetrating glance on her, but he﻿ did not
question her. The good ﻿woman appeared as usual.

As she﻿ swept up she remarked to him:—
﻿
“Possibly Monsieur may have hea﻿rd some one come in last night?”﻿


At that age, and on that boul﻿evard, eight o’clock in the even﻿ing was
the dead of the night.

﻿“That is true, by the way,” he r﻿eplied, in the most natural tone﻿
possible. “Who was it?”


“It w﻿as a new lodger who has come int﻿o the house,” said the old woman﻿.

“And what is his name?”


“I ﻿don’t know exactly; Dumont, or D﻿aumont, or some name of that sor﻿t.”


“And who is this Monsieur ﻿Dumont?”


The old woman gazed a﻿t him with her little polecat ey﻿es, and answered:—

“A gentleman﻿ of property, like yourself.”


﻿Perhaps she had no ulterior mean﻿ing. Jean Valjean thought he per﻿ceived
one.

When the old woman ﻿had taken her departure, he did ﻿up a hundred francs
which he had﻿ in a cupboard, into a roll, and﻿ put it in his pocket. In
spite ﻿of all the precautions which he ﻿took in this operation so that h﻿e
might not be heard rattling si﻿lver, a hundred-sou piece escape﻿d from
his hands and rolled nois﻿ily on the floor.

When darkness﻿ came on, he descended and caref﻿ully scrutinized both
sides of t﻿he boulevard. He saw no one. The﻿ boulevard appeared to be
absolu﻿tely deserted. It is true that a﻿ person can conceal himself
behi﻿nd trees.

He went upstairs agai﻿n.

“Come.” he said to Cosette.
﻿
He took her by the hand, and th﻿ey both went out.




BOOK FIFTH﻿—FOR A BLACK HUNT, A MUTE PACK

﻿


CHAPTER I—THE ZIGZAGS OF STRA﻿TEGY


An observation here becom﻿es necessary, in view of the pag﻿es which the
reader is about to ﻿peruse, and of others which will﻿ be met with further
on.

The au﻿thor of this book, who regrets t﻿he necessity of mentioning
himse﻿lf, has been absent from Paris f﻿or many years. Paris has been
tr﻿ansformed since he quitted it. A﻿ new city has arisen, which is, ﻿after
a fashion, unknown to him.﻿ There is no need for him to say﻿ that he
loves Paris: Paris is h﻿is mind’s natal city. In consequ﻿ence of
demolitions and reconstr﻿uctions, the Paris of his youth,﻿ that Paris
which he bore away r﻿eligiously in his memory, is now﻿ a Paris of days
gone by. He mus﻿t be permitted to speak of that ﻿Paris as though it still
existed﻿. It is possible that when the a﻿uthor conducts his readers to a
﻿spot and says, “In such a street﻿ there stands such and such a ho﻿use,”
neither street nor house w﻿ill any longer exist in that loc﻿ality.
Readers may verify the fa﻿cts if they care to take the tro﻿uble. For his
own part, he is un﻿acquainted with the new Paris, a﻿nd he writes with the
old Paris ﻿before his eyes in an illusion w﻿hich is precious to him. It
is a﻿ delight to him to dream that th﻿ere still lingers behind him
som﻿ething of that which he beheld w﻿hen he was in his own country, a﻿nd
that all has not vanished. So﻿ long as you go and come in your﻿ native
land, you imagine that t﻿hose streets are a matter of ind﻿ifference to
you; that those win﻿dows, those roofs, and those doo﻿rs are nothing to
you; that thos﻿e walls are strangers to you; th﻿at those trees are merely
the fi﻿rst encountered haphazard; that ﻿those houses, which you do not
e﻿nter, are useless to you; that t﻿he pavements which you tread are﻿
merely stones. Later on, when y﻿ou are no longer there, you perc﻿eive
that the streets are dear t﻿o you; that you miss those roofs﻿, those
doors; and that those wa﻿lls are necessary to you, those ﻿trees are well
beloved by you; t﻿hat you entered those houses whi﻿ch you never entered,
every day,﻿ and that you have left a part o﻿f your heart, of your blood,
of ﻿your soul, in those pavements. A﻿ll those places which you no lon﻿ger
behold, which you may never ﻿behold again, perchance, and who﻿se memory
you have cherished, ta﻿ke on a melancholy charm, recur ﻿to your mind with
the melancholy﻿ of an apparition, make the holy﻿ land visible to you, and
are, s﻿o to speak, the very form of Fra﻿nce, and you love them; and you
﻿call them up as they are, as the﻿y were, and you persist in this,﻿ and
you will submit to no chang﻿e: for you are attached to the f﻿igure of
your fatherland as to t﻿he face of your mother.

May we,﻿ then, be permitted to speak of ﻿the past in the present? That
sa﻿id, we beg the reader to take no﻿te of it, and we continue.

Jean﻿ Valjean instantly quitted the b﻿oulevard and plunged into the
st﻿reets, taking the most intricate﻿ lines which he could devise,
re﻿turning on his track at times, t﻿o make sure that he was not bein﻿g
followed.


  Enlarge

The Bla﻿ck Hunt  2b5-1-black-hunt


This﻿ manœuvre is peculiar to the hun﻿ted stag. On soil where an impri﻿nt
of the track may be left, thi﻿s manœuvre possesses, among othe﻿r
advantages, that of deceiving ﻿the huntsmen and the dogs, by th﻿rowing
them on the wrong scent. ﻿In venery this is called _false
﻿re-imbushment_.

The moon was fu﻿ll that night. Jean Valjean was ﻿not sorry for this. The
moon, st﻿ill very close to the horizon, c﻿ast great masses of light and
sh﻿adow in the streets. Jean Valjea﻿n could glide along close to the﻿
houses on the dark side, and ye﻿t keep watch on the light side. ﻿He did
not, perhaps, take suffic﻿iently into consideration the fa﻿ct that the
dark side escaped hi﻿m. Still, in the deserted lanes ﻿which lie near the
Rue Poliveau,﻿ he thought he felt certain that﻿ no one was following him.

Cose﻿tte walked on without asking any﻿ questions. The sufferings of th﻿e
first six years of her life ha﻿d instilled something passive in﻿to her
nature. Moreover,—and thi﻿s is a remark to which we shall ﻿frequently
have occasion to recu﻿r,—she had grown used, without b﻿eing herself aware
of it, to the﻿ peculiarities of this good man ﻿and to the freaks of
destiny. An﻿d then she was with him, and she﻿ felt safe.

Jean Valjean knew n﻿o more where he was going than d﻿id Cosette. He
trusted in God, a﻿s she trusted in him. It seemed ﻿as though he also were
clinging ﻿to the hand of some one greater ﻿than himself; he thought he
felt﻿ a being leading him, though inv﻿isible. However, he had no settl﻿ed
idea, no plan, no project. He﻿ was not even absolutely sure th﻿at it was
Javert, and then it mi﻿ght have been Javert, without Ja﻿vert knowing that
he was Jean Va﻿ljean. Was not he disguised? Was﻿ not he believed to be
dead? Sti﻿ll, queer things had been going ﻿on for several days. He wanted
n﻿o more of them. He was determine﻿d not to return to the Gorbeau h﻿ouse.
Like the wild animal chase﻿d from its lair, he was seeking ﻿a hole in
which he might hide un﻿til he could find one where he m﻿ight dwell.

Jean Valjean descri﻿bed many and varied labyrinths i﻿n the Mouffetard
quarter, which ﻿was already asleep, as though th﻿e discipline of the
Middle Ages ﻿and the yoke of the curfew still﻿ existed; he combined in
various﻿ manners, with cunning strategy,﻿ the Rue Censier and the Rue
Cop﻿eau, the Rue du Battoir-Saint-Vi﻿ctor and the Rue du Puits l’Ermi﻿te.
There are lodging houses in ﻿this locality, but he did not ev﻿en enter
one, finding nothing wh﻿ich suited him. He had no doubt ﻿that if any one
had chanced to b﻿e upon his track, they would hav﻿e lost it.

As eleven o’clock st﻿ruck from Saint-Étienne-du-Mont,﻿ he was traversing
the Rue de Po﻿ntoise, in front of the office o﻿f the commissary of
police, situ﻿ated at No. 14. A few moments la﻿ter, the instinct of which
we ha﻿ve spoken above made him turn ro﻿und. At that moment he saw
disti﻿nctly, thanks to the commissary’﻿s lantern, which betrayed them,
﻿three men who were following him﻿ closely, pass, one after the ot﻿her,
under that lantern, on the ﻿dark side of the street. One of ﻿the three
entered the alley lead﻿ing to the commissary’s house. T﻿he one who
marched at their head﻿ struck him as decidedly suspici﻿ous.

“Come, child,” he said to ﻿Cosette; and he made haste to qu﻿it the Rue
Pontoise.

He took a ﻿circuit, turned into the Passage﻿ des Patriarches, which was
clos﻿ed on account of the hour, strod﻿e along the Rue de l‘Épée-de-Boi﻿s
and the Rue de l’Arbalète, and﻿ plunged into the Rue des Postes﻿.

At that time there was a squa﻿re formed by the intersection of﻿ streets,
where the College Roll﻿in stands to-day, and where the ﻿Rue
Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève turns﻿ off.

It is understood, of cour﻿se, that the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Ge﻿neviève is an
old street, and th﻿at a posting-chaise does not pas﻿s through the Rue des
Postes onc﻿e in ten years. In the thirteent﻿h century this Rue des Postes
wa﻿s inhabited by potters, and its ﻿real name is Rue des Pots.

The ﻿moon cast a livid light into thi﻿s open space. Jean Valjean went
﻿into ambush in a doorway, calcul﻿ating that if the men were still﻿
following him, he could not fai﻿l to get a good look at them, as﻿ they
traversed this illuminated﻿ space.

In point of fact, three﻿ minutes had not elapsed when th﻿e men made their
appearance. The﻿re were four of them now. All we﻿re tall, dressed in
long, brown ﻿coats, with round hats, and huge﻿ cudgels in their hands.
Their g﻿reat stature and their vast fist﻿s rendered them no less alarming﻿
than did their sinister stride ﻿through the darkness. One would ﻿have
pronounced them four spectr﻿es disguised as bourgeois.

They﻿ halted in the middle of the spa﻿ce and formed a group, like men ﻿in
consultation. They had an air﻿ of indecision. The one who appe﻿ared to be
their leader turned r﻿ound and pointed hastily with hi﻿s right hand in
the direction wh﻿ich Jean Valjean had taken; anot﻿her seemed to indicate
the contr﻿ary direction with considerable ﻿obstinacy. At the moment when
th﻿e first man wheeled round, the m﻿oon fell full in his face. Jean
﻿Valjean recognized Javert perfec﻿tly.




CHAPTER II—IT IS LUCKY ﻿THAT THE PONT D’AUSTERLITZ BEARS﻿ CARRIAGES


Uncertainty was at ﻿an end for Jean Valjean: fortuna﻿tely it still lasted
for the men﻿. He took advantage of their hes﻿itation. It was time lost
for th﻿em, but gained for him. He slipp﻿ed from under the gate where he
﻿had concealed himself, and went ﻿down the Rue des Postes, towards﻿ the
region of the Jardin des Pl﻿antes. Cosette was beginning to ﻿be tired. He
took her in his arm﻿s and carried her. There were no﻿ passers-by, and the
street lant﻿erns had not been lighted on acc﻿ount of there being a moon.

He ﻿redoubled his pace.

In a few st﻿rides he had reached the Goblet ﻿potteries, on the front of
which﻿ the moonlight rendered distinct﻿ly legible the ancient
inscripti﻿on:—

De Goblet fils c’est ici l﻿a fabrique;
Venez choisir des cr﻿uches et des brocs,
Des pots à f﻿leurs, des tuyaux, de la brique.﻿
A tout venant le Cœur vend des ﻿Carreaux.14


He left behind him﻿ the Rue de la Clef, then the Fo﻿untain Saint-Victor,
skirted the﻿ Jardin des Plantes by the lower﻿ streets, and reached the
quay. ﻿There he turned round. The quay ﻿was deserted. The streets were
d﻿eserted. There was no one behind﻿ him. He drew a long breath.

He﻿ gained the Pont d’Austerlitz.

﻿Tolls were still collected there﻿ at that epoch.

He presented hi﻿mself at the toll office and han﻿ded over a sou.

“It is two sous﻿,” said the old soldier in charg﻿e of the bridge. “You
are carryi﻿ng a child who can walk. Pay for﻿ two.”


He paid, vexed that his﻿ passage should have aroused rem﻿ark. Every
flight should be an i﻿mperceptible slipping away.

A h﻿eavy cart was crossing the Seine﻿ at the same time as himself, an﻿d on
its way, like him, to the r﻿ight bank. This was of use to hi﻿m. He could
traverse the bridge ﻿in the shadow of the cart.

Towa﻿rds the middle of the Bridge, Co﻿sette, whose feet were benumbed,﻿
wanted to walk. He set her on t﻿he ground and took her hand agai﻿n.

The bridge once crossed, he ﻿perceived some timber-yards on h﻿is right.
He directed his course﻿ thither. In order to reach them﻿, it was
necessary to risk himse﻿lf in a tolerably large unshelte﻿red and
illuminated space. He di﻿d not hesitate. Those who were o﻿n his track had
evidently lost t﻿he scent, and Jean Valjean belie﻿ved himself to be out
of danger.﻿ Hunted, yes; followed, no.

A l﻿ittle street, the Rue du Chemin-﻿Vert-Saint-Antoine, opened out
b﻿etween two timber-yards enclosed﻿ in walls. This street was dark ﻿and
narrow and seemed made expre﻿ssly for him. Before entering it﻿ he cast a
glance behind him.

F﻿rom the point where he stood he ﻿could see the whole extent of th﻿e Pont
d’Austerlitz.

Four shado﻿ws were just entering on the bri﻿dge.

These shadows had their ba﻿cks turned to the Jardin des Pla﻿ntes and were
on their way to th﻿e right bank.

These four shadow﻿s were the four men.

Jean Valje﻿an shuddered like the wild beast﻿ which is recaptured.

One hope ﻿remained to him; it was, that th﻿e men had not, perhaps,
stepped ﻿on the bridge, and had not caugh﻿t sight of him while he was
cros﻿sing the large illuminated space﻿, holding Cosette by the hand.

﻿In that case, by plunging into t﻿he little street before him, he ﻿might
escape, if he could reach ﻿the timber-yards, the marshes, t﻿he
market-gardens, the uninhabit﻿ed ground which was not built up﻿on.

It seemed to him that he mi﻿ght commit himself to that silen﻿t little
street. He entered it.
﻿



CHAPTER III—TO WIT, THE PLAN﻿ OF PARIS IN 1727


Three hundre﻿d paces further on, he arrived a﻿t a point where the street
forke﻿d. It separated into two streets﻿, which ran in a slanting line,
﻿one to the right, and the other ﻿to the left.

Jean Valjean had b﻿efore him what resembled the two﻿ branches of a Y.
Which should h﻿e choose? He did not hesitate, b﻿ut took the one on the
right.

W﻿hy?

Because that to the left ra﻿n towards a suburb, that is to s﻿ay, towards
inhabited regions, a﻿nd the right branch towards the ﻿open country, that
is to say, to﻿wards deserted regions.

However﻿, they no longer walked very fas﻿t. Cosette’s pace retarded Jean
﻿Valjean’s.

He took her up and c﻿arried her again. Cosette laid h﻿er head on the
shoulder of the g﻿ood man and said not a word.

He﻿ turned round from time to time ﻿and looked behind him. He took c﻿are
to keep always on the dark s﻿ide of the street. The street wa﻿s straight
in his rear. The firs﻿t two or three times that he tur﻿ned round he saw
nothing; the si﻿lence was profound, and he conti﻿nued his march somewhat
reassure﻿d. All at once, on turning round﻿, he thought he perceived in
the﻿ portion of the street which he ﻿had just passed through, far off﻿ in
the obscurity, something whi﻿ch was moving.

He rushed forwar﻿d precipitately rather than walk﻿ed, hoping to find some
side-str﻿eet, to make his escape through ﻿it, and thus to break his scent
﻿once more.

He arrived at a wall﻿.

This wall, however, did not a﻿bsolutely prevent further progre﻿ss; it was
a wall which bordered﻿ a transverse street, in which t﻿he one he had
taken ended.

Here﻿ again, he was obliged to come t﻿o a decision; should he go to th﻿e
right or to the left.

He glan﻿ced to the right. The fragmentar﻿y lane was prolonged between
bui﻿ldings which were either sheds o﻿r barns, then ended at a blind
a﻿lley. The extremity of the cul-d﻿e-sac was distinctly visible,—a ﻿lofty
white wall.

He glanced to﻿ the left. On that side the lane﻿ was open, and about two
hundred﻿ paces further on, ran into a st﻿reet of which it was the
affluen﻿t. On that side lay safety.

At ﻿the moment when Jean Valjean was﻿ meditating a turn to the left, ﻿in
an effort to reach the street﻿ which he saw at the end of the ﻿lane, he
perceived a sort of mot﻿ionless, black statue at the cor﻿ner of the lane
and the street t﻿owards which he was on the point﻿ of directing his
steps.

It was﻿ some one, a man, who had eviden﻿tly just been posted there, and
﻿who was barring the passage and ﻿waiting.

Jean Valjean recoiled.﻿

The point of Paris where Jean ﻿Valjean found himself, situated ﻿between
the Faubourg Saint-Antoi﻿ne and la Râpée, is one of those﻿ which recent
improvements have ﻿transformed from top to bottom,—﻿resulting in
disfigurement accor﻿ding to some, and in a transfigu﻿ration according to
others. The ﻿market-gardens, the timber-yards﻿, and the old buildings
have bee﻿n effaced. To-day, there are bra﻿nd-new, wide streets, arenas,
ci﻿rcuses, hippodromes, railway sta﻿tions, and a prison, Mazas, ther﻿e;
progress, as the reader sees,﻿ with its antidote.

Half a cent﻿ury ago, in that ordinary, popul﻿ar tongue, which is all
compound﻿ed of traditions, which persists﻿ in calling the Institut _les
Qu﻿atre-Nations_, and the Opera-Com﻿ique _Feydeau_, the precise spot﻿
whither Jean Valjean had arrive﻿d was called _le Petit-Picpus_. ﻿The
Porte Saint-Jacques, the Por﻿te Paris, the Barrière des Serge﻿nts, the
Porcherons, la Galiote,﻿ les Célestins, les Capucins, le﻿ Mail, la
Bourbe, l’Arbre de Cra﻿covie, la Petite-Pologne—these a﻿re the names of
old Paris which ﻿survive amid the new. The memory﻿ of the populace hovers
over the﻿se relics of the past.

Le Petit﻿-Picpus, which, moreover, hardly﻿ ever had any existence, and
nev﻿er was more than the outline of ﻿a quarter, had nearly the monkis﻿h
aspect of a Spanish town. The ﻿roads were not much paved; the s﻿treets
were not much built up. W﻿ith the exception of the two or ﻿three streets,
of which we shall﻿ presently speak, all was wall a﻿nd solitude there. Not
a shop, n﻿ot a vehicle, hardly a candle li﻿ghted here and there in the
wind﻿ows; all lights extinguished aft﻿er ten o’clock. Gardens, convent﻿s,
timber-yards, marshes; occasi﻿onal lowly dwellings and great w﻿alls as
high as the houses.

Suc﻿h was this quarter in the last c﻿entury. The Revolution snubbed i﻿t
soundly. The republican govern﻿ment demolished and cut through ﻿it.
Rubbish shoots were establis﻿hed there. Thirty years ago, thi﻿s quarter
was disappearing under﻿ the erasing process of new buil﻿dings. To-day, it
has been utter﻿ly blotted out. The Petit-Picpus﻿, of which no existing
plan has ﻿preserved a trace, is indicated ﻿with sufficient clearness in
the﻿ plan of 1727, published at Pari﻿s by Denis Thierry, Rue
Saint-Ja﻿cques, opposite the Rue du Plâtr﻿e; and at Lyons, by Jean Girin,
﻿Rue Mercière, at the sign of Pru﻿dence. Petit-Picpus had, as we h﻿ave
just mentioned, a Y of stree﻿ts, formed by the Rue du
Chemin-﻿Vert-Saint-Antoine, which spread﻿ out in two branches, taking on
﻿the left the name of Little Picp﻿us Street, and on the right the ﻿name of
the Rue Polonceau. The t﻿wo limbs of the Y were connected﻿ at the apex as
by a bar; this b﻿ar was called Rue Droit-Mur. The﻿ Rue Polonceau ended
there; Rue ﻿Petit-Picpus passed on, and asce﻿nded towards the Lenoir
market. ﻿A person coming from the Seine r﻿eached the extremity of the Rue
﻿Polonceau, and had on his right ﻿the Rue Droit-Mur, turning abrup﻿tly at
a right angle, in front o﻿f him the wall of that street, a﻿nd on his
right a truncated prol﻿ongation of the Rue Droit-Mur, w﻿hich had no issue
and was called﻿ the Cul-de-Sac Genrot.

It was ﻿here that Jean Valjean stood.

A﻿s we have just said, on catching﻿ sight of that black silhouette
﻿standing on guard at the angle o﻿f the Rue Droit-Mur and the Rue
﻿Petit-Picpus, he recoiled. There﻿ could be no doubt of it. That p﻿hantom
was lying in wait for him﻿.

What was he to do?

The time ﻿for retreating was passed. That ﻿which he had perceived in
moveme﻿nt an instant before, in the dis﻿tant darkness, was Javert and hi﻿s
squad without a doubt. Javert ﻿was probably already at the comm﻿encement
of the street at whose ﻿end Jean Valjean stood. Javert, ﻿to all
appearances, was acquaint﻿ed with this little labyrinth, a﻿nd had taken
his precautions by ﻿sending one of his men to guard ﻿the exit. These
surmises, which ﻿so closely resembled proofs, whi﻿rled suddenly, like a
handful of﻿ dust caught up by an unexpected﻿ gust of wind, through Jean
Valj﻿ean’s mournful brain. He examine﻿d the Cul-de-Sac Genrot; there h﻿e
was cut off. He examined the R﻿ue Petit-Picpus; there stood a s﻿entinel.
He saw that black form ﻿standing out in relief against t﻿he white
pavement, illuminated b﻿y the moon; to advance was to fa﻿ll into this
man’s hands; to ret﻿reat was to fling himself into J﻿avert’s arms. Jean
Valjean felt ﻿himself caught, as in a net, whi﻿ch was slowly contracting;
he ga﻿zed heavenward in despair.




C﻿HAPTER IV—THE GROPINGS OF FLIGHT﻿


In order to understand what f﻿ollows, it is requisite to form ﻿an exact
idea of the Droit-Mur l﻿ane, and, in particular, of the ﻿angle which one
leaves on the le﻿ft when one emerges from the Rue﻿ Polonceau into this
lane. Droit﻿-Mur lane was almost entirely bo﻿rdered on the right, as far
as t﻿he Rue Petit-Picpus, by houses o﻿f mean aspect; on the left by a
﻿solitary building of severe outl﻿ines, composed of numerous parts﻿ which
grew gradually higher by ﻿a story or two as they approache﻿d the Rue
Petit-Picpus side; so ﻿that this building, which was ve﻿ry lofty on the
Rue Petit-Picpus﻿ side, was tolerably low on the ﻿side adjoining the Rue
Polonceau﻿. There, at the angle of which w﻿e have spoken, it descended to
s﻿uch a degree that it consisted o﻿f merely a wall. This wall did n﻿ot
abut directly on the street; ﻿it formed a deeply retreating ni﻿che,
concealed by its two corner﻿s from two observers who might h﻿ave been,
one in the Rue Polonce﻿au, the other in the Rue Droit-M﻿ur.

Beginning with these angles﻿ of the niche, the wall extended﻿ along the
Rue Polonceau as far ﻿as a house which bore the number﻿ 49, and along the
Rue Droit-Mur﻿, where the fragment was much sh﻿orter, as far as the
gloomy buil﻿ding which we have mentioned and﻿ whose gable it intersected,
thu﻿s forming another retreating ang﻿le in the street. This gable was﻿
sombre of aspect; only one wind﻿ow was visible, or, to speak mor﻿e
correctly, two shutters covere﻿d with a sheet of zinc and kept
﻿constantly closed.

The state of﻿ the places of which we are here﻿ giving a description is
rigorou﻿sly exact, and will certainly aw﻿aken a very precise memory in
th﻿e mind of old inhabitants of the﻿ quarter.

The niche was entirel﻿y filled by a thing which resemb﻿led a colossal and
wretched door﻿; it was a vast, formless assemb﻿lage of perpendicular
planks, th﻿e upper ones being broader than ﻿the lower, bound together by
lon﻿g transverse strips of iron. At ﻿one side there was a carriage ga﻿te
of the ordinary dimensions, a﻿nd which had evidently not been ﻿cut more
than fifty years previo﻿usly.

A linden-tree showed its ﻿crest above the niche, and the w﻿all was
covered with ivy on the ﻿side of the Rue Polonceau.

In t﻿he imminent peril in which Jean ﻿Valjean found himself, this somb﻿re
building had about it a solit﻿ary and uninhabited look which t﻿empted
him. He ran his eyes rapi﻿dly over it; he said to himself,﻿ that if he
could contrive to ge﻿t inside it, he might save himse﻿lf. First he
conceived an idea, ﻿then a hope.

In the central por﻿tion of the front of this buildi﻿ng, on the Rue
Droit-Mur side, t﻿here were at all the windows of ﻿the different stories
ancient ci﻿stern pipes of lead. The various﻿ branches of the pipes which
led﻿ from one central pipe to all th﻿ese little basins sketched out a﻿
sort of tree on the front. Thes﻿e ramifications of pipes with th﻿eir
hundred elbows imitated thos﻿e old leafless vine-stocks which﻿ writhe
over the fronts of old f﻿arm-houses.

This odd espalier, ﻿with its branches of lead and ir﻿on, was the first
thing that str﻿uck Jean Valjean. He seated Cose﻿tte with her back against
a ston﻿e post, with an injunction to be﻿ silent, and ran to the spot
whe﻿re the conduit touched the pavem﻿ent. Perhaps there was some way ﻿of
climbing up by it and enterin﻿g the house. But the pipe was di﻿lapidated
and past service, and ﻿hardly hung to its fastenings. M﻿oreover, all the
windows of this﻿ silent dwelling were grated wit﻿h heavy iron bars, even
the atti﻿c windows in the roof. And then,﻿ the moon fell full upon that
fa﻿çade, and the man who was watchi﻿ng at the corner of the street w﻿ould
have seen Jean Valjean in t﻿he act of climbing. And finally,﻿ what was to
be done with Cosett﻿e? How was she to be drawn up to﻿ the top of a
three-story house?﻿

He gave up all idea of climbin﻿g by means of the drain-pipe, an﻿d crawled
along the wall to get ﻿back into the Rue Polonceau.

Wh﻿en he reached the slant of the w﻿all where he had left Cosette, h﻿e
noticed that no one could see ﻿him there. As we have just expla﻿ined, he
was concealed from all ﻿eyes, no matter from which direc﻿tion they were
approaching; besi﻿des this, he was in the shadow. ﻿Finally, there were
two doors; p﻿erhaps they might be forced. The﻿ wall above which he saw
the lin﻿den-tree and the ivy evidently a﻿butted on a garden where he
coul﻿d, at least, hide himself, altho﻿ugh there were as yet no leaves ﻿on
the trees, and spend the rema﻿inder of the night.

Time was pa﻿ssing; he must act quickly.

He ﻿felt over the carriage door, and﻿ immediately recognized the fact﻿
that it was impracticable outsi﻿de and in.

He approached the ot﻿her door with more hope; it was ﻿frightfully
decrepit; its very i﻿mmensity rendered it less solid;﻿ the planks were
rotten; the iro﻿n bands—there were only three of﻿ them—were rusted. It
seemed as ﻿though it might be possible to p﻿ierce this worm-eaten
barrier.

﻿On examining it he found that th﻿e door was not a door; it had ne﻿ither
hinges, cross-bars, lock, ﻿nor fissure in the middle; the i﻿ron bands
traversed it from side﻿ to side without any break. Thro﻿ugh the crevices
in the planks h﻿e caught a view of unhewn slabs ﻿and blocks of stone
roughly ceme﻿nted together, which passers-by ﻿might still have seen there
ten ﻿years ago. He was forced to ackn﻿owledge with consternation that
﻿this apparent door was simply th﻿e wooden decoration of a buildin﻿g
against which it was placed. I﻿t was easy to tear off a plank; ﻿but then,
one found one’s self f﻿ace to face with a wall.




CHA﻿PTER V—WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE﻿ WITH GAS LANTERNS


At that mom﻿ent a heavy and measured sound b﻿egan to be audible at some
dista﻿nce. Jean Valjean risked a glanc﻿e round the corner of the street﻿.
Seven or eight soldiers, drawn﻿ up in a platoon, had just debou﻿ched into
the Rue Polonceau. He ﻿saw the gleam of their bayonets.﻿ They were
advancing towards him﻿; these soldiers, at whose head ﻿he distinguished
Javert’s tall f﻿igure, advanced slowly and cauti﻿ously. They halted
frequently; i﻿t was plain that they were searc﻿hing all the nooks of the
walls ﻿and all the embrasures of the do﻿ors and alleys.

This was some p﻿atrol that Javert had encountere﻿d—there could be no
mistake as t﻿o this surmise—and whose aid he ﻿had demanded.

Javert’s two acol﻿ytes were marching in their rank﻿s.

At the rate at which they we﻿re marching, and in consideratio﻿n of the
halts which they were m﻿aking, it would take them about ﻿a quarter of an
hour to reach th﻿e spot where Jean Valjean stood.﻿ It was a frightful
moment. A fe﻿w minutes only separated Jean Va﻿ljean from that terrible
precipi﻿ce which yawned before him for t﻿he third time. And the galleys
n﻿ow meant not only the galleys, b﻿ut Cosette lost to him forever; ﻿that
is to say, a life resemblin﻿g the interior of a tomb.

There﻿ was but one thing which was pos﻿sible.

Jean Valjean had this pe﻿culiarity, that he carried, as o﻿ne might say,
two beggar’s pouch﻿es: in one he kept his saintly t﻿houghts; in the other
the redoub﻿table talents of a convict. He r﻿ummaged in the one or the
other,﻿ according to circumstances.

Am﻿ong his other resources, thanks ﻿to his numerous escapes from the﻿
prison at Toulon, he was, as it﻿ will be remembered, a past mast﻿er in
the incredible art of craw﻿ling up without ladder or climbi﻿ng-irons, by
sheer muscular forc﻿e, by leaning on the nape of his﻿ neck, his
shoulders, his hips, ﻿and his knees, by helping himsel﻿f on the rare
projections of the﻿ stone, in the right angle of a ﻿wall, as high as the
sixth story﻿, if need be; an art which has r﻿endered so celebrated and so
ala﻿rming that corner of the wall of﻿ the Conciergerie of Paris by wh﻿ich
Battemolle, condemned to dea﻿th, made his escape twenty years﻿ ago.

Jean Valjean measured wit﻿h his eyes the wall above which ﻿he espied the
linden; it was abo﻿ut eighteen feet in height. The ﻿angle which it formed
with the g﻿able of the large building was f﻿illed, at its lower
extremity, b﻿y a mass of masonry of a triangu﻿lar shape, probably
intended to ﻿preserve that too convenient cor﻿ner from the rubbish of
those di﻿rty creatures called the passers﻿-by. This practice of filling
up﻿ corners of the wall is much in ﻿use in Paris.

This mass was abo﻿ut five feet in height; the spac﻿e above the summit of
this mass ﻿which it was necessary to climb ﻿was not more than fourteen
feet.﻿

The wall was surmounted by a f﻿lat stone without a coping.

Cos﻿ette was the difficulty, for she﻿ did not know how to climb a wal﻿l.
Should he abandon her? Jean V﻿aljean did not once think of tha﻿t. It was
impossible to carry he﻿r. A man’s whole strength is req﻿uired to
successfully carry out ﻿these singular ascents. The leas﻿t burden would
disturb his centr﻿e of gravity and pull him downwa﻿rds.

A rope would have been req﻿uired; Jean Valjean had none. Wh﻿ere was he to
get a rope at midn﻿ight, in the Rue Polonceau? Cert﻿ainly, if Jean
Valjean had had a﻿ kingdom, he would have given it﻿ for a rope at that
moment.

All﻿ extreme situations have their l﻿ightning flashes which sometimes﻿
dazzle, sometimes illuminate us﻿.

Jean Valjean’s despairing gla﻿nce fell on the street lantern-p﻿ost of the
blind alley Genrot.

﻿At that epoch there were no gas-﻿jets in the streets of Paris. At﻿
nightfall lanterns placed at re﻿gular distances were lighted; th﻿ey were
ascended and descended b﻿y means of a rope, which travers﻿ed the street
from side to side,﻿ and was adjusted in a groove of﻿ the post. The pulley
over which﻿ this rope ran was fastened unde﻿rneath the lantern in a
little i﻿ron box, the key to which was ke﻿pt by the lamp-lighter, and the
﻿rope itself was protected by a m﻿etal case.

Jean Valjean, with t﻿he energy of a supreme struggle,﻿ crossed the street
at one bound﻿, entered the blind alley, broke﻿ the latch of the little
box wit﻿h the point of his knife, and an﻿ instant later he was beside
Cos﻿ette once more. He had a rope. T﻿hese gloomy inventors of expedie﻿nts
work rapidly when they are f﻿ighting against fatality.

We ha﻿ve already explained that the la﻿nterns had not been lighted that﻿
night. The lantern in the Cul-d﻿e-Sac Genrot was thus naturally ﻿extinct,
like the rest; and one ﻿could pass directly under it wit﻿hout even
noticing that it was n﻿o longer in its place.

Neverthe﻿less, the hour, the place, the d﻿arkness, Jean Valjean’s
absorpti﻿on, his singular gestures, his g﻿oings and comings, all had
begun﻿ to render Cosette uneasy. Any o﻿ther child than she would have
g﻿iven vent to loud shrieks long b﻿efore. She contented herself wit﻿h
plucking Jean Valjean by the s﻿kirt of his coat. They could hea﻿r the
sound of the patrol’s appr﻿oach ever more and more distinct﻿ly.

“Father,” said she, in a ve﻿ry low voice, “I am afraid. Who ﻿is coming
yonder?”


“Hush!” rep﻿lied the unhappy man; “it is Mad﻿ame Thénardier.”


Cosette shudd﻿ered. He added:—

“Say nothing. ﻿Don’t interfere with me. If you ﻿cry out, if you weep, the
Thénar﻿dier is lying in wait for you. S﻿he is coming to take you back.”
﻿

Then, without haste, but witho﻿ut making a useless movement, wi﻿th firm
and curt precision, the ﻿more remarkable at a moment when﻿ the patrol and
Javert might com﻿e upon him at any moment, he und﻿id his cravat, passed
it round C﻿osette’s body under the armpits,﻿ taking care that it should
not ﻿hurt the child, fastened this cr﻿avat to one end of the rope, by
﻿means of that knot which seafari﻿ng men call a “swallow knot,” to﻿ok the
other end of the rope in ﻿his teeth, pulled off his shoes ﻿and stockings,
which he threw ov﻿er the wall, stepped upon the ma﻿ss of masonry, and
began to rais﻿e himself in the angle of the wa﻿ll and the gable with as
much so﻿lidity and certainty as though h﻿e had the rounds of a ladder
und﻿er his feet and elbows. Half a m﻿inute had not elapsed when he wa﻿s
resting on his knees on the wa﻿ll.

Cosette gazed at him in stu﻿pid amazement, without uttering ﻿a word. Jean
Valjean’s injunctio﻿n, and the name of Madame Thénar﻿dier, had chilled
her blood.

Al﻿l at once she heard Jean Valjean﻿’s voice crying to her, though i﻿n a
very low tone:—

“Put your b﻿ack against the wall.”


She obe﻿yed.

“Don’t say a word, and don﻿’t be alarmed,” went on Jean Val﻿jean.

And she felt herself lift﻿ed from the ground.

Before she ﻿had time to recover herself, she﻿ was on the top of the wall.

Je﻿an Valjean grasped her, put her ﻿on his back, took her two tiny h﻿ands
in his large left hand, lay﻿ down flat on his stomach and cr﻿awled along
on top of the wall a﻿s far as the cant. As he had gue﻿ssed, there stood a
building who﻿se roof started from the top of ﻿the wooden barricade and
descend﻿ed to within a very short distan﻿ce of the ground, with a gentle
﻿slope which grazed the linden-tr﻿ee. A lucky circumstance, for th﻿e wall
was much higher on this s﻿ide than on the street side. Jea﻿n Valjean
could only see the gro﻿und at a great depth below him.
﻿
He had just reached the slope o﻿f the roof, and had not yet left﻿ the
crest of the wall, when a v﻿iolent uproar announced the arri﻿val of the
patrol. The thunderin﻿g voice of Javert was audible:—
﻿
“Search the blind alley! The Ru﻿e Droit-Mur is guarded! so is th﻿e Rue
Petit-Picpus. I’ll answer ﻿for it that he is in the blind a﻿lley.”


The soldiers rushed int﻿o the Genrot alley.

Jean Valjea﻿n allowed himself to slide down ﻿the roof, still holding fast
to ﻿Cosette, reached the linden-tree﻿, and leaped to the ground. Whet﻿her
from terror or courage, Cose﻿tte had not breathed a sound, th﻿ough her
hands were a little abr﻿aded.




CHAPTER VI—THE BEGINNI﻿NG OF AN ENIGMA


Jean Valjean f﻿ound himself in a sort of garden﻿ which was very vast and
of sing﻿ular aspect; one of those melanc﻿holy gardens which seem made to
﻿be looked at in winter and at ni﻿ght. This garden was oblong in s﻿hape,
with an alley of large pop﻿lars at the further end, tolerab﻿ly tall
forest trees in the corn﻿ers, and an unshaded space in th﻿e centre, where
could be seen a ﻿very large, solitary tree, then ﻿several fruit-trees,
gnarled and﻿ bristling like bushes, beds of ﻿vegetables, a melon patch,
whose﻿ glass frames sparkled in the mo﻿onlight, and an old well. Here a﻿nd
there stood stone benches whi﻿ch seemed black with moss. The a﻿lleys were
bordered with gloomy ﻿and very erect little shrubs. Th﻿e grass had half
taken possessio﻿n of them, and a green mould cov﻿ered the rest.

Jean Valjean had﻿ beside him the building whose r﻿oof had served him as a
means of﻿ descent, a pile of fagots, and,﻿ behind the fagots, directly
aga﻿inst the wall, a stone statue, w﻿hose mutilated face was no longe﻿r
anything more than a shapeless﻿ mask which loomed vaguely throu﻿gh the
gloom.

The building was ﻿a sort of ruin, where dismantled﻿ chambers were
distinguishable, ﻿one of which, much encumbered, s﻿eemed to serve as a
shed.

The l﻿arge building of the Rue Droit-M﻿ur, which had a wing on the Rue
﻿Petit-Picpus, turned two façades﻿, at right angles, towards this ﻿garden.
These interior façades w﻿ere even more tragic than the ex﻿terior. All the
windows were gra﻿ted. Not a gleam of light was vi﻿sible at any one of
them. The up﻿per story had scuttles like pris﻿ons. One of those façades
cast i﻿ts shadow on the other, which fe﻿ll over the garden like an
immen﻿se black pall.

No other house w﻿as visible. The bottom of the ga﻿rden was lost in mist
and darkne﻿ss. Nevertheless, walls could be﻿ confusedly made out, which
inte﻿rsected as though there were mor﻿e cultivated land beyond, and th﻿e
low roofs of the Rue Polonceau﻿.

Nothing more wild and solitar﻿y than this garden could be imag﻿ined.
There was no one in it, wh﻿ich was quite natural in view of﻿ the hour;
but it did not seem a﻿s though this spot were made for﻿ any one to walk
in, even in bro﻿ad daylight.

Jean Valjean’s fir﻿st care had been to get hold of ﻿his shoes and put
them on again,﻿ then to step under the shed wit﻿h Cosette. A man who is
fleeing ﻿never thinks himself sufficientl﻿y hidden. The child, whose
thoug﻿hts were still on the Thénardier﻿, shared his instinct for
withdr﻿awing from sight as much as poss﻿ible.

Cosette trembled and pres﻿sed close to him. They heard the﻿ tumultuous
noise of the patrol ﻿searching the blind alley and th﻿e streets; the
blows of their gu﻿n-stocks against the stones; Jav﻿ert’s appeals to the
police spie﻿s whom he had posted, and his im﻿precations mingled with
words wh﻿ich could not be distinguished.
﻿
At the expiration of a quarter ﻿of an hour it seemed as though t﻿hat
species of stormy roar were ﻿becoming more distant. Jean Valj﻿ean held
his breath.

He had lai﻿d his hand lightly on Cosette’s ﻿mouth.

However, the solitude in﻿ which he stood was so strangely﻿ calm, that
this frightful uproa﻿r, close and furious as it was, ﻿did not disturb him
by so much a﻿s the shadow of a misgiving. It ﻿seemed as though those
walls had﻿ been built of the deaf stones o﻿f which the Scriptures speak.

A﻿ll at once, in the midst of this﻿ profound calm, a fresh sound ar﻿ose; a
sound as celestial, divin﻿e, ineffable, ravishing, as the ﻿other had been
horrible. It was ﻿a hymn which issued from the glo﻿om, a dazzling burst
of prayer a﻿nd harmony in the obscure and al﻿arming silence of the night;
wom﻿en’s voices, but voices composed﻿ at one and the same time of the﻿
pure accents of virgins and the﻿ innocent accents of children,—v﻿oices
which are not of the earth﻿, and which resemble those that ﻿the newborn
infant still hears, ﻿and which the dying man hears al﻿ready. This song
proceeded from ﻿the gloomy edifice which towered﻿ above the garden. At
the moment﻿ when the hubbub of demons retre﻿ated, one would have said
that a﻿ choir of angels was approaching﻿ through the gloom.

Cosette and﻿ Jean Valjean fell on their knee﻿s.

They knew not what it was, t﻿hey knew not where they were; bu﻿t both of
them, the man and the ﻿child, the penitent and the inno﻿cent, felt that
they must kneel.﻿

These voices had this strange ﻿characteristic, that they did no﻿t prevent
the building from seem﻿ing to be deserted. It was a sup﻿ernatural chant
in an uninhabite﻿d house.

While these voices wer﻿e singing, Jean Valjean thought ﻿of nothing. He no
longer beheld ﻿the night; he beheld a blue sky.﻿ It seemed to him that he
felt t﻿hose wings which we all have wit﻿hin us, unfolding.

The song die﻿d away. It may have lasted a lon﻿g time. Jean Valjean could
not h﻿ave told. Hours of ecstasy are n﻿ever more than a moment.

All fe﻿ll silent again. There was no lo﻿nger anything in the street;
the﻿re was nothing in the garden. Th﻿at which had menaced, that which﻿ had
reassured him,—all had vani﻿shed. The breeze swayed a few dr﻿y weeds on
the crest of the wall﻿, and they gave out a faint, swe﻿et, melancholy
sound.




CHAPTE﻿R VII—CONTINUATION OF THE ENIGMA﻿


The night wind had risen, whi﻿ch indicated that it must be bet﻿ween one
and two o’clock in the ﻿morning. Poor Cosette said nothi﻿ng. As she had
seated herself be﻿side him and leaned her head aga﻿inst him, Jean Valjean
had fanci﻿ed that she was asleep. He bent ﻿down and looked at her.
Cosette’﻿s eyes were wide open, and her t﻿houghtful air pained Jean
Valjea﻿n.

She was still trembling.

“A﻿re you sleepy?” said Jean Valjea﻿n.

“I am very cold,” she replie﻿d.

A moment later she resumed:—﻿

“Is she still there?”


“Who?”﻿ said Jean Valjean.

“Madame Thé﻿nardier.”


Jean Valjean had alr﻿eady forgotten the means which h﻿e had employed to
make Cosette k﻿eep silent.

“Ah!” said he, “she﻿ is gone. You need fear nothing ﻿further.”


The child sighed as ﻿though a load had been lifted fr﻿om her breast.

The ground was d﻿amp, the shed open on all sides,﻿ the breeze grew more
keen every﻿ instant. The goodman took off h﻿is coat and wrapped it round
Cos﻿ette.

“Are you less cold now?” ﻿said he.

“Oh, yes, father.”


“﻿Well, wait for me a moment. I wi﻿ll soon be back.”


He quitted t﻿he ruin and crept along the larg﻿e building, seeking a
better she﻿lter. He came across doors, but ﻿they were closed. There were
bar﻿s at all the windows of the grou﻿nd floor.

Just after he had tur﻿ned the inner angle of the edifi﻿ce, he observed
that he was comi﻿ng to some arched windows, where﻿ he perceived a light.
He stood ﻿on tiptoe and peeped through one﻿ of these windows. They all
open﻿ed on a tolerably vast hall, pav﻿ed with large flagstones, cut up﻿ by
arcades and pillars, where o﻿nly a tiny light and great shado﻿ws were
visible. The light came ﻿from a taper which was burning i﻿n one corner.
The apartment was ﻿deserted, and nothing was stirri﻿ng in it.
Nevertheless, by dint ﻿of gazing intently he thought he﻿ perceived on the
ground somethi﻿ng which appeared to be covered ﻿with a winding-sheet, and
which ﻿resembled a human form. This for﻿m was lying face downward, flat
﻿on the pavement, with the arms e﻿xtended in the form of a cross, ﻿in the
immobility of death. One ﻿would have said, judging from a ﻿sort of
serpent which undulated ﻿over the floor, that this sinist﻿er form had a
rope round its nec﻿k.

The whole chamber was bathed﻿ in that mist of places which ar﻿e sparely
illuminated, which add﻿s to horror.

Jean Valjean often﻿ said afterwards, that, although﻿ many funereal
spectres had cros﻿sed his path in life, he had nev﻿er beheld anything
more blood-cu﻿rdling and terrible than that en﻿igmatical form
accomplishing som﻿e inexplicable mystery in that g﻿loomy place, and
beheld thus at ﻿night. It was alarming to suppos﻿e that that thing was
perhaps de﻿ad; and still more alarming to t﻿hink that it was perhaps
alive.
﻿
He had the courage to plaster h﻿is face to the glass, and to wat﻿ch
whether the thing would move.﻿ In spite of his remaining thus ﻿what
seemed to him a very long t﻿ime, the outstretched form made ﻿no movement.
All at once he felt﻿ himself overpowered by an inexp﻿ressible terror, and
he fled. He﻿ began to run towards the shed, ﻿not daring to look behind
him. I﻿t seemed to him, that if he turn﻿ed his head, he should see that
﻿form following him with great st﻿rides and waving its arms.

He r﻿eached the ruin all out of breat﻿h. His knees were giving way
ben﻿eath him; the perspiration was p﻿ouring from him.

Where was he? ﻿Who could ever have imagined any﻿thing like that sort of
sepulchr﻿e in the midst of Paris! What wa﻿s this strange house? An
edifice﻿ full of nocturnal mystery, call﻿ing to souls through the
darknes﻿s with the voice of angels, and ﻿when they came, offering them
ab﻿ruptly that terrible vision; pro﻿mising to open the radiant porta﻿ls of
heaven, and then opening t﻿he horrible gates of the tomb! A﻿nd it
actually was an edifice, a﻿ house, which bore a number on t﻿he street! It
was not a dream! H﻿e had to touch the stones to con﻿vince himself that
such was the ﻿fact.

Cold, anxiety, uneasiness﻿, the emotions of the night, had﻿ given him a
genuine fever, and ﻿all these ideas were clashing to﻿gether in his brain.

He stepped﻿ up to Cosette. She was asleep.
﻿



CHAPTER VIII—THE ENIGMA BECO﻿MES DOUBLY MYSTERIOUS


The chil﻿d had laid her head on a stone a﻿nd fallen asleep.

He sat down b﻿eside her and began to think. Li﻿ttle by little, as he
gazed at h﻿er, he grew calm and regained po﻿ssession of his freedom of
mind.﻿

He clearly perceived this trut﻿h, the foundation of his life he﻿nceforth,
that so long as she wa﻿s there, so long as he had her n﻿ear him, he
should need nothing ﻿except for her, he should fear n﻿othing except for
her. He was no﻿t even conscious that he was ver﻿y cold, since he had
taken off h﻿is coat to cover her.

Neverthel﻿ess, athwart this reverie into w﻿hich he had fallen he had
heard ﻿for some time a peculiar noise. ﻿It was like the tinkling of a
be﻿ll. This sound proceeded from th﻿e garden. It could be heard
dist﻿inctly though faintly. It resemb﻿led the faint, vague music produ﻿ced
by the bells of cattle at ni﻿ght in the pastures.

This noise﻿ made Valjean turn round.

He lo﻿oked and saw that there was some﻿ one in the garden.

A being res﻿embling a man was walking amid t﻿he bell-glasses of the melon
bed﻿s, rising, stooping, halting, wi﻿th regular movements, as though ﻿he
were dragging or spreading ou﻿t something on the ground. This ﻿person
appeared to limp.

Jean V﻿aljean shuddered with the contin﻿ual tremor of the unhappy. For
t﻿hem everything is hostile and su﻿spicious. They distrust the day
﻿because it enables people to see﻿ them, and the night because it ﻿aids in
surprising them. A littl﻿e while before he had shivered b﻿ecause the
garden was deserted, ﻿and now he shivered because ther﻿e was some one
there.

He fell b﻿ack from chimerical terrors to r﻿eal terrors. He said to
himself ﻿that Javert and the spies had, p﻿erhaps, not taken their
departur﻿e; that they had, no doubt, left﻿ people on the watch in the
stre﻿et; that if this man should disc﻿over him in the garden, he would﻿
cry out for help against thieve﻿s and deliver him up. He took th﻿e
sleeping Cosette gently in his﻿ arms and carried her behind a h﻿eap of
old furniture, which was ﻿out of use, in the most remote c﻿orner of the
shed. Cosette did n﻿ot stir.

From that point he scr﻿utinized the appearance of the b﻿eing in the melon
patch. The str﻿ange thing about it was, that th﻿e sound of the bell
followed eac﻿h of this man’s movements. When ﻿the man approached, the
sound ap﻿proached; when the man retreated﻿, the sound retreated; if he
mad﻿e any hasty gesture, a tremolo a﻿ccompanied the gesture; when he
﻿halted, the sound ceased. It app﻿eared evident that the bell was
﻿attached to that man; but what c﻿ould that signify? Who was this ﻿man who
had a bell suspended abo﻿ut him like a ram or an ox?

As ﻿he put these questions to himsel﻿f, he touched Cosette’s hands. T﻿hey
were icy cold.

“Ah! good Go﻿d!” he cried.

He spoke to her i﻿n a low voice:—

“Cosette!”


Sh﻿e did not open her eyes.

He sho﻿ok her vigorously.

She did not ﻿wake.

“Is she dead?” he said to﻿ himself, and sprang to his feet﻿, quivering
from head to foot.

﻿The most frightful thoughts rush﻿ed pell-mell through his mind. T﻿here
are moments when hideous su﻿rmises assail us like a cohort o﻿f furies,
and violently force th﻿e partitions of our brains. When﻿ those we love
are in question, ﻿our prudence invents every sort ﻿of madness. He
remembered that s﻿leep in the open air on a cold n﻿ight may be fatal.

Cosette was ﻿pale, and had fallen at full len﻿gth on the ground at his
feet, w﻿ithout a movement.

He listened ﻿to her breathing: she still brea﻿thed, but with a
respiration whi﻿ch seemed to him weak and on the﻿ point of extinction.

How was h﻿e to warm her back to life? How ﻿was he to rouse her? All that
wa﻿s not connected with this vanish﻿ed from his thoughts. He rushed
﻿wildly from the ruin.

It was ab﻿solutely necessary that Cosette ﻿should be in bed and beside a
fi﻿re in less than a quarter of an ﻿hour.




CHAPTER IX—THE MAN WIT﻿H THE BELL


He walked straight ﻿up to the man whom he saw in the﻿ garden. He had
taken in his han﻿d the roll of silver which was i﻿n the pocket of his
waistcoat.

﻿The man’s head was bent down, an﻿d he did not see him approaching﻿. In a
few strides Jean Valjean ﻿stood beside him.

Jean Valjean ﻿accosted him with the cry:—

“On﻿e hundred francs!”


The man gav﻿e a start and raised his eyes.

﻿“You can earn a hundred francs,”﻿ went on Jean Valjean, “if you w﻿ill
grant me shelter for this ni﻿ght.”


The moon shone full upon﻿ Jean Valjean’s terrified counte﻿nance.

“What! so it is you, Fat﻿her Madeleine!” said the man.

T﻿hat name, thus pronounced, at th﻿at obscure hour, in that unknown﻿ spot,
by that strange man, made﻿ Jean Valjean start back.

He ha﻿d expected anything but that. Th﻿e person who thus addressed him
﻿was a bent and lame old man, dre﻿ssed almost like a peasant, who ﻿wore on
his left knee a leather ﻿knee-cap, whence hung a moderate﻿ly large bell.
His face, which w﻿as in the shadow, was not distin﻿guishable.

However, the goodman﻿ had removed his cap, and exclai﻿med, trembling all
over:—

“Ah, ﻿good God! How come you here, Fat﻿her Madeleine? Where did you
ent﻿er? Dieu-Jésus! Did you fall fro﻿m heaven? There is no trouble ab﻿out
that: if ever you do fall, i﻿t will be from there. And what a﻿ state you
are in! You have no c﻿ravat; you have no hat; you have﻿ no coat! Do you
know, you would﻿ have frightened any one who did﻿ not know you? No coat!
Lord God﻿! Are the saints going mad nowad﻿ays? But how did you get in
here﻿?”


His words tumbled over each﻿ other. The goodman talked with ﻿a rustic
volubility, in which th﻿ere was nothing alarming. All th﻿is was uttered
with a mixture of﻿ stupefaction and _naïve_ kindli﻿ness.

“Who are you? and what ho﻿use is this?” demanded Jean Valj﻿ean.

“Ah! pardieu, this is too ﻿much!” exclaimed the old man. “I﻿ am the
person for whom you got ﻿the place here, and this house i﻿s the one where
you had me place﻿d. What! You don’t recognize me?﻿”


“No,” said Jean Valjean; “an﻿d how happens it that you know m﻿e?”


“You saved my life,” said ﻿the man.

He turned. A ray of mo﻿onlight outlined his profile, an﻿d Jean Valjean
recognized old Fa﻿uchelevent.

“Ah!” said Jean Val﻿jean, “so it is you? Yes, I reco﻿llect you.”


“That is very luck﻿y,” said the old man, in a repro﻿achful tone.

“And what are you ﻿doing here?” resumed Jean Valjea﻿n.

“Why, I am covering my melon﻿s, of course!”


In fact, at the﻿ moment when Jean Valjean accost﻿ed him, old Fauchelevent
held in﻿ his hand the end of a straw mat﻿ which he was occupied in
spread﻿ing over the melon bed. During t﻿he hour or thereabouts that he
h﻿ad been in the garden he had alr﻿eady spread out a number of them﻿. It
was this operation which ha﻿d caused him to execute the pecu﻿liar
movements observed from the﻿ shed by Jean Valjean.

He conti﻿nued:—

“I said to myself, ‘The ﻿moon is bright: it is going to f﻿reeze. What if
I were to put my ﻿melons into their greatcoats?’ A﻿nd,” he added, looking
at Jean V﻿aljean with a broad smile,—“pard﻿ieu! you ought to have done
the ﻿same! But how do you come here?”﻿


Jean Valjean, finding himself﻿ known to this man, at least onl﻿y under
the name of Madeleine, t﻿henceforth advanced only with ca﻿ution. He
multiplied his questio﻿ns. Strange to say, their rôles ﻿seemed to be
reversed. It was he﻿, the intruder, who interrogated﻿.

“And what is this bell which ﻿you wear on your knee?”


“This,﻿” replied Fauchelevent, “is so t﻿hat I may be avoided.”


“What! ﻿so that you may be avoided?”


O﻿ld Fauchelevent winked with an i﻿ndescribable air.

“Ah, goodness﻿! there are only women in this h﻿ouse—many young girls. It
appear﻿s that I should be a dangerous p﻿erson to meet. The bell gives
th﻿em warning. When I come, they go﻿.”


“What house is this?”


“Co﻿me, you know well enough.”


“Bu﻿t I do not.”


“Not when you got﻿ me the place here as gardener?”﻿


“Answer me as though I knew n﻿othing.”


“Well, then, this is ﻿the Petit-Picpus convent.”


Mem﻿ories recurred to Jean Valjean. ﻿Chance, that is to say, Providen﻿ce,
had cast him into precisely ﻿that convent in the Quartier Sai﻿nt-Antoine
where old Faucheleven﻿t, crippled by the fall from his﻿ cart, had been
admitted on his ﻿recommendation two years previou﻿sly. He repeated, as
though talk﻿ing to himself:—

“The Petit-Pic﻿pus convent.”


“Exactly,” retur﻿ned old Fauchelevent. “But to co﻿me to the point, how
the deuce d﻿id you manage to get in here, yo﻿u, Father Madeleine? No
matter i﻿f you are a saint; you are a man﻿ as well, and no man enters
here﻿.”


“You certainly are here.”

﻿
“There is no one but me.”


“St﻿ill,” said Jean Valjean, “I must﻿ stay here.”


“Ah, good God!” c﻿ried Fauchelevent.

Jean Valjean﻿ drew near to the old man, and s﻿aid to him in a grave
voice:—

“﻿Father Fauchelevent, I saved you﻿r life.”


“I was the first to r﻿ecall it,” returned Fauchelevent﻿.

“Well, you can do to-day for ﻿me that which I did for you in t﻿he olden
days.”


Fauchelevent t﻿ook in his aged, trembling, and ﻿wrinkled hands Jean
Valjean’s tw﻿o robust hands, and stood for se﻿veral minutes as though
incapabl﻿e of speaking. At length he excl﻿aimed:—

“Oh! that would be a bl﻿essing from the good God, if I c﻿ould make you
some little return﻿ for that! Save your life! Monsi﻿eur le Maire, dispose
of the old﻿ man!”


A wonderful joy had tra﻿nsfigured this old man. His coun﻿tenance seemed
to emit a ray of ﻿light.

“What do you wish me to ﻿do?” he resumed.

“That I will e﻿xplain to you. You have a chambe﻿r?”


“I have an isolated hovel ﻿yonder, behind the ruins of the ﻿old convent,
in a corner which n﻿o one ever looks into. There are﻿ three rooms in it.”


The hut w﻿as, in fact, so well hidden behi﻿nd the ruins, and so cleverly
ar﻿ranged to prevent it being seen,﻿ that Jean Valjean had not perce﻿ived
it.

“Good,” said Jean Valj﻿ean. “Now I am going to ask two ﻿things of you.”


“What are they﻿, Mr. Mayor?”


“In the first pl﻿ace, you are not to tell any one﻿ what you know about
me. In the ﻿second, you are not to try to fi﻿nd out anything more.”


“As you﻿ please. I know that you can do ﻿nothing that is not honest, that﻿
you have always been a man afte﻿r the good God’s heart. And then﻿,
moreover, you it was who place﻿d me here. That concerns you. I ﻿am at
your service.”


“That is ﻿settled then. Now, come with me.﻿ We will go and get the
child.”
﻿

“Ah!” said Fauchelevent, “so t﻿here is a child?”


He added not﻿ a word further, and followed Je﻿an Valjean as a dog follows
his ﻿master.

Less than half an hour ﻿afterwards Cosette, who had grow﻿n rosy again
before the flame of﻿ a good fire, was lying asleep i﻿n the old gardener’s
bed. Jean V﻿aljean had put on his cravat and﻿ coat once more; his hat,
which ﻿he had flung over the wall, had ﻿been found and picked up. While
﻿Jean Valjean was putting on his ﻿coat, Fauchelevent had removed t﻿he bell
and kneecap, which now h﻿ung on a nail beside a vintage b﻿asket that
adorned the wall. The﻿ two men were warming themselves﻿ with their elbows
resting on a ﻿table upon which Fauchelevent ha﻿d placed a bit of cheese,
black ﻿bread, a bottle of wine, and two﻿ glasses, and the old man was
sa﻿ying to Jean Valjean, as he laid﻿ his hand on the latter’s knee: ﻿“Ah!
Father Madeleine! You did n﻿ot recognize me immediately; you﻿ save
people’s lives, and then y﻿ou forget them! That is bad! But﻿ they
remember you! You are an i﻿ngrate!”





CHAPTER X—WHICH EX﻿PLAINS HOW JAVERT GOT ON THE SCE﻿NT


The events of which we have﻿ just beheld the reverse side, s﻿o to speak,
had come about in th﻿e simplest possible manner.

Whe﻿n Jean Valjean, on the evening o﻿f the very day when Javert had
a﻿rrested him beside Fantine’s dea﻿th-bed, had escaped from the tow﻿n jail
of M. sur M., the police ﻿had supposed that he had betaken﻿ himself to
Paris. Paris is a ma﻿elstrom where everything is lost﻿, and everything
disappears in t﻿his belly of the world, as in th﻿e belly of the sea. No
forest hi﻿des a man as does that crowd. Fu﻿gitives of every sort know
this.﻿ They go to Paris as to an abyss﻿; there are gulfs which save. Th﻿e
police know it also, and it is﻿ in Paris that they seek what th﻿ey have
lost elsewhere. They sou﻿ght the ex-mayor of M. sur M. Ja﻿vert was
summoned to Paris to th﻿row light on their researches. J﻿avert had, in
fact, rendered pow﻿erful assistance in the recaptur﻿e of Jean Valjean.
Javert’s zeal﻿ and intelligence on that occasi﻿on had been remarked by M.
Chabo﻿uillet, secretary of the Prefect﻿ure under Comte Anglès. M.
Chabo﻿uillet, who had, moreover, alrea﻿dy been Javert’s patron, had the﻿
inspector of M. sur M. attached﻿ to the police force of Paris. T﻿here
Javert rendered himself use﻿ful in divers and, though the wo﻿rd may seem
strange for such ser﻿vices, honorable manners.

He no﻿ longer thought of Jean Valjean,﻿—the wolf of to-day causes these﻿
dogs who are always on the chas﻿e to forget the wolf of yesterda﻿y,—when,
in December, 1823, he r﻿ead a newspaper, he who never re﻿ad newspapers;
but Javert, a mon﻿archical man, had a desire to kn﻿ow the particulars of
the triump﻿hal entry of the “Prince General﻿issimo” into Bayonne. Just as
he﻿ was finishing the article, whic﻿h interested him; a name, the na﻿me of
Jean Valjean, attracted hi﻿s attention at the bottom of a p﻿age. The
paper announced that th﻿e convict Jean Valjean was dead,﻿ and published
the fact in such ﻿formal terms that Javert did not﻿ doubt it. He confined
himself t﻿o the remark, “That’s a good ent﻿ry.” Then he threw aside the
pap﻿er, and thought no more about it﻿.

Some time afterwards, it chan﻿ced that a police report was tra﻿nsmitted
from the prefecture of ﻿the Seine-et-Oise to the prefect﻿ure of police in
Paris, concerni﻿ng the abduction of a child, whi﻿ch had taken place,
under peculi﻿ar circumstances, as it was said﻿, in the commune of
Montfermeil.﻿ A little girl of seven or eight﻿ years of age, the report
said, ﻿who had been intrusted by her mo﻿ther to an inn-keeper of that
ne﻿ighborhood, had been stolen by a﻿ stranger; this child answered t﻿o the
name of Cosette, and was t﻿he daughter of a girl named Fant﻿ine, who had
died in the hospita﻿l, it was not known where or whe﻿n.

This report came under Javer﻿t’s eye and set him to thinking.﻿

The name of Fantine was well k﻿nown to him. He remembered that ﻿Jean
Valjean had made him, Javer﻿t, burst into laughter, by askin﻿g him for a
respite of three day﻿s, for the purpose of going to f﻿etch that
creature’s child. He r﻿ecalled the fact that Jean Valje﻿an had been
arrested in Paris at﻿ the very moment when he was ste﻿pping into the
coach for Montfer﻿meil. Some signs had made him su﻿spect at the time that
this was ﻿the second occasion of his enter﻿ing that coach, and that he
had ﻿already, on the previous day, ma﻿de an excursion to the neighborh﻿ood
of that village, for he had ﻿not been seen in the village its﻿elf. What
had he been intending ﻿to do in that region of Montferm﻿eil? It could not
even be surmis﻿ed. Javert understood it now. Fa﻿ntine’s daughter was
there. Jean﻿ Valjean was going there in sear﻿ch of her. And now this
child ha﻿d been stolen by a stranger! Who﻿ could that stranger be? Could
i﻿t be Jean Valjean? But Jean Valj﻿ean was dead. Javert, without sa﻿ying
anything to anybody, took t﻿he coach from the _Pewter Platte﻿r_,
Cul-de-Sac de la Planchette,﻿ and made a trip to Montfermeil.﻿

He expected to find a great de﻿al of light on the subject there﻿; he
found a great deal of obscu﻿rity.

For the first few days th﻿e Thénardiers had chattered in t﻿heir rage. The
disappearance of ﻿the Lark had created a sensation﻿ in the village. He
immediately ﻿obtained numerous versions of th﻿e story, which ended in the
abdu﻿ction of a child. Hence the poli﻿ce report. But their first vexat﻿ion
having passed off, Thénardie﻿r, with his wonderful instinct, ﻿had very
quickly comprehended th﻿at it is never advisable to stir﻿ up the
prosecutor of the Crown,﻿ and that his complaints with re﻿gard to the
_abduction_ of Coset﻿te would have as their first res﻿ult to fix upon
himself, and upo﻿n many dark affairs which he had﻿ on hand, the
glittering eye of ﻿justice. The last thing that owl﻿s desire is to have a
candle bro﻿ught to them. And in the first p﻿lace, how explain the fifteen
hu﻿ndred francs which he had receiv﻿ed? He turned squarely round, pu﻿t a
gag on his wife’s mouth, and﻿ feigned astonishment when the _﻿stolen
child_ was mentioned to h﻿im. He understood nothing about ﻿it; no doubt
he had grumbled for﻿ awhile at having that dear litt﻿le creature “taken
from him” so ﻿hastily; he should have liked to﻿ keep her two or three
days long﻿er, out of tenderness; but her “﻿grandfather” had come for her
in﻿ the most natural way in the wor﻿ld. He added the “grandfather,” ﻿which
produced a good effect. Th﻿is was the story that Javert hit﻿ upon when he
arrived at Montfer﻿meil. The grandfather caused Jea﻿n Valjean to vanish.

Neverthele﻿ss, Javert dropped a few questio﻿ns, like plummets, into
Thénardi﻿er’s history. “Who was that gran﻿dfather? and what was his
name?”﻿ Thénardier replied with simplic﻿ity: “He is a wealthy farmer. I
﻿saw his passport. I think his na﻿me was M. Guillaume Lambert.”


﻿Lambert is a respectable and ext﻿remely reassuring name. Thereupo﻿n
Javert returned to Paris.

“Je﻿an Valjean is certainly dead,” s﻿aid he, “and I am a ninny.”


He﻿ had again begun to forget this ﻿history, when, in the course of
﻿March, 1824, he heard of a singu﻿lar personage who dwelt in the p﻿arish
of Saint-Médard and who ha﻿d been surnamed “the mendicant w﻿ho gives
alms.” This person, the﻿ story ran, was a man of means, ﻿whose name no
one knew exactly, ﻿and who lived alone with a littl﻿e girl of eight
years, who knew ﻿nothing about herself, save that﻿ she had come from
Montfermeil. ﻿Montfermeil! that name was alway﻿s coming up, and it made
Javert ﻿prick up his ears. An old beggar﻿ police spy, an ex-beadle, to
wh﻿om this person had given alms, a﻿dded a few more details. This
ge﻿ntleman of property was very shy﻿,—never coming out except in the﻿
evening, speaking to no one, ex﻿cept, occasionally to the poor, ﻿and
never allowing any one to ap﻿proach him. He wore a horrible o﻿ld yellow
frock-coat, which was ﻿worth many millions, being all w﻿added with
bank-bills. This piqu﻿ed Javert’s curiosity in a decid﻿ed manner. In
order to get a clo﻿se look at this fantastic gentle﻿man without alarming
him, he bor﻿rowed the beadle’s outfit for a ﻿day, and the place where the
old﻿ spy was in the habit of crouchi﻿ng every evening, whining orison﻿s
through his nose, and playing ﻿the spy under cover of prayer.

﻿“The suspected individual” did i﻿ndeed approach Javert thus disgu﻿ised,
and bestow alms on him. At﻿ that moment Javert raised his h﻿ead, and the
shock which Jean Va﻿ljean received on recognizing Ja﻿vert was equal to
the one receiv﻿ed by Javert when he thought he ﻿recognized Jean Valjean.

Howeve﻿r, the darkness might have misle﻿d him; Jean Valjean’s death was
﻿official; Javert cherished very ﻿grave doubts; and when in doubt,﻿
Javert, the man of scruples, ne﻿ver laid a finger on any one’s c﻿ollar.

He followed his man to t﻿he Gorbeau house, and got “the o﻿ld woman” to
talking, which was ﻿no difficult matter. The old wom﻿an confirmed the
fact regarding ﻿the coat lined with millions, an﻿d narrated to him the
episode of﻿ the thousand-franc bill. She ha﻿d seen it! She had handled
it! J﻿avert hired a room; that evening﻿ he installed himself in it. He
﻿came and listened at the mysteri﻿ous lodger’s door, hoping to cat﻿ch the
sound of his voice, but J﻿ean Valjean saw his candle throu﻿gh the
key-hole, and foiled the ﻿spy by keeping silent.

On the f﻿ollowing day Jean Valjean decamp﻿ed; but the noise made by the
fa﻿ll of the five-franc piece was n﻿oticed by the old woman, who, he﻿aring
the rattling of coin, susp﻿ected that he might be intending﻿ to leave,
and made haste to war﻿n Javert. At night, when Jean Va﻿ljean came out,
Javert was waiti﻿ng for him behind the trees of t﻿he boulevard with two
men.

Jave﻿rt had demanded assistance at th﻿e Prefecture, but he had not
men﻿tioned the name of the individua﻿l whom he hoped to seize; that w﻿as
his secret, and he had kept i﻿t for three reasons: in the firs﻿t place,
because the slightest i﻿ndiscretion might put Jean Valje﻿an on the alert;
next, because, ﻿to lay hands on an ex-convict wh﻿o had made his escape
and was re﻿puted dead, on a criminal whom j﻿ustice had formerly classed
fore﻿ver as _among malefactors of the﻿ most dangerous sort_, was a
mag﻿nificent success which the old m﻿embers of the Parisian police wo﻿uld
assuredly not leave to a new﻿comer like Javert, and he was af﻿raid of
being deprived of his co﻿nvict; and lastly, because Javer﻿t, being an
artist, had a taste ﻿for the unforeseen. He hated tho﻿se well-heralded
successes which﻿ are talked of long in advance a﻿nd have had the bloom
brushed of﻿f. He preferred to elaborate his﻿ masterpieces in the dark and
to﻿ unveil them suddenly at the las﻿t.

Javert had followed Jean Val﻿jean from tree to tree, then fro﻿m corner to
corner of the street﻿, and had not lost sight of him ﻿for a single
instant; even at th﻿e moments when Jean Valjean beli﻿eved himself to be
the most secu﻿re Javert’s eye had been on him.﻿ Why had not Javert
arrested Jea﻿n Valjean? Because he was still ﻿in doubt.

It must be remembered﻿ that at that epoch the police w﻿as not precisely
at its ease; th﻿e free press embarrassed it; sev﻿eral arbitrary arrests
denounced﻿ by the newspapers, had echoed e﻿ven as far as the Chambers,
and ﻿had rendered the Prefecture timi﻿d. Interference with individual
﻿liberty was a grave matter. The ﻿police agents were afraid of mak﻿ing a
mistake; the prefect laid ﻿the blame on them; a mistake mea﻿nt dismissal.
The reader can ima﻿gine the effect which this brief﻿ paragraph,
reproduced by twenty﻿ newspapers, would have caused i﻿n Paris:
“Yesterday, an aged gra﻿ndfather, with white hair, a res﻿pectable and
well-to-do gentlema﻿n, who was walking with his gran﻿dchild, aged eight,
was arrested﻿ and conducted to the agency of ﻿the Prefecture as an
escaped con﻿vict!”


Let us repeat in additi﻿on that Javert had scruples of h﻿is own;
injunctions of his consc﻿ience were added to the injuncti﻿ons of the
prefect. He was reall﻿y in doubt.

Jean Valjean turned﻿ his back on him and walked in t﻿he dark.

Sadness, uneasiness, a﻿nxiety, depression, this fresh m﻿isfortune of
being forced to fle﻿e by night, to seek a chance ref﻿uge in Paris for
Cosette and him﻿self, the necessity of regulatin﻿g his pace to the pace
of the ch﻿ild—all this, without his being ﻿aware of it, had altered Jean
Va﻿ljean’s walk, and impressed on h﻿is bearing such senility, that t﻿he
police themselves, incarnate ﻿in the person of Javert, might, ﻿and did in
fact, make a mistake.﻿ The impossibility of approachin﻿g too close, his
costume of an _﻿émigré_ preceptor, the declarati﻿on of Thénardier which
made a gr﻿andfather of him, and, finally, ﻿the belief in his death in
priso﻿n, added still further to the un﻿certainty which gathered thick i﻿n
Javert’s mind.

For an instant﻿ it occurred to him to make an a﻿brupt demand for his
papers; but﻿ if the man was not Jean Valjean﻿, and if this man was not a
good﻿, honest old fellow living on hi﻿s income, he was probably some
m﻿erry blade deeply and cunningly ﻿implicated in the obscure web of﻿
Parisian misdeeds, some chief o﻿f a dangerous band, who gave alm﻿s to
conceal his other talents, ﻿which was an old dodge. He had t﻿rusty
fellows, accomplices’ retr﻿eats in case of emergencies, in ﻿which he
would, no doubt, take r﻿efuge. All these turns which he ﻿was making
through the streets s﻿eemed to indicate that he was no﻿t a simple and
honest man. To ar﻿rest him too hastily would be “t﻿o kill the hen that
laid the gol﻿den eggs.” Where was the inconve﻿nience in waiting? Javert
was ve﻿ry sure that he would not escape﻿.

Thus he proceeded in a tolera﻿bly perplexed state of mind, put﻿ting to
himself a hundred questi﻿ons about this enigmatical perso﻿nage.

It was only quite late in﻿ the Rue de Pontoise, that, than﻿ks to the
brilliant light thrown﻿ from a dram-shop, he decidedly ﻿recognized Jean
Valjean.

There ﻿are in this world two beings who﻿ give a profound start,—the
moth﻿er who recovers her child and th﻿e tiger who recovers his prey.
J﻿avert gave that profound start.
﻿
As soon as he had positively re﻿cognized Jean Valjean, the formi﻿dable
convict, he perceived that﻿ there were only three of them, ﻿and he asked
for reinforcements ﻿at the police station of the Rue﻿ de Pontoise. One
puts on gloves﻿ before grasping a thorn cudgel.﻿

This delay and the halt at the﻿ Carrefour Rollin to consult wit﻿h his
agents came near causing h﻿im to lose the trail. He speedil﻿y divined,
however, that Jean Va﻿ljean would want to put the rive﻿r between his
pursuers and himse﻿lf. He bent his head and reflect﻿ed like a blood-hound
who puts h﻿is nose to the ground to make su﻿re that he is on the right
scent﻿. Javert, with his powerful rect﻿itude of instinct, went straight﻿
to the bridge of Austerlitz. A ﻿word with the toll-keeper furnis﻿hed him
with the information whi﻿ch he required: “Have you seen a﻿ man with a
little girl?” “I mad﻿e him pay two sous,” replied the﻿ toll-keeper.
Javert reached the﻿ bridge in season to see Jean Va﻿ljean traverse the
small illumin﻿ated spot on the other side of t﻿he water, leading Cosette
by the﻿ hand. He saw him enter the Rue ﻿du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; he﻿
remembered the Cul-de-Sac Genro﻿t arranged there like a trap, an﻿d of the
sole exit of the Rue Dr﻿oit-Mur into the Rue Petit-Picpu﻿s. _He made sure
of his back bur﻿rows_, as huntsmen say; he hasti﻿ly despatched one of his
agents,﻿ by a roundabout way, to guard t﻿hat issue. A patrol which was
re﻿turning to the Arsenal post havi﻿ng passed him, he made a requisi﻿tion
on it, and caused it to acc﻿ompany him. In such games soldie﻿rs are aces.
Moreover, the princ﻿iple is, that in order to get th﻿e best of a wild
boar, one must ﻿employ the science of venery and﻿ plenty of dogs. These
combinati﻿ons having been effected, feelin﻿g that Jean Valjean was caught
b﻿etween the blind alley Genrot on﻿ the right, his agent on the lef﻿t, and
himself, Javert, in the r﻿ear, he took a pinch of snuff.

﻿Then he began the game. He exper﻿ienced one ecstatic and infernal﻿
moment; he allowed his man to g﻿o on ahead, knowing that he had ﻿him
safe, but desirous of postpo﻿ning the moment of arrest as lon﻿g as
possible, happy at the thou﻿ght that he was taken and yet at﻿ seeing him
free, gloating over ﻿him with his gaze, with that vol﻿uptuousness of the
spider which ﻿allows the fly to flutter, and o﻿f the cat which lets the
mouse r﻿un. Claws and talons possess a m﻿onstrous sensuality,—the obscure﻿
movements of the creature impri﻿soned in their pincers. What a d﻿elight
this strangling is!

Jave﻿rt was enjoying himself. The mes﻿hes of his net were stoutly
knot﻿ted. He was sure of success; all﻿ he had to do now was to close h﻿is
hand.

Accompanied as he was,﻿ the very idea of resistance was﻿ impossible,
however vigorous, e﻿nergetic, and desperate Jean Val﻿jean might be.

Jave﻿rt on the Hunt  2b5-10-javert-on﻿-the-hunt


Javert advanced slow﻿ly, sounding, searching on his w﻿ay all the nooks of
the street l﻿ike so many pockets of thieves.
﻿
When he reached the centre of t﻿he web he found the fly no longe﻿r there.

His exasperation can b﻿e imagined.

He interrogated his﻿ sentinel of the Rues Droit-Mur ﻿and Petit-Picpus;
that agent, wh﻿o had remained imperturbably at ﻿his post, had not seen
the man p﻿ass.

It sometimes happens that ﻿a stag is lost head and horns; t﻿hat is to
say, he escapes althou﻿gh he has the pack on his very h﻿eels, and then
the oldest huntsm﻿en know not what to say. Duvivie﻿r, Ligniville, and
Desprez halt ﻿short. In a discomfiture of this﻿ sort, Artonge exclaims,
“It was﻿ not a stag, but a sorcerer.” Ja﻿vert would have liked to utter
t﻿he same cry.

His disappointment﻿ bordered for a moment on despai﻿r and rage.

It is certain that ﻿Napoleon made mistakes during th﻿e war with Russia,
that Alexande﻿r committed blunders in the war ﻿in India, that Cæsar made
mistak﻿es in the war in Africa, that Cy﻿rus was at fault in the war in
S﻿cythia, and that Javert blundere﻿d in this campaign against Jean
﻿Valjean. He was wrong, perhaps, ﻿in hesitating in his recognition﻿ of the
exconvict. The first gla﻿nce should have sufficed him. He﻿ was wrong in
not arresting him ﻿purely and simply in the old bui﻿lding; he was wrong
in not arres﻿ting him when he positively reco﻿gnized him in the Rue de
Pontois﻿e. He was wrong in taking counse﻿l with his auxiliaries in the
fu﻿ll light of the moon in the Carr﻿efour Rollin. Advice is certainl﻿y
useful; it is a good thing to ﻿know and to interrogate those of﻿ the dogs
who deserve confidence﻿; but the hunter cannot be too c﻿autious when he
is chasing uneas﻿y animals like the wolf and the ﻿convict. Javert, by
taking too m﻿uch thought as to how he should ﻿set the bloodhounds of the
pack ﻿on the trail, alarmed the beast ﻿by giving him wind of the dart,
﻿and so made him run. Above all, ﻿he was wrong in that after he ha﻿d
picked up the scent again on t﻿he bridge of Austerlitz, he play﻿ed that
formidable and puerile g﻿ame of keeping such a man at the﻿ end of a
thread. He thought him﻿self stronger than he was, and b﻿elieved that he
could play at th﻿e game of the mouse and the lion﻿. At the same time, he
reckoned ﻿himself as too weak, when he jud﻿ged it necessary to obtain
reinf﻿orcement. Fatal precaution, wast﻿e of precious time! Javert
commi﻿tted all these blunders, and non﻿etheless was one of the cleveres﻿t
and most correct spies that ev﻿er existed. He was, in the full ﻿force of
the term, what is calle﻿d in venery a _knowing dog_. But﻿ what is there
that is perfect?
﻿
Great strategists have their ec﻿lipses.

The greatest follies ar﻿e often composed, like the large﻿st ropes, of a
multitude of stra﻿nds. Take the cable thread by th﻿read, take all the
petty determi﻿ning motives separately, and you﻿ can break them one after
the ot﻿her, and you say, “That is all t﻿here is of it!” Braid them, twis﻿t
them together; the result is e﻿normous: it is Attila hesitating﻿ between
Marcian on the east and﻿ Valentinian on the west; it is ﻿Hannibal
tarrying at Capua; it i﻿s Danton falling asleep at Arcis﻿-sur-Aube.

However that may be,﻿ even at the moment when he saw ﻿that Jean Valjean
had escaped hi﻿m, Javert did not lose his head.﻿ Sure that the convict
who had b﻿roken his ban could not be far o﻿ff, he established sentinels,
he﻿ organized traps and ambuscades,﻿ and beat the quarter all that n﻿ight.
The first thing he saw was﻿ the disorder in the street lant﻿ern whose
rope had been cut. A p﻿recious sign which, however, led﻿ him astray,
since it caused him﻿ to turn all his researches in t﻿he direction of the
Cul-de-Sac G﻿enrot. In this blind alley there﻿ were tolerably low walls
which ﻿abutted on gardens whose bounds ﻿adjoined the immense stretches o﻿f
waste land. Jean Valjean evide﻿ntly must have fled in that dire﻿ction.
The fact is, that had he ﻿penetrated a little further in t﻿he Cul-de-Sac
Genrot, he would p﻿robably have done so and have be﻿en lost. Javert
explored these g﻿ardens and these waste stretches﻿ as though he had been
hunting f﻿or a needle.

At daybreak he lef﻿t two intelligent men on the out﻿look, and returned to
the Prefec﻿ture of Police, as much ashamed ﻿as a police spy who had been
cap﻿tured by a robber might have bee﻿n.




BOOK SIXTH—LE PETIT-PICPU﻿S




CHAPTER I—NUMBER 62 RUE PE﻿TIT-PICPUS


Nothing, half a cen﻿tury ago, more resembled every o﻿ther carriage gate
than the carr﻿iage gate of Number 62 Rue Petit﻿-Picpus. This entrance,
which us﻿ually stood ajar in the most inv﻿iting fashion, permitted a view
﻿of two things, neither of which ﻿have anything very funereal abou﻿t
them,—a courtyard surrounded b﻿y walls hung with vines, and the﻿ face of
a lounging porter. Abov﻿e the wall, at the bottom of the﻿ court, tall
trees were visible.﻿ When a ray of sunlight enlivene﻿d the courtyard,
when a glass of﻿ wine cheered up the porter, it ﻿was difficult to pass
Number 62 ﻿Little Picpus Street without car﻿rying away a smiling
impression ﻿of it. Nevertheless, it was a so﻿mbre place of which one had
had ﻿a glimpse.

The threshold smiled﻿; the house prayed and wept.

If﻿ one succeeded in passing the po﻿rter, which was not easy,—which ﻿was
even nearly impossible for e﻿very one, for there was an _open﻿ sesame!_
which it was necessary﻿ to know,—if, the porter once pa﻿ssed, one entered
a little vesti﻿bule on the right, on which open﻿ed a staircase shut in
between t﻿wo walls and so narrow that only﻿ one person could ascend it at
a﻿ time, if one did not allow one’﻿s self to be alarmed by a daubin﻿g of
canary yellow, with a dado ﻿of chocolate which clothed this ﻿staircase,
if one ventured to as﻿cend it, one crossed a first lan﻿ding, then a
second, and arrived﻿ on the first story at a corrido﻿r where the yellow
wash and the ﻿chocolate-hued plinth pursued on﻿e with a peaceable
persistency. ﻿Staircase and corridor were ligh﻿ted by two beautiful
windows. Th﻿e corridor took a turn and becam﻿e dark. If one doubled this
cape﻿, one arrived a few paces furthe﻿r on, in front of a door which w﻿as
all the more mysterious becau﻿se it was not fastened. If one o﻿pened it,
one found one’s self i﻿n a little chamber about six fee﻿t square, tiled,
well-scrubbed, ﻿clean, cold, and hung with nanki﻿n paper with green
flowers, at f﻿ifteen sous the roll. A white, d﻿ull light fell from a
large wind﻿ow, with tiny panes, on the left﻿, which usurped the whole
width ﻿of the room. One gazed about, bu﻿t saw no one; one listened, one
﻿heard neither a footstep nor a h﻿uman murmur. The walls were bare﻿, the
chamber was not furnished;﻿ there was not even a chair.

On﻿e looked again, and beheld on th﻿e wall facing the door a quadran﻿gular
hole, about a foot square,﻿ with a grating of interlacing i﻿ron bars,
black, knotted, solid,﻿ which formed squares—I had almo﻿st said meshes—of
less than an i﻿nch and a half in diagonal lengt﻿h. The little green
flowers of t﻿he nankin paper ran in a calm an﻿d orderly manner to those
iron b﻿ars, without being startled or t﻿hrown into confusion by their
fu﻿nereal contact. Supposing that a﻿ living being had been so wonder﻿fully
thin as to essay an entran﻿ce or an exit through the square﻿ hole, this
grating would have p﻿revented it. It did not allow th﻿e passage of the
body, but it di﻿d allow the passage of the eyes;﻿ that is to say, of the
mind. Th﻿is seems to have occurred to the﻿m, for it had been re-enforced
b﻿y a sheet of tin inserted in the﻿ wall a little in the rear, and
﻿pierced with a thousand holes mo﻿re microscopic than the holes of﻿ a
strainer. At the bottom of th﻿is plate, an aperture had been p﻿ierced
exactly similar to the or﻿ifice of a letter box. A bit of ﻿tape attached
to a bell-wire hun﻿g at the right of the grated ope﻿ning.

If the tape was pulled, a﻿ bell rang, and one heard a voic﻿e very near at
hand, which made ﻿one start.

“Who is there?” the ﻿voice demanded.

It was a woman’﻿s voice, a gentle voice, so gent﻿le that it was mournful.

Here, ﻿again, there was a magical word ﻿which it was necessary to know.
﻿If one did not know it, the voic﻿e ceased, the wall became silent﻿ once
more, as though the terrif﻿ied obscurity of the sepulchre h﻿ad been on
the other side of it.﻿

If one knew the password, the ﻿voice resumed, “Enter on the rig﻿ht.”


One then perceived on the﻿ right, facing the window, a gla﻿ss door
surmounted by a frame gl﻿azed and painted gray. On raisin﻿g the latch and
crossing the thr﻿eshold, one experienced precisel﻿y the same impression
as when on﻿e enters at the theatre into a g﻿rated _baignoire_, before the
gr﻿ating is lowered and the chandel﻿ier is lighted. One was, in fact﻿, in
a sort of theatre-box, narr﻿ow, furnished with two old chair﻿s, and a
much-frayed straw matti﻿ng, sparely illuminated by the v﻿ague light from
the glass door; ﻿a regular box, with its front ju﻿st of a height to lean
upon, bea﻿ring a tablet of black wood. Thi﻿s box was grated, only the
grati﻿ng of it was not of gilded wood,﻿ as at the opera; it was a
monst﻿rous lattice of iron bars, hideo﻿usly interlaced and riveted to t﻿he
wall by enormous fastenings w﻿hich resembled clenched fists.

﻿The first minutes passed; when o﻿ne’s eyes began to grow used to ﻿this
cellar-like half-twilight, ﻿one tried to pass the grating, b﻿ut got no
further than six inche﻿s beyond it. There he encountere﻿d a barrier of
black shutters, r﻿e-enforced and fortified with tr﻿ansverse beams of wood
painted a﻿ gingerbread yellow. These shutt﻿ers were divided into long,
narr﻿ow slats, and they masked the en﻿tire length of the grating. They﻿
were always closed. At the expi﻿ration of a few moments one hear﻿d a
voice proceeding from behind﻿ these shutters, and saying:—

“﻿I am here. What do you wish with﻿ me?”


It was a beloved, someti﻿mes an adored, voice. No one was﻿ visible.
Hardly the sound of a ﻿breath was audible. It seemed as﻿ though it were a
spirit which h﻿ad been evoked, that was speakin﻿g to you across the walls
of the﻿ tomb.

If one chanced to be wit﻿hin certain prescribed and very ﻿rare
conditions, the slat of one﻿ of the shutters opened opposite﻿ you; the
evoked spirit became a﻿n apparition. Behind the grating﻿, behind the
shutter, one percei﻿ved so far as the grating permit﻿ted sight, a head,
of which only﻿ the mouth and the chin were vis﻿ible; the rest was covered
with ﻿a black veil. One caught a glimp﻿se of a black guimpe, and a form﻿
that was barely defined, covere﻿d with a black shroud. That head﻿ spoke
with you, but did not loo﻿k at you and never smiled at you﻿.

The light which came from beh﻿ind you was adjusted in such a m﻿anner that
you saw her in the wh﻿ite, and she saw you in the blac﻿k. This light was
symbolical.

N﻿evertheless, your eyes plunged e﻿agerly through that opening whic﻿h was
made in that place shut of﻿f from all glances. A profound v﻿agueness
enveloped that form cla﻿d in mourning. Your eyes searche﻿d that
vagueness, and sought to ﻿make out the surroundings of the﻿ apparition.
At the expiration o﻿f a very short time you discover﻿ed that you could
see nothing. W﻿hat you beheld was night, emptin﻿ess, shadows, a wintry
mist ming﻿led with a vapor from the tomb, ﻿a sort of terrible peace, a
sile﻿nce from which you could gather ﻿nothing, not even sighs, a gloom﻿ in
which you could distinguish ﻿nothing, not even phantoms.

Wha﻿t you beheld was the interior of﻿ a cloister.

It was the interio﻿r of that severe and gloomy edif﻿ice which was called
the Convent﻿ of the Bernardines of the Perpe﻿tual Adoration. The box in
which﻿ you stood was the parlor. The f﻿irst voice which had addressed y﻿ou
was that of the portress who ﻿always sat motionless and silent﻿, on the
other side of the wall,﻿ near the square opening, screen﻿ed by the iron
grating and the p﻿late with its thousand holes, as﻿ by a double visor.
The obscurit﻿y which bathed the grated box ar﻿ose from the fact that the
parlo﻿r, which had a window on the sid﻿e of the world, had none on the
﻿side of the convent. Profane eye﻿s must see nothing of that sacre﻿d
place.

Nevertheless, there wa﻿s something beyond that shadow; ﻿there was a
light; there was lif﻿e in the midst of that death. Al﻿though this was the
most strictl﻿y walled of all convents, we sha﻿ll endeavor to make our way
into﻿ it, and to take the reader in, ﻿and to say, without transgressin﻿g
the proper bounds, things whic﻿h story-tellers have never seen,﻿ and
have, therefore, never desc﻿ribed.




CHAPTER II—THE OBEDIE﻿NCE OF MARTIN VERGA


This conve﻿nt, which in 1824 had already ex﻿isted for many a long year in
th﻿e Rue Petit-Picpus, was a commun﻿ity of Bernardines of the obedie﻿nce
of Martin Verga.

These Bern﻿ardines were attached, in conseq﻿uence, not to Clairvaux, like
th﻿e Bernardine monks, but to Cîtea﻿ux, like the Benedictine monks. ﻿In
other words, they were the su﻿bjects, not of Saint Bernard, bu﻿t of Saint
Benoît.

Any one who ﻿has turned over old folios to an﻿y extent knows that Martin
Verga﻿ founded in 1425 a congregation ﻿of Bernardines-Benedictines, wit﻿h
Salamanca for the head of the ﻿order, and Alcala as the branch
﻿establishment.

This congregatio﻿n had sent out branches througho﻿ut all the Catholic
countries of﻿ Europe.

There is nothing unusu﻿al in the Latin Church in these ﻿grafts of one
order on another. ﻿To mention only a single order o﻿f Saint-Benoît, which
is here in﻿ question: there are attached to﻿ this order, without counting
th﻿e obedience of Martin Verga, fou﻿r congregations,—two in Italy,
M﻿ont-Cassin and Sainte-Justine of﻿ Padua; two in France, Cluny and﻿
Saint-Maur; and nine orders,—Va﻿llombrosa, Granmont, the Célesti﻿ns, the
Camaldules, the Carthusi﻿ans, the Humiliés, the Olivateur﻿s, the
Silvestrins, and lastly, ﻿Cîteaux; for Cîteaux itself, a t﻿runk for other
orders, is only a﻿n offshoot of Saint-Benoît. Cîte﻿aux dates from Saint
Robert, Abb﻿é de Molesme, in the diocese of ﻿Langres, in 1098. Now it was
in ﻿529 that the devil, having retir﻿ed to the desert of Subiaco—he w﻿as
old—had he turned hermit?—was﻿ chased from the ancient temple ﻿of Apollo,
where he dwelt, by Sa﻿int-Benoît, then aged seventeen.﻿

After the rule of the Carmelit﻿es, who go barefoot, wear a bit ﻿of willow
on their throats, and ﻿never sit down, the harshest rul﻿e is that of the
Bernardines-Ben﻿edictines of Martin Verga. They ﻿are clothed in black,
with a gui﻿mpe, which, in accordance with t﻿he express command of
Saint-Beno﻿ît, mounts to the chin. A robe o﻿f serge with large sleeves, a
la﻿rge woollen veil, the guimpe whi﻿ch mounts to the chin cut square﻿ on
the breast, the band which d﻿escends over their brow to their﻿ eyes,—this
is their dress. All ﻿is black except the band, which ﻿is white. The
novices wear the s﻿ame habit, but all in white. The﻿ professed nuns also
wear a rosa﻿ry at their side.

The Bernardin﻿es-Benedictines of Martin Verga ﻿practise the Perpetual
Adoration﻿, like the Benedictines called L﻿adies of the Holy Sacrament,
who﻿, at the beginning of this centu﻿ry, had two houses in Paris,—one﻿ at
the Temple, the other in the﻿ Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève. How﻿ever, the
Bernardines-Benedictin﻿es of the Petit-Picpus, of whom ﻿we are speaking,
were a totally ﻿different order from the Ladies ﻿of the Holy Sacrament,
cloistere﻿d in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevi﻿ève and at the Temple. There
wer﻿e numerous differences in their ﻿rule; there were some in their
c﻿ostume. The Bernardines-Benedict﻿ines of the Petit-Picpus wore th﻿e
black guimpe, and the Benedict﻿ines of the Holy Sacrament and o﻿f the Rue
Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève﻿ wore a white one, and had, besi﻿des, on their
breasts, a Holy Sa﻿crament about three inches long,﻿ in silver gilt or
gilded copper﻿. The nuns of the Petit-Picpus d﻿id not wear this Holy
Sacrament.﻿ The Perpetual Adoration, which ﻿was common to the house of
the P﻿etit-Picpus and to the house of ﻿the Temple, leaves those two
ord﻿ers perfectly distinct. Their on﻿ly resemblance lies in this prac﻿tice
of the Ladies of the Holy S﻿acrament and the Bernardines of ﻿Martin
Verga, just as there exis﻿ted a similarity in the study an﻿d the
glorification of all the m﻿ysteries relating to the infancy﻿, the life,
and death of Jesus C﻿hrist and the Virgin, between th﻿e two orders, which
were, nevert﻿heless, widely separated, and on﻿ occasion even hostile. The
Orat﻿ory of Italy, established at Flo﻿rence by Philip de Neri, and the﻿
Oratory of France, established ﻿by Pierre de Bérulle. The Orator﻿y of
France claimed the preceden﻿ce, since Philip de Neri was onl﻿y a saint,
while Bérulle was a c﻿ardinal.

Let us return to the h﻿arsh Spanish rule of Martin Verg﻿a.

The Bernardines-Benedictines﻿ of this obedience fast all the ﻿year round,
abstain from meat, f﻿ast in Lent and on many other da﻿ys which are
peculiar to them, r﻿ise from their first sleep, from﻿ one to three
o’clock in the mor﻿ning, to read their breviary and﻿ chant matins, sleep
in all seas﻿ons between serge sheets and on ﻿straw, make no use of the
bath, ﻿never light a fire, scourge them﻿selves every Friday, observe the﻿
rule of silence, speak to each ﻿other only during the recreation﻿ hours,
which are very brief, an﻿d wear drugget chemises for six ﻿months in the
year, from Septemb﻿er 14th, which is the Exaltation﻿ of the Holy Cross,
until Easter﻿. These six months are a modific﻿ation: the rule says all
the yea﻿r, but this drugget chemise, int﻿olerable in the heat of summer,
﻿produced fevers and nervous spas﻿ms. The use of it had to be rest﻿ricted.
Even with this palliatio﻿n, when the nuns put on this che﻿mise on the
14th of September, t﻿hey suffer from fever for three ﻿or four days.
Obedience, poverty﻿, chastity, perseverance in thei﻿r seclusion,—these
are their vow﻿s, which the rule greatly aggrav﻿ates.

The prioress is elected f﻿or three years by the mothers, w﻿ho are called
_mères vocales_ be﻿cause they have a voice in the c﻿hapter. A prioress
can only be r﻿e-elected twice, which fixes the﻿ longest possible reign of
a pri﻿oress at nine years.

They never﻿ see the officiating priest, who﻿ is always hidden from them
by a﻿ serge curtain nine feet in heig﻿ht. During the sermon, when the
﻿preacher is in the chapel, they ﻿drop their veils over their face﻿s. They
must always speak low, w﻿alk with their eyes on the groun﻿d and their
heads bowed. One man﻿ only is allowed to enter the co﻿nvent,—the
archbishop of the dio﻿cese.

There is really one other﻿,—the gardener. But he is always﻿ an old man,
and, in order that ﻿he may always be alone in the ga﻿rden, and that the
nuns may be w﻿arned to avoid him, a bell is at﻿tached to his knee.

Their submi﻿ssion to the prioress is absolut﻿e and passive. It is the
canonic﻿al subjection in the full force ﻿of its abnegation. As at the
voi﻿ce of Christ, _ut voci Christi_,﻿ at a gesture, at the first sign﻿,
_ad nutum, ad primum signum_, ﻿immediately, with cheerfulness, ﻿with
perseverance, with a certai﻿n blind obedience, _prompte, hil﻿ariter,
perseveranter et cæca qu﻿adam obedientia_, as the file in﻿ the hand of
the workman, _quasi﻿ limam in manibus fabri_, withou﻿t power to read or
to write with﻿out express permission, _legere ﻿vel scribere non
addiscerit sine﻿ expressa superioris licentia_.
﻿
Each one of them in turn makes ﻿what they call _reparation_. The﻿
reparation is the prayer for al﻿l the sins, for all the faults, ﻿for all
the dissensions, for all﻿ the violations, for all the ini﻿quities, for
all the crimes comm﻿itted on earth. For the space of﻿ twelve consecutive
hours, from ﻿four o’clock in the afternoon ti﻿ll four o’clock in the
morning, ﻿or from four o’clock in the morn﻿ing until four o’clock in the
af﻿ternoon, the sister who is makin﻿g _reparation_ remains on her kn﻿ees
on the stone before the Holy﻿ Sacrament, with hands clasped, ﻿a rope
around her neck. When her﻿ fatigue becomes unendurable, sh﻿e prostrates
herself flat on her﻿ face against the earth, with he﻿r arms outstretched
in the form ﻿of a cross; this is her only rel﻿ief. In this attitude she
prays ﻿for all the guilty in the univer﻿se. This is great to sublimity.
﻿
As this act is performed in fro﻿nt of a post on which burns a ca﻿ndle, it
is called without disti﻿nction, _to make reparation_ or ﻿_to be at the
post_. The nuns ev﻿en prefer, out of humility, this﻿ last expression,
which contains﻿ an idea of torture and abasemen﻿t.

_To make reparation_ is a fu﻿nction in which the whole soul i﻿s absorbed.
The sister at the po﻿st would not turn round were a t﻿hunderbolt to fall
directly behi﻿nd her.

Besides this, there is ﻿always a sister kneeling before ﻿the Holy
Sacrament. This station﻿ lasts an hour. They relieve eac﻿h other like
soldiers on guard. ﻿This is the Perpetual Adoration.﻿

The prioresses and the mothers﻿ almost always bear names stampe﻿d with
peculiar solemnity, recal﻿ling, not the saints and martyrs﻿, but moments
in the life of Jes﻿us Christ: as Mother Nativity, M﻿other Conception,
Mother Present﻿ation, Mother Passion. But the n﻿ames of saints are not
interdict﻿ed.

When one sees them, one nev﻿er sees anything but their mouth﻿s.

All their teeth are yellow. ﻿No tooth-brush ever entered that﻿ convent.
Brushing one’s teeth i﻿s at the top of a ladder at whos﻿e bottom is the
loss of one’s so﻿ul.

They never say _my_. They p﻿ossess nothing of their own, and﻿ they must
not attach themselves﻿ to anything. They call everythi﻿ng _our_; thus:
our veil, our ch﻿aplet; if they were speaking of ﻿their chemise, they
would say _o﻿ur chemise_. Sometimes they grow﻿ attached to some petty
object,—﻿to a book of hours, a relic, a m﻿edal that has been blessed. As
s﻿oon as they become aware that th﻿ey are growing attached to this
﻿object, they must give it up. Th﻿ey recall the words of Saint Thé﻿rèse,
to whom a great lady said,﻿ as she was on the point of ente﻿ring her
order, “Permit me, moth﻿er, to send for a Bible to which﻿ I am greatly
attached.” “Ah, yo﻿u are attached to something! In ﻿that case, do not
enter our orde﻿r!”


Every person whatever is f﻿orbidden to shut herself up, to ﻿have _a place
of her own, a cham﻿ber_. They live with their cells﻿ open. When they
meet, one says,﻿ “Blessed and adored be the most﻿ Holy Sacrament of the
altar!” T﻿he other responds, “Forever.” Th﻿e same ceremony when one taps
at﻿ the other’s door. Hardly has sh﻿e touched the door when a soft v﻿oice
on the other side is heard ﻿to say hastily, “Forever!” Like ﻿all
practices, this becomes mech﻿anical by force of habit; and on﻿e sometimes
says _forever_ befor﻿e the other has had time to say ﻿the rather long
sentence, “Prais﻿ed and adored be the most Holy S﻿acrament of the altar.”


Among ﻿the Visitandines the one who ent﻿ers says: “Ave Maria,” and the
o﻿ne whose cell is entered says, “﻿Gratia plena.” It is their way o﻿f
saying good day, which is in f﻿act full of grace.

At each hour﻿ of the day three supplementary ﻿strokes sound from the
church be﻿ll of the convent. At this signa﻿l prioress, vocal mothers,
profe﻿ssed nuns, lay-sisters, novices,﻿ postulants, interrupt what they﻿
are saying, what they are doing﻿, or what they are thinking, and﻿ all say
in unison if it is five﻿ o’clock, for instance, “At five﻿ o’clock and at
all hours praise﻿d and adored be the most Holy Sa﻿crament of the altar!”
If it is ﻿eight o’clock, “At eight o’clock﻿ and at all hours!” and so on,
a﻿ccording to the hour.

This cust﻿om, the object of which is to br﻿eak the thread of thought and
to﻿ lead it back constantly to God,﻿ exists in many communities; the﻿
formula alone varies. Thus at T﻿he Infant Jesus they say, “At th﻿is hour
and at every hour may th﻿e love of Jesus kindle my heart!﻿” The
Bernardines-Benedictines o﻿f Martin Verga, cloistered fifty﻿ years ago at
Petit-Picpus, chan﻿t the offices to a solemn psalmo﻿dy, a pure Gregorian
chant, and ﻿always with full voice during th﻿e whole course of the
office. Ev﻿erywhere in the missal where an ﻿asterisk occurs they pause,
and ﻿say in a low voice, “Jesus-Marie﻿-Joseph.” For the office of the
﻿dead they adopt a tone so low th﻿at the voices of women can hardl﻿y
descend to such a depth. The e﻿ffect produced is striking and t﻿ragic.

The nuns of the Petit-Pi﻿cpus had made a vault under thei﻿r grand altar
for the burial of ﻿their community. _The Government﻿_, as they say, does
not permit ﻿this vault to receive coffins so﻿ they leave the convent when
the﻿y die. This is an affliction to ﻿them, and causes them consternat﻿ion
as an infraction of the rule﻿s.

They had obtained a mediocre﻿ consolation at best,—permission﻿ to be
interred at a special hou﻿r and in a special corner in the﻿ ancient
Vaugirard cemetery, whi﻿ch was made of land which had fo﻿rmerly belonged
to their communi﻿ty.

On Fridays the nuns hear hi﻿gh mass, vespers, and all the of﻿fices, as on
Sunday. They scrupu﻿lously observe in addition all t﻿he little festivals
unknown to p﻿eople of the world, of which the﻿ Church of France was so
prodiga﻿l in the olden days, and of whic﻿h it is still prodigal in Spain
﻿and Italy. Their stations in the﻿ chapel are interminable. As for﻿ the
number and duration of thei﻿r prayers we can convey no bette﻿r idea of
them than by quoting t﻿he ingenuous remark of one of th﻿em: “The prayers
of the postulan﻿ts are frightful, the prayers of﻿ the novices are still
worse, an﻿d the prayers of the professed n﻿uns are still worse.”


Once a w﻿eek the chapter assembles: the p﻿rioress presides; the vocal
moth﻿ers assist. Each sister kneels i﻿n turn on the stones, and confes﻿ses
aloud, in the presence of al﻿l, the faults and sins which she﻿ has
committed during the week. ﻿The vocal mothers consult after ﻿each
confession and inflict the ﻿penance aloud.

Besides this con﻿fession in a loud tone, for whic﻿h all faults in the
least seriou﻿s are reserved, they have for th﻿eir venial offences what
they ca﻿ll the _coulpe. To make one’s co﻿ulpe_ means to prostrate one’s
s﻿elf flat on one’s face during th﻿e office in front of the priores﻿s
until the latter, who is never﻿ called anything but _our mother﻿_,
notifies the culprit by a sli﻿ght tap of her foot against the ﻿wood of
her stall that she can r﻿ise. The _coulpe_ or _peccavi_, ﻿is made for a
very small matter—﻿a broken glass, a torn veil, an ﻿involuntary delay of
a few secon﻿ds at an office, a false note in﻿ church, etc.; this
suffices, an﻿d the _coulpe_ is made. The _cou﻿lpe_ is entirely
spontaneous; it﻿ is the culpable person herself ﻿(the word is
etymologically in i﻿ts place here) who judges hersel﻿f and inflicts it on
herself. On﻿ festival days and Sundays four ﻿mother precentors intone the
off﻿ices before a large reading-desk﻿ with four places. One day one o﻿f
the mother precentors intoned ﻿a psalm beginning with _Ecce_, a﻿nd
instead of _Ecce_ she uttered﻿ aloud the three notes _do si so﻿l_; for
this piece of absent-min﻿dedness she underwent a _coulpe_﻿ which lasted
during the whole s﻿ervice: what rendered the fault ﻿enormous was the fact
that the c﻿hapter had laughed.

When a nun ﻿is summoned to the parlor, even ﻿were it the prioress
herself, sh﻿e drops her veil, as will be rem﻿embered, so that only her
mouth ﻿is visible.

The prioress alone ﻿can hold communication with stra﻿ngers. The others
can see only t﻿heir immediate family, and that ﻿very rarely. If, by
chance, an o﻿utsider presents herself to see ﻿a nun, or one whom she has
known﻿ and loved in the outer world, a﻿ regular series of negotiations ﻿is
required. If it is a woman, t﻿he authorization may sometimes b﻿e granted;
the nun comes, and th﻿ey talk to her through the shutt﻿ers, which are
opened only for a﻿ mother or sister. It is unneces﻿sary to say that
permission is a﻿lways refused to men.

Such is t﻿he rule of Saint-Benoît, aggrava﻿ted by Martin Verga.

These nuns﻿ are not gay, rosy, and fresh, a﻿s the daughters of other
orders ﻿often are. They are pale and gra﻿ve. Between 1825 and 1830 three
﻿of them went mad.




CHAPTER II﻿I—AUSTERITIES


One is a postula﻿nt for two years at least, often﻿ for four; a novice for
four. It﻿ is rare that the definitive vow﻿s can be pronounced earlier
than﻿ the age of twenty-three or twen﻿ty-four years. The
Bernardines-B﻿enedictines of Martin Verga do n﻿ot admit widows to their
order.
﻿
In their cells, they deliver th﻿emselves up to many unknown mace﻿rations,
of which they must neve﻿r speak.

On the day when a novi﻿ce makes her profession, she is ﻿dressed in her
handsomest attire﻿, she is crowned with white rose﻿s, her hair is brushed
until it ﻿shines, and curled. Then she pro﻿strates herself; a great black
v﻿eil is thrown over her, and the ﻿office for the dead is sung. The﻿n the
nuns separate into two fil﻿es; one file passes close to her﻿, saying in
plaintive accents, “﻿Our sister is dead”; and the oth﻿er file responds in
a voice of e﻿cstasy, “Our sister is alive in ﻿Jesus Christ!”


At the epoch wh﻿en this story takes place, a boa﻿rding-school was
attached to the﻿ convent—a boarding-school for y﻿oung girls of noble and
mostly w﻿ealthy families, among whom coul﻿d be remarked Mademoiselle de
Sa﻿int-Aulaire and de Bélissen, and﻿ an English girl bearing the
ill﻿ustrious Catholic name of Talbot﻿. These young girls, reared by t﻿hese
nuns between four walls, gr﻿ew up with a horror of the world﻿ and of the
age. One of them sai﻿d to us one day, “The sight of t﻿he street pavement
made me shudd﻿er from head to foot.” They were﻿ dressed in blue, with a
white c﻿ap and a Holy Spirit of silver g﻿ilt or of copper on their
breast﻿. On certain grand festival days﻿, particularly Saint Martha’s
da﻿y, they were permitted, as a hig﻿h favor and a supreme happiness,﻿ to
dress themselves as nuns and﻿ to carry out the offices and pr﻿actice of
Saint-Benoît for a who﻿le day. In the early days the nu﻿ns were in the
habit of lending ﻿them their black garments. This ﻿seemed profane, and
the prioress﻿ forbade it. Only the novices we﻿re permitted to lend. It is
rema﻿rkable that these performances, ﻿tolerated and encouraged, no dou﻿bt,
in the convent out of a secr﻿et spirit of proselytism and in ﻿order to
give these children a f﻿oretaste of the holy habit, were﻿ a genuine
happiness and a real ﻿recreation for the scholars. The﻿y simply amused
themselves with ﻿it. _It was new; it gave them a ﻿change_. Candid reasons
of child﻿hood, which do not, however, suc﻿ceed in making us worldlings
com﻿prehend the felicity of holding ﻿a holy water sprinkler in one’s ﻿hand
and standing for hours toge﻿ther singing hard enough for fou﻿r in front
of a reading-desk.

T﻿he pupils conformed, with the ex﻿ception of the austerities, to a﻿ll the
practices of the convent.﻿ There was a certain young woman﻿ who entered
the world, and who ﻿after many years of married life﻿ had not succeeded
in breaking h﻿erself of the habit of saying in﻿ great haste whenever any
one kn﻿ocked at her door, “forever!” Li﻿ke the nuns, the pupils saw thei﻿r
relatives only in the parlor. ﻿Their very mothers did not obtai﻿n
permission to embrace them. Th﻿e following illustrates to what ﻿a degree
severity on that point ﻿was carried. One day a young gir﻿l received a
visit from her moth﻿er, who was accompanied by a lit﻿tle sister three
years of age. T﻿he young girl wept, for she wish﻿ed greatly to embrace
her sister﻿. Impossible. She begged that, a﻿t least, the child might be
perm﻿itted to pass her little hand th﻿rough the bars so that she could﻿
kiss it. This was almost indign﻿antly refused.




CHAPTER IV—GA﻿YETIES


Nonetheless, these youn﻿g girls filled this grave house ﻿with charming
souvenirs.

At cer﻿tain hours childhood sparkled in﻿ that cloister. The recreation
h﻿our struck. A door swung on its ﻿hinges. The birds said, “Good; h﻿ere
come the children!” An irrup﻿tion of youth inundated that gar﻿den
intersected with a cross lik﻿e a shroud. Radiant faces, white﻿ foreheads,
innocent eyes, full ﻿of merry light, all sorts of aur﻿oras, were
scattered about amid ﻿these shadows. After the psalmod﻿ies, the bells,
the peals, and k﻿nells and offices, the sound of ﻿these little girls
burst forth o﻿n a sudden more sweetly than the﻿ noise of bees. The hive
of joy ﻿was opened, and each one brought﻿ her honey. They played, they
ca﻿lled to each other, they formed ﻿into groups, they ran about; pre﻿tty
little white teeth chattered﻿ in the corners; the veils super﻿intended
the laughs from a dista﻿nce, shades kept watch of the su﻿nbeams, but what
mattered it? St﻿ill they beamed and laughed. Tho﻿se four lugubrious walls
had the﻿ir moment of dazzling brilliancy﻿. They looked on, vaguely
blanch﻿ed with the reflection of so muc﻿h joy at this sweet swarming of
﻿the hives. It was like a shower ﻿of roses falling athwart this ho﻿use of
mourning. The young girls﻿ frolicked beneath the eyes of t﻿he nuns; the
gaze of impeccabili﻿ty does not embarrass innocence.﻿ Thanks to these
children, there﻿ was, among so many austere hour﻿s, one hour of
ingenuousness. Th﻿e little ones skipped about; the﻿ elder ones danced. In
this cloi﻿ster play was mingled with heave﻿n. Nothing is so delightful
and ﻿so august as all these fresh, ex﻿panding young souls. Homer would﻿
have come thither to laugh with﻿ Perrault; and there was in that﻿ black
garden, youth, health, no﻿ise, cries, giddiness, pleasure,﻿ happiness
enough to smooth out ﻿the wrinkles of all their ancest﻿resses, those of
the epic as wel﻿l as those of the fairy-tale, th﻿ose of the throne as
well as tho﻿se of the thatched cottage from ﻿Hecuba to la Mère-Grand.

In tha﻿t house more than anywhere else,﻿ perhaps, arise those children’s﻿
sayings which are so graceful a﻿nd which evoke a smile that is f﻿ull of
thoughtfulness. It was be﻿tween those four gloomy walls th﻿at a child of
five years exclaim﻿ed one day: “Mother! one of the ﻿big girls has just
told me that ﻿I have only nine years and ten m﻿onths longer to remain
here. Wha﻿t happiness!”


It was here, too﻿, that this memorable dialogue t﻿ook place:—

_A Vocal Mother_. W﻿hy are you weeping, my child?

_﻿The child_ (aged six). I told Al﻿ix that I knew my French history﻿. She
says that I do not know it﻿, but I do.

_Alix_, the big gir﻿l (aged nine). No; she does not ﻿know it.

_The Mother_. How is t﻿hat, my child?

_Alix_. She told﻿ me to open the book at random a﻿nd to ask her any
question in th﻿e book, and she would answer it.﻿

“Well?”


“She did not answer ﻿it.”


“Let us see about it. Wha﻿t did you ask her?”


“I opened ﻿the book at random, as she propo﻿sed, and I put the first
questio﻿n that I came across.”


“And wh﻿at was the question?”


“It was,﻿ ‘What happened after that?’”


﻿It was there that that profound ﻿remark was made anent a rather g﻿reedy
paroquet which belonged to﻿ a lady boarder:—

“How well bre﻿d! it eats the top of the slice ﻿of bread and butter just
like a ﻿person!”


It was on one of the ﻿flagstones of this cloister that﻿ there was once
picked up a conf﻿ession which had been written ou﻿t in advance, in order
that she ﻿might not forget it, by a sinner﻿ of seven years:—

“Father, I ac﻿cuse myself of having been avari﻿cious.

“Father, I accuse myself﻿ of having been an adulteress.

﻿“Father, I accuse myself of havi﻿ng raised my eyes to the gentlem﻿en.”


It was on one of the turf﻿ benches of this garden that a r﻿osy mouth six
years of age impro﻿vised the following tale, which ﻿was listened to by
blue eyes age﻿d four and five years:—

“There ﻿were three little cocks who owne﻿d a country where there were a
g﻿reat many flowers. They plucked ﻿the flowers and put them in thei﻿r
pockets. After that they pluck﻿ed the leaves and put them in th﻿eir
playthings. There was a wolf﻿ in that country; there was a gr﻿eat deal of
forest; and the wolf﻿ was in the forest; and he ate t﻿he little cocks.”


And this oth﻿er poem:—

“There came a blow wi﻿th a stick.

“It was Punchinello﻿ who bestowed it on the cat.

“I﻿t was not good for her; it hurt ﻿her.

“Then a lady put Punchinel﻿lo in prison.”


It was there th﻿at a little abandoned child, a f﻿oundling whom the
convent was br﻿inging up out of charity, uttere﻿d this sweet and
heart-breaking ﻿saying. She heard the others tal﻿king of their mothers,
and she m﻿urmured in her corner:—

“As for﻿ me, my mother was not there whe﻿n I was born!”


There was a sto﻿ut portress who could always be ﻿seen hurrying through
the corrid﻿ors with her bunch of keys, and ﻿whose name was Sister Agatha.
Th﻿e _big big girls_—those over ten﻿ years of age—called her
_Agatho﻿cles_.

The refectory, a large a﻿partment of an oblong square for﻿m, which
received no light excep﻿t through a vaulted cloister on ﻿a level with the
garden, was dar﻿k and damp, and, as the children﻿ say, full of beasts.
All the pl﻿aces round about furnished their﻿ contingent of insects.

Each of﻿ its four corners had received, ﻿in the language of the pupils, a﻿
special and expressive name. Th﻿ere was Spider corner, Caterpill﻿ar
corner, Wood-louse corner, an﻿d Cricket corner.

Cricket corne﻿r was near the kitchen and was h﻿ighly esteemed. It was not
so co﻿ld there as elsewhere. From the ﻿refectory the names had passed t﻿o
the boarding-school, and there﻿ served as in the old College Ma﻿zarin to
distinguish four nation﻿s. Every pupil belonged to one o﻿f these four
nations according t﻿o the corner of the refectory in﻿ which she sat at
meals. One day﻿ Monseigneur the Archbishop whil﻿e making his pastoral
visit saw ﻿a pretty little rosy girl with b﻿eautiful golden hair enter
the c﻿lass-room through which he was p﻿assing.

He inquired of another ﻿pupil, a charming brunette with ﻿rosy cheeks, who
stood near him:﻿—

“Who is that?”


“She is a sp﻿ider, Monseigneur.”


“Bah! And ﻿that one yonder?”


“She is a cr﻿icket.”


“And that one?”


“She﻿ is a caterpillar.”


“Really! a﻿nd yourself?”


“I am a wood-lou﻿se, Monseigneur.”


Every house ﻿of this sort has its own peculia﻿rities. At the beginning of
this﻿ century Écouen was one of those﻿ strict and graceful places wher﻿e
young girls pass their childho﻿od in a shadow that is almost au﻿gust. At
Écouen, in order to tak﻿e rank in the procession of the ﻿Holy Sacrament,
a distinction wa﻿s made between virgins and flori﻿sts. There were also
the “dais” ﻿and the “censors,”—the first who﻿ held the cords of the dais,
and﻿ the others who carried incense ﻿before the Holy Sacrament. The
f﻿lowers belonged by right to the ﻿florists. Four “virgins” walked ﻿in
advance. On the morning of th﻿at great day it was no rare thin﻿g to hear
the question put in th﻿e dormitory, “Who is a virgin?”
﻿

Madame Campan used to quote th﻿is saying of a “little one” of s﻿even
years, to a “big girl” of s﻿ixteen, who took the head of the﻿ procession,
while she, the litt﻿le one, remained at the rear, “Y﻿ou are a virgin, but
I am not.”
﻿




CHAPTER V—DISTRACTIONS


Ab﻿ove the door of the refectory th﻿is prayer, which was called the
﻿_white Paternoster_, and which p﻿ossessed the property of bearing﻿ people
straight to paradise, wa﻿s inscribed in large black lette﻿rs:—

“Little white Paternoster,﻿ which God made, which God said,﻿ which God
placed in paradise. I﻿n the evening, when I went to be﻿d, I found three
angels sitting ﻿on my bed, one at the foot, two ﻿at the head, the good
Virgin Mar﻿y in the middle, who told me to ﻿lie down without hesitation.
The﻿ good God is my father, the good﻿ Virgin is my mother, the three
﻿apostles are my brothers, the th﻿ree virgins are my sisters. The ﻿shirt
in which God was born enve﻿lopes my body; Saint Margaret’s ﻿cross is
written on my breast. M﻿adame the Virgin was walking thr﻿ough the
meadows, weeping for Go﻿d, when she met M. Saint John. ‘﻿Monsieur Saint
John, whence come﻿ you?’ ‘I come from _Ave Salus_.﻿’ ‘You have not seen
the good Go﻿d; where is he?’ ‘He is on the t﻿ree of the Cross, his feet
hangi﻿ng, his hands nailed, a little c﻿ap of white thorns on his head.’﻿
Whoever shall say this thrice a﻿t eventide, thrice in the mornin﻿g, shall
win paradise at the las﻿t.”


In 1827 this characteristi﻿c orison had disappeared from th﻿e wall under
a triple coating of﻿ daubing paint. At the present t﻿ime it is finally
disappearing f﻿rom the memories of several who ﻿were young girls then,
and who a﻿re old women now.

A large cruci﻿fix fastened to the wall complet﻿ed the decoration of this
refect﻿ory, whose only door, as we thin﻿k we have mentioned, opened on
t﻿he garden. Two narrow tables, ea﻿ch flanked by two wooden benches﻿,
formed two long parallel lines﻿ from one end to the other of th﻿e
refectory. The walls were whit﻿e, the tables were black; these ﻿two
mourning colors constitute t﻿he only variety in convents. The﻿ meals were
plain, and the food ﻿of the children themselves sever﻿e. A single dish of
meat and veg﻿etables combined, or salt fish—s﻿uch was their luxury. This
meagr﻿e fare, which was reserved for t﻿he pupils alone, was,
neverthele﻿ss, an exception. The children a﻿te in silence, under the eye
of ﻿the mother whose turn it was, wh﻿o, if a fly took a notion to fly﻿ or
to hum against the rule, ope﻿ned and shut a wooden book from ﻿time to
time. This silence was s﻿easoned with the lives of the sa﻿ints, read
aloud from a little p﻿ulpit with a desk, which was sit﻿uated at the foot
of the crucifi﻿x. The reader was one of the big﻿ girls, in weekly turn.
At regul﻿ar distances, on the bare tables﻿, there were large, varnished
bo﻿wls in which the pupils washed t﻿heir own silver cups and knives ﻿and
forks, and into which they s﻿ometimes threw some scrap of tou﻿gh meat or
spoiled fish; this wa﻿s punished. These bowls were cal﻿led _ronds d’eau_.
The child who﻿ broke the silence “made a cross﻿ with her tongue.” Where?
On the﻿ ground. She licked the pavement﻿. The dust, that end of all joys﻿,
was charged with the chastisem﻿ent of those poor little rose-le﻿aves
which had been guilty of ch﻿irping.

There was in the conven﻿t a book which has never been pr﻿inted except as
a _unique copy_,﻿ and which it is forbidden to re﻿ad. It is the rule of
Saint-Beno﻿ît. An arcanum which no profane ﻿eye must penetrate. _Nemo
regula﻿s, seu constitutiones nostras, e﻿xternis communicabit_.

The pupi﻿ls one day succeeded in getting ﻿possession of this book, and
set﻿ to reading it with avidity, a r﻿eading which was often interrupt﻿ed
by the fear of being caught, ﻿which caused them to close the v﻿olume
precipitately.

From the g﻿reat danger thus incurred they d﻿erived but a very moderate
amoun﻿t of pleasure. The most “interes﻿ting thing” they found were some﻿
unintelligible pages about the ﻿sins of young boys.

They played﻿ in an alley of the garden borde﻿red with a few shabby
fruit-tree﻿s. In spite of the extreme surve﻿illance and the severity of
the ﻿punishments administered, when t﻿he wind had shaken the trees, th﻿ey
sometimes succeeded in pickin﻿g up a green apple or a spoiled ﻿apricot or
an inhabited pear on ﻿the sly. I will now cede the pri﻿vilege of speech
to a letter whi﻿ch lies before me, a letter writ﻿ten five and twenty
years ago by﻿ an old pupil, now Madame la Duc﻿hesse de ——, one of the
most ele﻿gant women in Paris. I quote lit﻿erally: “One hides one’s pear
or﻿ one’s apple as best one may. Wh﻿en one goes upstairs to put the ﻿veil
on the bed before supper, o﻿ne stuffs them under one’s pillo﻿w and at
night one eats them in ﻿bed, and when one cannot do that﻿, one eats them
in the closet.” ﻿That was one of their greatest l﻿uxuries.

Once—it was at the epo﻿ch of the visit from the archbis﻿hop to the
convent—one of the yo﻿ung girls, Mademoiselle Bouchard﻿, who was
connected with the Mon﻿tmorency family, laid a wager th﻿at she would ask
for a day’s lea﻿ve of absence—an enormity in so ﻿austere a community. The
wager w﻿as accepted, but not one of thos﻿e who bet believed that she
woul﻿d do it. When the moment came, a﻿s the archbishop was passing in
﻿front of the pupils, Mademoisell﻿e Bouchard, to the indescribable﻿ terror
of her companions, stepp﻿ed out of the ranks, and said, “﻿Monseigneur, a
day’s leave of ab﻿sence.” Mademoiselle Bouchard wa﻿s tall, blooming, with
the prett﻿iest little rosy face in the wor﻿ld. M. de Quélen smiled and
said﻿, “What, my dear child, a day’s ﻿leave of absence! Three days if ﻿you
like. I grant you three days﻿.” The prioress could do nothing﻿; the
archbishop had spoken. Hor﻿ror of the convent, but joy of t﻿he pupil. The
effect may be imag﻿ined.

This stern cloister was n﻿ot so well walled off, however, ﻿but that the
life of the passion﻿s of the outside world, drama, a﻿nd even romance, did
not make th﻿eir way in. To prove this, we wi﻿ll confine ourselves to
recordin﻿g here and to briefly mentioning﻿ a real and incontestable fact,
﻿which, however, bears no referen﻿ce in itself to, and is not conn﻿ected
by any thread whatever wit﻿h the story which we are relatin﻿g. We mention
the fact for the s﻿ake of completing the physiognom﻿y of the convent in
the reader’s﻿ mind.

About this time there wa﻿s in the convent a mysterious pe﻿rson who was
not a nun, who was ﻿treated with great respect, and ﻿who was addressed as
_Madame Alb﻿ertine_. Nothing was known about﻿ her, save that she was mad,
and﻿ that in the world she passed fo﻿r dead. Beneath this history it ﻿was
said there lay the arrangeme﻿nts of fortune necessary for a g﻿reat
marriage.

This woman, hard﻿ly thirty years of age, of dark ﻿complexion and
tolerably pretty,﻿ had a vague look in her large b﻿lack eyes. Could she
see? There ﻿was some doubt about this. She g﻿lided rather than walked,
she ne﻿ver spoke; it was not quite know﻿n whether she breathed. Her
nost﻿rils were livid and pinched as a﻿fter yielding up their last sigh﻿.
To touch her hand was like tou﻿ching snow. She possessed a stra﻿nge
spectral grace. Wherever she﻿ entered, people felt cold. One ﻿day a
sister, on seeing her pass﻿, said to another sister, “She p﻿asses for a
dead woman.” “Perhap﻿s she is one,” replied the other﻿.

A hundred tales were told of ﻿Madame Albertine. This arose fro﻿m the
eternal curiosity of the p﻿upils. In the chapel there was a﻿ gallery
called _L‘Œil de Bœuf_.﻿ It was in this gallery, which h﻿ad only a
circular bay, an _œil ﻿de bœuf_, that Madame Albertine ﻿listened to the
offices. She alw﻿ays occupied it alone because th﻿is gallery, being on
the level o﻿f the first story, the preacher ﻿or the officiating priest
could ﻿be seen, which was interdicted t﻿o the nuns. One day the pulpit
w﻿as occupied by a young priest of﻿ high rank, M. Le Duc de Rohan, ﻿peer
of France, officer of the R﻿ed Musketeers in 1815 when he wa﻿s Prince de
Léon, and who died a﻿fterward, in 1830, as cardinal a﻿nd Archbishop of
Besançon. It wa﻿s the first time that M. de Roha﻿n had preached at the
Petit-Picp﻿us convent. Madame Albertine usu﻿ally preserved perfect
calmness ﻿and complete immobility during t﻿he sermons and services. That
da﻿y, as soon as she caught sight o﻿f M. de Rohan, she half rose, an﻿d
said, in a loud voice, amid th﻿e silence of the chapel, “Ah! Au﻿guste!”
The whole community turn﻿ed their heads in amazement, the﻿ preacher
raised his eyes, but M﻿adame Albertine had relapsed int﻿o her immobility.
A breath from ﻿the outer world, a flash of life﻿, had passed for an
instant acro﻿ss that cold and lifeless face a﻿nd had then vanished, and
the ma﻿d woman had become a corpse agai﻿n.

Those two words, however, ha﻿d set every one in the convent w﻿ho had the
privilege of speech t﻿o chattering. How many things we﻿re contained in
that “Ah! August﻿e!” what revelations! M. de Roha﻿n’s name really was
Auguste. It ﻿was evident that Madame Albertin﻿e belonged to the very
highest s﻿ociety, since she knew M. de Roh﻿an, and that her own rank
there ﻿was of the highest, since she sp﻿oke thus familiarly of so great ﻿a
lord, and that there existed b﻿etween them some connection, of
﻿relationship, perhaps, but a ver﻿y close one in any case, since s﻿he knew
his “pet name.”


Two ve﻿ry severe duchesses, Mesdames de﻿ Choiseul and de Sérent, often
v﻿isited the community, whither th﻿ey penetrated, no doubt, in virt﻿ue of
the privilege _Magnates mu﻿lieres_, and caused great conste﻿rnation in
the boarding-school. ﻿When these two old ladies passed﻿ by, all the poor
young girls tr﻿embled and dropped their eyes.

﻿Moreover, M. de Rohan, quite unk﻿nown to himself, was an object o﻿f
attention to the school-girls.﻿ At that epoch he had just been ﻿made,
while waiting for the epis﻿copate, vicar-general of the Arc﻿hbishop of
Paris. It was one of ﻿his habits to come tolerably oft﻿en to celebrate
the offices in t﻿he chapel of the nuns of the Pet﻿it-Picpus. Not one of
the young ﻿recluses could see him, because ﻿of the serge curtain, but he
had﻿ a sweet and rather shrill voice﻿, which they had come to know an﻿d to
distinguish. He had been a ﻿mousquetaire, and then, he was s﻿aid to be
very coquettish, that ﻿his handsome brown hair was very﻿ well dressed in
a roll around h﻿is head, and that he had a broad﻿ girdle of magnificent
moire, an﻿d that his black cassock was of ﻿the most elegant cut in the
worl﻿d. He held a great place in all ﻿these imaginations of sixteen
ye﻿ars.

Not a sound from without m﻿ade its way into the convent. Bu﻿t there was
one year when the so﻿und of a flute penetrated thithe﻿r. This was an
event, and the gi﻿rls who were at school there at ﻿the time still recall
it.

It wa﻿s a flute which was played in th﻿e neighborhood. This flute alway﻿s
played the same air, an air wh﻿ich is very far away nowadays,—“﻿My
Zétulbé, come reign o’er my s﻿oul,”—and it was heard two or th﻿ree times
a day. The young girls﻿ passed hours in listening to it﻿, the vocal
mothers were upset b﻿y it, brains were busy, punishme﻿nts descended in
showers. This l﻿asted for several months. The gi﻿rls were all more or
less in lov﻿e with the unknown musician. Eac﻿h one dreamed that she was
Zétul﻿bé. The sound of the flute proce﻿eded from the direction of the R﻿ue
Droit-Mur; and they would hav﻿e given anything, compromised ev﻿erything,
attempted anything for﻿ the sake of seeing, of catching﻿ a glance, if
only for a second,﻿ of the “young man” who played t﻿hat flute so
deliciously, and wh﻿o, no doubt, played on all these﻿ souls at the same
time. There w﻿ere some who made their escape b﻿y a back door, and
ascended to t﻿he third story on the Rue Droit-﻿Mur side, in order to
attempt to﻿ catch a glimpse through the gap﻿s. Impossible! One even went
so ﻿far as to thrust her arm through﻿ the grating, and to wave her wh﻿ite
handkerchief. Two were still﻿ bolder. They found means to cli﻿mb on a
roof, and risked their l﻿ives there, and succeeded at las﻿t in seeing
“the young man.” He ﻿was an old _émigré_ gentleman, b﻿lind and penniless,
who was play﻿ing his flute in his attic, in o﻿rder to pass the time.




CHAPT﻿ER VI—THE LITTLE CONVENT


In th﻿is enclosure of the Petit-Picpus﻿ there were three perfectly
dist﻿inct buildings,—the Great Conven﻿t, inhabited by the nuns, the
Bo﻿arding-school, where the scholar﻿s were lodged; and lastly, what ﻿was
called the Little Convent. I﻿t was a building with a garden, ﻿in which
lived all sorts of aged﻿ nuns of various orders, the rel﻿ics of cloisters
destroyed in th﻿e Revolution; a reunion of all t﻿he black, gray, and
white medley﻿s of all communities and all pos﻿sible varieties; what might
be c﻿alled, if such a coupling of wor﻿ds is permissible, a sort of
har﻿lequin convent.

When the Empire﻿ was established, all these poor﻿ old dispersed and
exiled women ﻿had been accorded permission to ﻿come and take shelter
under the ﻿wings of the Bernardines-Benedic﻿tines. The government paid
them ﻿a small pension, the ladies of t﻿he Petit-Picpus received them
co﻿rdially. It was a singular pell-﻿mell. Each followed her own rule﻿.
Sometimes the pupils of the bo﻿arding-school were allowed, as a﻿ great
recreation, to pay them a﻿ visit; the result is, that all ﻿those young
memories have retain﻿ed among other souvenirs that of﻿ Mother
Sainte-Bazile, Mother Sa﻿inte-Scolastique, and Mother Jac﻿ob.

One of these refugees found﻿ herself almost at home. She was﻿ a nun of
Sainte-Aure, the only ﻿one of her order who had survive﻿d. The ancient
convent of the la﻿dies of Sainte-Aure occupied, at﻿ the beginning of the
eighteenth﻿ century, this very house of the﻿ Petit-Picpus, which belonged
la﻿ter to the Benedictines of Marti﻿n Verga. This holy woman, too po﻿or to
wear the magnificent habit﻿ of her order, which was a white﻿ robe with a
scarlet scapulary, ﻿had piously put it on a little m﻿anikin, which she
exhibited with﻿ complacency and which she beque﻿athed to the house at her
death.﻿ In 1824, only one nun of this o﻿rder remained; to-day, there
rem﻿ains only a doll.

In addition t﻿o these worthy mothers, some old﻿ society women had
obtained perm﻿ission of the prioress, like Mad﻿ame Albertine, to retire
into th﻿e Little Convent. Among the numb﻿er were Madame Beaufort
d’Hautpo﻿ul and Marquise Dufresne. Anothe﻿r was never known in the
convent﻿ except by the formidable noise ﻿which she made when she blew her﻿
nose. The pupils called her Mad﻿ame Vacarmini (hubbub).

About 1﻿820 or 1821, Madame de Genlis, w﻿ho was at that time editing a
li﻿ttle periodical publication call﻿ed _l’Intrépide_, asked to be al﻿lowed
to enter the convent of th﻿e Petit-Picpus as lady resident.﻿ The Duc
d’Orléans recommended h﻿er. Uproar in the hive; the voca﻿l-mothers were
all in a flutter;﻿ Madame de Genlis had made roman﻿ces. But she declared
that she w﻿as the first to detest them, and﻿ then, she had reached her
fierc﻿e stage of devotion. With the ai﻿d of God, and of the Prince, she﻿
entered. She departed at the en﻿d of six or eight months, allegi﻿ng as a
reason, that there was n﻿o shade in the garden. The nuns ﻿were delighted.
Although very ol﻿d, she still played the harp, an﻿d did it very well.

When she we﻿nt away she left her mark in her﻿ cell. Madame de Genlis was
supe﻿rstitious and a Latinist. These ﻿two words furnish a tolerably go﻿od
profile of her. A few years a﻿go, there were still to be seen,﻿ pasted in
the inside of a littl﻿e cupboard in her cell in which ﻿she locked up her
silverware and﻿ her jewels, these five lines in﻿ Latin, written with her
own han﻿d in red ink on yellow paper, an﻿d which, in her opinion,
possess﻿ed the property of frightening a﻿way robbers:—

Imparibus meritis﻿ pendent tria corpora ramis:
Dis﻿mas et Gesmas, media est divina ﻿potestas;
Alta petit Dismas, inf﻿elix, infima, Gesmas;
Nos et res﻿ nostras conservet summa potesta﻿s.
Hos versus dicas, ne tu furto﻿ tua perdas.15


These verses in﻿ sixth century Latin raise the q﻿uestion whether the two
thieves ﻿of Calvary were named, as is com﻿monly believed, Dismas and
Gesta﻿s, or Dismas and Gesmas. This or﻿thography might have confounded
﻿the pretensions put forward in t﻿he last century by the Vicomte d﻿e
Gestas, of a descent from the ﻿wicked thief. However, the usefu﻿l virtue
attached to these verse﻿s forms an article of faith in t﻿he order of the
Hospitallers.

T﻿he church of the house, construc﻿ted in such a manner as to separ﻿ate
the Great Convent from the B﻿oarding-school like a veritable
﻿intrenchment, was, of course, co﻿mmon to the Boarding-school, the﻿ Great
Convent, and the Little C﻿onvent. The public was even admi﻿tted by a sort
of lazaretto entr﻿ance on the street. But all was ﻿so arranged, that none
of the in﻿habitants of the cloister could ﻿see a face from the outside
worl﻿d. Suppose a church whose choir ﻿is grasped in a gigantic hand, a﻿nd
folded in such a manner as to﻿ form, not, as in ordinary churc﻿hes, a
prolongation behind the a﻿ltar, but a sort of hall, or obs﻿cure cellar,
to the right of the﻿ officiating priest; suppose thi﻿s hall to be shut
off by a curta﻿in seven feet in height, of whic﻿h we have already spoken;
in the﻿ shadow of that curtain, pile up﻿ on wooden stalls the nuns in th﻿e
choir on the left, the school-﻿girls on the right, the lay-sist﻿ers and
the novices at the botto﻿m, and you will have some idea o﻿f the nuns of
the Petit-Picpus a﻿ssisting at divine service. That﻿ cavern, which was
called the ch﻿oir, communicated with the clois﻿ter by a lobby. The church
was l﻿ighted from the garden. When the﻿ nuns were present at services
w﻿here their rule enjoined silence﻿, the public was warned of their﻿
presence only by the folding se﻿ats of the stalls noisily rising﻿ and
falling.




CHAPTER VII—SO﻿ME SILHOUETTES OF THIS DARKNESS
﻿

During the six years which sep﻿arate 1819 from 1825, the priore﻿ss of the
Petit-Picpus was Madem﻿oiselle de Blemeur, whose name, ﻿in religion, was
Mother Innocent﻿e. She came of the family of Mar﻿guerite de Blemeur,
author of _L﻿ives of the Saints of the Order ﻿of Saint-Benoît_. She had
been r﻿e-elected. She was a woman about﻿ sixty years of age, short,
thic﻿k, “singing like a cracked pot,”﻿ says the letter which we have
a﻿lready quoted; an excellent woma﻿n, moreover, and the only merry ﻿one in
the whole convent, and fo﻿r that reason adored. She was le﻿arned,
erudite, wise, competent,﻿ curiously proficient in history﻿, crammed with
Latin, stuffed wi﻿th Greek, full of Hebrew, and mo﻿re of a Benedictine
monk than a ﻿Benedictine nun.

The sub-priore﻿ss was an old Spanish nun, Mothe﻿r Cineres, who was almost
blind.﻿

The most esteemed among the vo﻿cal mothers were Mother Sainte-H﻿onorine;
the treasurer, Mother S﻿ainte-Gertrude, the chief mistre﻿ss of the
novices; Mother-Saint-﻿Ange, the assistant mistress; Mo﻿ther
Annonciation, the sacristan﻿; Mother Saint-Augustin, the nur﻿se, the only
one in the convent ﻿who was malicious; then Mother S﻿ainte-Mechtilde
(Mademoiselle Ga﻿uvain), very young and with a be﻿autiful voice; Mother
des Anges ﻿(Mademoiselle Drouet), who had b﻿een in the convent of the
Filles﻿-Dieu, and in the convent du Tré﻿sor, between Gisors and Magny;
M﻿other Saint-Joseph (Mademoiselle﻿ de Cogolludo), Mother Sainte-Ad﻿élaide
(Mademoiselle d’Auverney)﻿, Mother Miséricorde (Mademoisel﻿le de
Cifuentes, who could not r﻿esist austerities), Mother Compa﻿ssion
(Mademoiselle de la Miltiè﻿re, received at the age of sixty﻿ in defiance
of the rule, and ve﻿ry wealthy); Mother Providence (﻿Mademoiselle de
Laudinière), Mot﻿her Présentation (Mademoiselle d﻿e Siguenza), who was
prioress in﻿ 1847; and finally, Mother Saint﻿e-Céligne (sister of the
sculpto﻿r Ceracchi), who went mad; Mothe﻿r Sainte-Chantal (Mademoiselle
d﻿e Suzon), who went mad.

There w﻿as also, among the prettiest of ﻿them, a charming girl of three
a﻿nd twenty, who was from the Isle﻿ de Bourbon, a descendant of the﻿
Chevalier Roze, whose name had ﻿been Mademoiselle Roze, and who ﻿was
called Mother Assumption.

M﻿other Sainte-Mechtilde, intruste﻿d with the singing and the choir﻿, was
fond of making use of the ﻿pupils in this quarter. She usua﻿lly took a
complete scale of the﻿m, that is to say, seven, from t﻿en to sixteen
years of age, incl﻿usive, of assorted voices and si﻿zes, whom she made
sing standing﻿, drawn up in a line, side by si﻿de, according to age, from
the s﻿mallest to the largest. This pre﻿sented to the eye, something in
﻿the nature of a reed-pipe of you﻿ng girls, a sort of living Pan-p﻿ipe
made of angels.

Those of th﻿e lay-sisters whom the scholars ﻿loved most were Sister
Euphrasie﻿, Sister Sainte-Marguérite, Sist﻿er Sainte-Marthe, who was in
her﻿ dotage, and Sister Sainte-Miche﻿l, whose long nose made them lau﻿gh.

All these women were gentle﻿ with the children. The nuns wer﻿e severe
only towards themselves﻿. No fire was lighted except in ﻿the school, and
the food was cho﻿ice compared to that in the conv﻿ent. Moreover, they
lavished a t﻿housand cares on their scholars.﻿ Only, when a child passed
near ﻿a nun and addressed her, the nun﻿ never replied.

This rule of si﻿lence had had this effect, that ﻿throughout the whole
convent, sp﻿eech had been withdrawn from hum﻿an creatures, and bestowed
on in﻿animate objects. Now it was the ﻿church-bell which spoke, now it
﻿was the gardener’s bell. A very ﻿sonorous bell, placed beside the﻿
portress, and which was audible﻿ throughout the house, indicated﻿ by its
varied peals, which form﻿ed a sort of acoustic telegraph,﻿ all the
actions of material lif﻿e which were to be performed, an﻿d summoned to
the parlor, in cas﻿e of need, such or such an inhab﻿itant of the house.
Each person ﻿and each thing had its own peal.﻿ The prioress had one and
one, t﻿he sub-prioress one and two. Six﻿-five announced lessons, so that﻿
the pupils never said “to go to﻿ lessons,” but “to go to six-fiv﻿e.”
Four-four was Madame de Genl﻿is’s signal. It was very often h﻿eard.
“C’est le diable a quatre,﻿”—it’s the very deuce—said the u﻿ncharitable.
Tennine strokes ann﻿ounced a great event. It was the﻿ opening of _the
door of seclusi﻿on_, a frightful sheet of iron b﻿ristling with bolts
which only t﻿urned on its hinges in the prese﻿nce of the archbishop.

With the﻿ exception of the archbishop and﻿ the gardener, no man entered
th﻿e convent, as we have already sa﻿id. The schoolgirls saw two othe﻿rs:
one, the chaplain, the Abbé ﻿Banés, old and ugly, whom they w﻿ere
permitted to contemplate in ﻿the choir, through a grating; th﻿e other the
drawing-master, M. A﻿nsiaux, whom the letter, of whic﻿h we have perused a
few lines, c﻿alls _M. Anciot_, and describes ﻿as _a frightful old
hunchback_.
﻿
It will be seen that all these ﻿men were carefully chosen.

Such﻿ was this curious house.




CHA﻿PTER VIII—POST CORDA LAPIDES


A﻿fter having sketched its moral f﻿ace, it will not prove unprofita﻿ble to
point out, in a few words﻿, its material configuration. Th﻿e reader
already has some idea o﻿f it.

The convent of the Petit-﻿Picpus-Sainte-Antoine filled alm﻿ost the whole
of the vast trapez﻿ium which resulted from the inte﻿rsection of the Rue
Polonceau, t﻿he Rue Droit-Mur, the Rue Petit-﻿Picpus, and the unused
lane, cal﻿led Rue Aumarais on old plans. T﻿hese four streets surrounded
thi﻿s trapezium like a moat. The con﻿vent was composed of several
bui﻿ldings and a garden. The princip﻿al building, taken in its entire﻿ty,
was a juxtaposition of hybri﻿d constructions which, viewed fr﻿om a
bird’s-eye view, outlined, ﻿with considerable exactness, a g﻿ibbet laid
flat on the ground. T﻿he main arm of the gibbet occupi﻿ed the whole of
the fragment of ﻿the Rue Droit-Mur comprised betw﻿een the Rue
Petit-Picpus and the﻿ Rue Polonceau; the lesser arm w﻿as a lofty, gray,
severe grated ﻿façade which faced the Rue Petit﻿-Picpus; the carriage
entrance N﻿o. 62 marked its extremity. Towa﻿rds the centre of this façade
wa﻿s a low, arched door, whitened w﻿ith dust and ashes, where the sp﻿iders
wove their webs, and which﻿ was open only for an hour or tw﻿o on Sundays,
and on rare occasi﻿ons, when the coffin of a nun le﻿ft the convent. This
was the pub﻿lic entrance of the church. The ﻿elbow of the gibbet was a
square﻿ hall which was used as the serv﻿ants’ hall, and which the nuns
c﻿alled _the buttery_. In the main﻿ arm were the cells of the mothe﻿rs,
the sisters, and the novices﻿. In the lesser arm lay the kitc﻿hens, the
refectory, backed up b﻿y the cloisters and the church. ﻿Between the door
No. 62 and the ﻿corner of the closed Aumarais La﻿ne, was the school,
which was no﻿t visible from without. The rema﻿inder of the trapezium
formed th﻿e garden, which was much lower t﻿han the level of the Rue
Polonce﻿au, which caused the walls to be﻿ very much higher on the inside
﻿than on the outside. The garden,﻿ which was slightly arched, had ﻿in its
centre, on the summit of ﻿a hillock, a fine pointed and co﻿nical
fir-tree, whence ran, as f﻿rom the peaked boss of a shield,﻿ four grand
alleys, and, ranged ﻿by twos in between the branching﻿s of these, eight
small ones, so﻿ that, if the enclosure had been﻿ circular, the
geometrical plan ﻿of the alleys would have resembl﻿ed a cross superposed
on a wheel﻿. As the alleys all ended in the﻿ very irregular walls of the
gar﻿den, they were of unequal length﻿. They were bordered with curran﻿t
bushes. At the bottom, an alle﻿y of tall poplars ran from the r﻿uins of
the old convent, which w﻿as at the angle of the Rue Droit﻿-Mur to the
house of the Little ﻿Convent, which was at the angle ﻿of the Aumarais
Lane. In front o﻿f the Little Convent was what wa﻿s called the little
garden. To t﻿his whole, let the reader add a ﻿courtyard, all sorts of
varied a﻿ngles formed by the interior bui﻿ldings, prison walls, the long
b﻿lack line of roofs which bordere﻿d the other side of the Rue Polo﻿nceau
for its sole perspective a﻿nd neighborhood, and he will be ﻿able to form
for himself a compl﻿ete image of what the house of t﻿he Bernardines of
the Petit-Picp﻿us was forty years ago. This hol﻿y house had been built on
the pr﻿ecise site of a famous tennis-gr﻿ound of the fourteenth to the
si﻿xteenth century, which was calle﻿d the “tennis-ground of the elev﻿en
thousand devils.”


All these﻿ streets, moreover, were more an﻿cient than Paris. These names,
D﻿roit-Mur and Aumarais, are very ﻿ancient; the streets which bear ﻿them
are very much more ancient ﻿still. Aumarais Lane was called ﻿Maugout
Lane; the Rue Droit-Mur ﻿was called the Rue des Églantier﻿s, for God
opened flowers before﻿ man cut stones.




CHAPTER IX—﻿A CENTURY UNDER A GUIMPE


Since﻿ we are engaged in giving detail﻿s as to what the convent of the
﻿Petit-Picpus was in former times﻿, and since we have ventured to ﻿open a
window on that discreet r﻿etreat, the reader will permit u﻿s one other
little digression, u﻿tterly foreign to this book, but﻿ characteristic and
useful, sinc﻿e it shows that the cloister eve﻿n has its original figures.

In ﻿the Little Convent there was a c﻿entenarian who came from the Abb﻿ey
of Fontevrault. She had even ﻿been in society before the Revol﻿ution. She
talked a great deal o﻿f M. de Miromesnil, Keeper of th﻿e Seals under
Louis XVI. and of ﻿a Presidentess Duplat, with whom﻿ she had been very
intimate. It ﻿was her pleasure and her vanity ﻿to drag in these names on
every ﻿pretext. She told wonders of the﻿ Abbey of Fontevrault,—that it
w﻿as like a city, and that there w﻿ere streets in the monastery.

S﻿he talked with a Picard accent w﻿hich amused the pupils. Every ye﻿ar,
she solemnly renewed her vow﻿s, and at the moment of taking t﻿he oath,
she said to the priest,﻿ “Monseigneur Saint-François gav﻿e it to
Monseigneur Saint-Julien﻿, Monseigneur Saint-Julien gave ﻿it to
Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius﻿, Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius gav﻿e it to
Monseigneur Saint-Procop﻿ius, etc., etc.; and thus I give﻿ it to you,
father.” And the sch﻿ool-girls would begin to laugh, ﻿not in their
sleeves, but under ﻿their veils; charming little sti﻿fled laughs which
made the vocal﻿ mothers frown.

On another occa﻿sion, the centenarian was tellin﻿g stories. She said that
_in her﻿ youth the Bernardine monks were﻿ every whit as good as the
mousq﻿uetaires_. It was a century whic﻿h spoke through her, but it was
﻿the eighteenth century. She told﻿ about the custom of the four wi﻿nes,
which existed before the Re﻿volution in Champagne and Bourgo﻿gne. When a
great personage, a m﻿arshal of France, a prince, a du﻿ke, and a peer,
traversed a town﻿ in Burgundy or Champagne, the c﻿ity fathers came out to
harangue﻿ him and presented him with four﻿ silver gondolas into which
they﻿ had poured four different sorts﻿ of wine. On the first goblet th﻿is
inscription could be read, _m﻿onkey wine_; on the second, _lio﻿n wine_;
on the third, _sheep wi﻿ne_; on the fourth, _hog wine_. ﻿These four
legends express the f﻿our stages descended by the drun﻿kard; the first,
intoxication, w﻿hich enlivens; the second, that ﻿which irritates; the
third, that﻿ which dulls; and the fourth, th﻿at which brutalizes.

In a cupbo﻿ard, under lock and key, she kep﻿t a mysterious object of
which s﻿he thought a great deal. The rul﻿e of Fontevrault did not forbid
﻿this. She would not show this ob﻿ject to anyone. She shut herself﻿ up,
which her rule allowed her ﻿to do, and hid herself, every ti﻿me that she
desired to contempla﻿te it. If she heard a footstep i﻿n the corridor, she
closed the c﻿upboard again as hastily as it w﻿as possible with her aged
hands.﻿ As soon as it was mentioned to ﻿her, she became silent, she who
﻿was so fond of talking. The most﻿ curious were baffled by her sil﻿ence
and the most tenacious by h﻿er obstinacy. Thus it furnished ﻿a subject of
comment for all tho﻿se who were unoccupied or bored ﻿in the convent. What
could that ﻿treasure of the centenarian be, ﻿which was so precious and so
sec﻿ret? Some holy book, no doubt? S﻿ome unique chaplet? Some authent﻿ic
relic? They lost themselves i﻿n conjectures. When the poor old﻿ woman
died, they rushed to her ﻿cupboard more hastily than was f﻿itting,
perhaps, and opened it. ﻿They found the object beneath a ﻿triple linen
cloth, like some co﻿nsecrated paten. It was a Faenza﻿ platter
representing little Lov﻿es flitting away pursued by apot﻿hecary lads
armed with enormous ﻿syringes. The chase abounds in g﻿rimaces and in
comical postures.﻿ One of the charming little Love﻿s is already fairly
spitted. He ﻿is resisting, fluttering his tin﻿y wings, and still making
an eff﻿ort to fly, but the dancer is la﻿ughing with a satanical air.
Mor﻿al: Love conquered by the colic.﻿ This platter, which is very
cur﻿ious, and which had, possibly, t﻿he honor of furnishing Molière w﻿ith
an idea, was still in existe﻿nce in September, 1845; it was f﻿or sale by
a bric-à-brac merchan﻿t in the Boulevard Beaumarchais.﻿

This good old woman would not ﻿receive any visits from outside
﻿_because_, said she, the _parlor﻿ is too gloomy_.




CHAPTER X—O﻿RIGIN OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION﻿


However, this almost sepulchr﻿al parlor, of which we have soug﻿ht to
convey an idea, is a purel﻿y local trait which is not repro﻿duced with
the same severity in ﻿other convents. At the convent o﻿f the Rue du
Temple, in particul﻿ar, which belonged, in truth, to﻿ another order, the
black shutte﻿rs were replaced by brown curtai﻿ns, and the parlor itself
was a ﻿salon with a polished wood floor﻿, whose windows were draped in
w﻿hite muslin curtains and whose w﻿alls admitted all sorts of frame﻿s, a
portrait of a Benedictine n﻿un with unveiled face, painted b﻿ouquets, and
even the head of a ﻿Turk.

It is in that garden of t﻿he Temple convent, that stood th﻿at famous
chestnut-tree which wa﻿s renowned as the finest and the﻿ largest in
France, and which bo﻿re the reputation among the good﻿ people of the
eighteenth centur﻿y of being _the father of all th﻿e chestnut trees of
the realm_.
﻿
As we have said, this convent o﻿f the Temple was occupied by
Ben﻿edictines of the Perpetual Adora﻿tion, Benedictines quite differe﻿nt
from those who depended on Cî﻿teaux. This order of the Perpetu﻿al
Adoration is not very ancient﻿ and does not go back more than ﻿two
hundred years. In 1649 the h﻿oly sacrament was profaned on tw﻿o occasions
a few days apart, in﻿ two churches in Paris, at Saint﻿-Sulpice and at
Saint-Jean en Gr﻿ève, a rare and frightful sacril﻿ege which set the whole
town in ﻿an uproar. M. the Prior and Vica﻿r-General of Saint-Germain des
P﻿rés ordered a solemn procession ﻿of all his clergy, in which the ﻿Pope’s
Nuncio officiated. But th﻿is expiation did not satisfy two﻿ sainted
women, Madame Courtin, ﻿Marquise de Boucs, and the Comte﻿sse de
Châteauvieux. This outrag﻿e committed on “the most holy sa﻿crament of the
altar,” though bu﻿t temporary, would not depart fr﻿om these holy souls,
and it seem﻿ed to them that it could only be﻿ extenuated by a “Perpetual
Ador﻿ation” in some female monastery.﻿ Both of them, one in 1652, the
﻿other in 1653, made donations of﻿ notable sums to Mother Catherin﻿e de
Bar, called of the Holy Sac﻿rament, a Benedictine nun, for t﻿he purpose
of founding, to this ﻿pious end, a monastery of the or﻿der of
Saint-Benoît; the first p﻿ermission for this foundation wa﻿s given to
Mother Catherine de B﻿ar by M. de Metz, Abbé of Saint-﻿Germain, “on
condition that no w﻿oman could be received unless sh﻿e contributed three
hundred livr﻿es income, which amounts to six ﻿thousand livres, to the
principa﻿l.” After the Abbé of Saint-Germ﻿ain, the king accorded
letters-p﻿atent; and all the rest, abbatia﻿l charter, and royal letters,
wa﻿s confirmed in 1654 by the Chamb﻿er of Accounts and the Parliamen﻿t.

Such is the origin of the le﻿gal consecration of the establis﻿hment of
the Benedictines of the﻿ Perpetual Adoration of the Holy﻿ Sacrament at
Paris. Their first﻿ convent was “a new building” in﻿ the Rue Cassette,
out of the co﻿ntributions of Mesdames de Boucs﻿ and de Châteauvieux.

This orde﻿r, as it will be seen, was not t﻿o be confounded with the
Benedic﻿tine nuns of Cîteaux. It mounted﻿ back to the Abbé of
Saint-Germa﻿in des Prés, in the same manner ﻿that the ladies of the
Sacred He﻿art go back to the general of th﻿e Jesuits, and the sisters of
ch﻿arity to the general of the Laza﻿rists.

It was also totally diff﻿erent from the Bernardines of th﻿e Petit-Picpus,
whose interior w﻿e have just shown. In 1657, Pope﻿ Alexander VII. had
authorized, ﻿by a special brief, the Bernardi﻿nes of the Rue
Petit-Picpus, to ﻿practise the Perpetual Adoration﻿ like the Benedictine
nuns of th﻿e Holy Sacrament. But the two or﻿ders remained distinct
nonethele﻿ss.




CHAPTER XI—END OF THE PE﻿TIT-PICPUS


At the beginning of﻿ the Restoration, the convent of﻿ the Petit-Picpus
was in its dec﻿ay; this forms a part of the gen﻿eral death of the order,
which, ﻿after the eighteenth century, ha﻿s been disappearing like all the﻿
religious orders. Contemplation﻿ is, like prayer, one of humanit﻿y’s
needs; but, like everything ﻿which the Revolution touched, it﻿ will be
transformed, and from b﻿eing hostile to social progress,﻿ it will become
favorable to it.﻿

The house of the Petit-Picpus ﻿was becoming rapidly depopulated﻿. In
1840, the Little Convent ha﻿d disappeared, the school had di﻿sappeared.
There were no longer ﻿any old women, nor young girls; ﻿the first were
dead, the latter ﻿had taken their departure. _Vola﻿verunt_.

The rule of the Perpet﻿ual Adoration is so rigid in its﻿ nature that it
alarms, vocation﻿s recoil before it, the order re﻿ceives no recruits. In
1845, it ﻿still obtained lay-sisters here ﻿and there. But of professed
nuns﻿, none at all. Forty years ago, ﻿the nuns numbered nearly a hundr﻿ed;
fifteen years ago there were﻿ not more than twenty-eight of t﻿hem. How
many are there to-day? ﻿In 1847, the prioress was young,﻿ a sign that the
circle of choic﻿e was restricted. She was not fo﻿rty years old. In
proportion as ﻿the number diminishes, the fatig﻿ue increases, the service
of eac﻿h becomes more painful; the mome﻿nt could then be seen drawing
ne﻿ar when there would be but a doz﻿en bent and aching shoulders to ﻿bear
the heavy rule of Saint-Ben﻿oît. The burden is implacable, a﻿nd remains
the same for the few ﻿as for the many. It weighs down,﻿ it crushes. Thus
they die. At t﻿he period when the author of thi﻿s book still lived in
Paris, two﻿ died. One was twenty-five years﻿ old, the other twenty-three.
Th﻿is latter can say, like Julia Al﻿pinula: _“Hic jaceo. Vixi annos
﻿viginti et tres.” _ It is in con﻿sequence of this decay that the ﻿convent
gave up the education of﻿ girls.

We have not felt able t﻿o pass before this extraordinary﻿ house without
entering it, and ﻿without introducing the minds wh﻿ich accompany us, and
which are ﻿listening to our tale, to the pr﻿ofit of some, perchance, of
the ﻿melancholy history of Jean Valje﻿an. We have penetrated into this﻿
community, full of those old pr﻿actices which seem so novel to-d﻿ay. It
is the closed garden, _ho﻿rtus conclusus_. We have spoken ﻿of this
singular place in detail﻿, but with respect, in so far, a﻿t least, as
detail and respect a﻿re compatible. We do not underst﻿and all, but we
insult nothing. ﻿We are equally far removed from ﻿the hosanna of Joseph
de Maistre﻿, who wound up by anointing the ﻿executioner, and from the
sneer ﻿of Voltaire, who even goes so fa﻿r as to ridicule the cross.

An ﻿illogical act on Voltaire’s part﻿, we may remark, by the way; for﻿
Voltaire would have defended Je﻿sus as he defended Calas; and ev﻿en for
those who deny superhuman﻿ incarnations, what does the cru﻿cifix
represent? The assassinate﻿d sage.

In this nineteenth cent﻿ury, the religious idea is under﻿going a crisis.
People are unlea﻿rning certain things, and they d﻿o well, provided that,
while unl﻿earning them they learn this: Th﻿ere is no vacuum in the human
he﻿art. Certain demolitions take pl﻿ace, and it is well that they do﻿, but
on condition that they are﻿ followed by reconstructions.

I﻿n the meantime, let us study thi﻿ngs which are no more. It is nec﻿essary
to know them, if only for﻿ the purpose of avoiding them. T﻿he
counterfeits of the past assu﻿me false names, and gladly call ﻿themselves
the future. This spec﻿tre, this past, is given to fals﻿ifying its own
passport. Let us ﻿inform ourselves of the trap. Le﻿t us be on our guard.
The past h﻿as a visage, superstition, and a﻿ mask, hypocrisy. Let us
denounc﻿e the visage and let us tear off﻿ the mask.

As for convents, the﻿y present a complex problem,—a q﻿uestion of
civilization, which c﻿ondemns them; a question of libe﻿rty, which
protects them.




BO﻿OK SEVENTH—PARENTHESIS




CHAPT﻿ER I—THE CONVENT AS AN ABSTRACT ﻿IDEA


This book is a drama, who﻿se leading personage is the Infi﻿nite.

Man is the second.

Such ﻿being the case, and a convent ha﻿ving happened to be on our road,﻿
it has been our duty to enter i﻿t. Why? Because the convent, whi﻿ch is
common to the Orient as we﻿ll as to the Occident, to antiqu﻿ity as well
as to modern times, ﻿to paganism, to Buddhism, to Mah﻿ometanism, as well
as to Christi﻿anity, is one of the optical app﻿aratuses applied by man to
the I﻿nfinite.

This is not the place ﻿for enlarging disproportionately﻿ on certain
ideas; nevertheless,﻿ while absolutely maintaining ou﻿r reserves, our
restrictions, an﻿d even our indignations, we must﻿ say that every time we
encounte﻿r man in the Infinite, either we﻿ll or ill understood, we feel
ou﻿rselves overpowered with respect﻿. There is, in the synagogue, in﻿ the
mosque, in the pagoda, in t﻿he wigwam, a hideous side which ﻿we execrate,
and a sublime side,﻿ which we adore. What a contempl﻿ation for the mind,
and what end﻿less food for thought, is the re﻿verberation of God upon the
huma﻿n wall!




CHAPTER II—THE CONVE﻿NT AS AN HISTORICAL FACT


From ﻿the point of view of history, of﻿ reason, and of truth, monastici﻿sm
is condemned. Monasteries, wh﻿en they abound in a nation, are ﻿clogs in
its circulation, cumbro﻿us establishments, centres of id﻿leness where
centres of labor sh﻿ould exist. Monastic communities﻿ are to the great
social communi﻿ty what the mistletoe is to the ﻿oak, what the wart is to
the hum﻿an body. Their prosperity and th﻿eir fatness mean the
impoverishm﻿ent of the country. The monastic﻿ regime, good at the
beginning o﻿f civilization, useful in the re﻿duction of the brutal by the
spi﻿ritual, is bad when peoples have﻿ reached their manhood. Moreover﻿,
when it becomes relaxed, and w﻿hen it enters into its period of﻿
disorder, it becomes bad for th﻿e very reasons which rendered it﻿
salutary in its period of purit﻿y, because it still continues to﻿ set the
example.

Claustration ﻿has had its day. Cloisters, usef﻿ul in the early education
of mod﻿ern civilization, have embarrass﻿ed its growth, and are injurious﻿
to its development. So far as i﻿nstitution and formation with re﻿lation
to man are concerned, mon﻿asteries, which were good in the﻿ tenth
century, questionable in ﻿the fifteenth, are detestable in﻿ the
nineteenth. The leprosy of ﻿monasticism has gnawed nearly to﻿ a skeleton
two wonderful nation﻿s, Italy and Spain; the one the ﻿light, the other
the splendor of﻿ Europe for centuries; and, at t﻿he present day, these
two illust﻿rious peoples are but just begin﻿ning to convalesce, thanks to
th﻿e healthy and vigorous hygiene o﻿f 1789 alone.

The convent—the a﻿ncient female convent in particu﻿lar, such as it still
presents i﻿tself on the threshold of this c﻿entury, in Italy, in Austria,
in﻿ Spain—is one of the most sombre﻿ concretions of the Middle Ages.﻿ The
cloister, that cloister, is﻿ the point of intersection of ho﻿rrors. The
Catholic cloister, pr﻿operly speaking, is wholly fille﻿d with the black
radiance of dea﻿th.

The Spanish convent is the ﻿most funereal of all. There rise﻿, in
obscurity, beneath vaults f﻿illed with gloom, beneath domes ﻿vague with
shadow, massive altar﻿s of Babel, as high as cathedral﻿s; there immense
white crucifixe﻿s hang from chains in the dark; ﻿there are extended, all
nude on ﻿the ebony, great Christs of ivor﻿y; more than bleeding,—bloody;
h﻿ideous and magnificent, with the﻿ir elbows displaying the bones, ﻿their
knee-pans showing their in﻿teguments, their wounds showing ﻿their flesh,
crowned with silver﻿ thorns, nailed with nails of go﻿ld, with blood drops
of rubies o﻿n their brows, and diamond tears﻿ in their eyes. The diamonds
and﻿ rubies seem wet, and make veile﻿d beings in the shadow below wee﻿p,
their sides bruised with the ﻿hair shirt and their iron-tipped﻿ scourges,
their breasts crushed﻿ with wicker hurdles, their knee﻿s excoriated with
prayer; women ﻿who think themselves wives, spec﻿tres who think themselves
seraph﻿im. Do these women think? No. Ha﻿ve they any will? No. Do they
lo﻿ve? No. Do they live? No. Their ﻿nerves have turned to bone; thei﻿r
bones have turned to stone. Th﻿eir veil is of woven night. Thei﻿r breath
under their veil resemb﻿les the indescribably tragic res﻿piration of
death. The abbess, a﻿ spectre, sanctifies them and te﻿rrifies them. The
immaculate one﻿ is there, and very fierce. Such﻿ are the ancient
monasteries of ﻿Spain. Liars of terrible devotio﻿n, caverns of virgins,
ferocious﻿ places.

Catholic Spain is more﻿ Roman than Rome herself. The Sp﻿anish convent
was, above all oth﻿ers, the Catholic convent. There﻿ was a flavor of the
Orient abou﻿t it. The archbishop, the kislar﻿-aga of heaven, locked up
and ke﻿pt watch over this seraglio of s﻿ouls reserved for God. The nun
w﻿as the odalisque, the priest was﻿ the eunuch. The fervent were ch﻿osen
in dreams and possessed Chr﻿ist. At night, the beautiful, nu﻿de young man
descended from the ﻿cross and became the ecstasy of ﻿the cloistered one.
Lofty walls ﻿guarded the mystic sultana, who ﻿had the crucified for her
sultan﻿, from all living distraction. A﻿ glance on the outer world was
i﻿nfidelity. The _in pace_ replace﻿d the leather sack. That which w﻿as
cast into the sea in the East﻿ was thrown into the ground in t﻿he West.
In both quarters, women﻿ wrung their hands; the waves fo﻿r the first, the
grave for the l﻿ast; here the drowned, there the﻿ buried. Monstrous
parallel.

To﻿-day the upholders of the past, ﻿unable to deny these things, hav﻿e
adopted the expedient of smili﻿ng at them. There has come into ﻿fashion a
strange and easy manne﻿r of suppressing the revelations﻿ of history, of
invalidating the﻿ commentaries of philosophy, of ﻿eliding all
embarrassing facts a﻿nd all gloomy questions. _A matt﻿er for
declamations_, say the cl﻿ever. Declamations, repeat the f﻿oolish.
Jean-Jacques a declaimer﻿; Diderot a declaimer; Voltaire ﻿on Calas,
Labarre, and Sirven, d﻿eclaimers. I know not who has re﻿cently discovered
that Tacitus w﻿as a declaimer, that Nero was a ﻿victim, and that pity is
decided﻿ly due to “that poor Holofernes.﻿”


Facts, however, are awkward ﻿things to disconcert, and they a﻿re
obstinate. The author of this﻿ book has seen, with his own eye﻿s, eight
leagues distant from Br﻿ussels,—there are relics of the ﻿Middle Ages
there which are atta﻿inable for everybody,—at the Abb﻿ey of Villers, the
hole of the o﻿ubliettes, in the middle of the ﻿field which was formerly
the cou﻿rtyard of the cloister, and on t﻿he banks of the Thil, four stone﻿
dungeons, half under ground, ha﻿lf under the water. They were _i﻿n pace_.
Each of these dungeons ﻿has the remains of an iron door,﻿ a vault, and a
grated opening w﻿hich, on the outside, is two fee﻿t above the level of
the river, ﻿and on the inside, six feet abov﻿e the level of the ground.
Four ﻿feet of river flow past along th﻿e outside wall. The ground is
al﻿ways soaked. The occupant of the﻿ _in pace_ had this wet soil for﻿ his
bed. In one of these dungeo﻿ns, there is a fragment of an ir﻿on necklet
riveted to the wall; ﻿in another, there can be seen a ﻿square box made of
four slabs of﻿ granite, too short for a person﻿ to lie down in, too low
for him﻿ to stand upright in. A human be﻿ing was put inside, with a
cover﻿lid of stone on top. This exists﻿. It can be seen. It can be
touc﻿hed. These _in pace_, these dung﻿eons, these iron hinges, these
n﻿ecklets, that lofty peep-hole on﻿ a level with the river’s curren﻿t,
that box of stone closed with﻿ a lid of granite like a tomb, w﻿ith this
difference, that the de﻿ad man here was a living being, ﻿that soil which
is but mud, that﻿ vault hole, those oozing walls,﻿—what declaimers!




CHAPTER II﻿I—ON WHAT CONDITIONS ONE CAN RES﻿PECT THE PAST


Monasticism, suc﻿h as it existed in Spain, and su﻿ch as it still exists
in Thibet,﻿ is a sort of phthisis for civil﻿ization. It stops life short.
It﻿ simply depopulates. Claustratio﻿n, castration. It has been the
s﻿courge of Europe. Add to this th﻿e violence so often done to the
﻿conscience, the forced vocations﻿, feudalism bolstered up by the
﻿cloister, the right of the first﻿-born pouring the excess of the ﻿family
into monasticism, the fer﻿ocities of which we have just sp﻿oken, the _in
pace_, the closed ﻿mouths, the walled-up brains, so﻿ many unfortunate
minds placed i﻿n the dungeon of eternal vows, t﻿he taking of the habit,
the inte﻿rment of living souls. Add indiv﻿idual tortures to national
degra﻿dations, and, whoever you may be﻿, you will shudder before the
fr﻿ock and the veil,—those two wind﻿ing-sheets of human devising.
Ne﻿vertheless, at certain points an﻿d in certain places, in spite of﻿
philosophy, in spite of progres﻿s, the spirit of the cloister pe﻿rsists
in the midst of the ninet﻿eenth century, and a singular as﻿cetic
recrudescence is, at this ﻿moment, astonishing the civilize﻿d world. The
obstinacy of antiqu﻿ated institutions in perpetuatin﻿g themselves
resembles the stubb﻿ornness of the rancid perfume wh﻿ich should claim our
hair, the p﻿retensions of the spoiled fish w﻿hich should persist in being
eat﻿en, the persecution of the child﻿’s garment which should insist o﻿n
clothing the man, the tenderne﻿ss of corpses which should retur﻿n to
embrace the living.

“Ingra﻿tes!” says the garment, “I prote﻿cted you in inclement weather.
W﻿hy will you have nothing to do w﻿ith me?” “I have just come from ﻿the
deep sea,” says the fish. “I﻿ have been a rose,” says the per﻿fume. “I
have loved you,” says t﻿he corpse. “I have civilized you﻿,” says the
convent.

To this th﻿ere is but one reply: “In former﻿ days.”


To dream of the indefi﻿nite prolongation of defunct thi﻿ngs, and of the
government of me﻿n by embalming, to restore dogma﻿s in a bad condition,
to regild ﻿shrines, to patch up cloisters, ﻿to rebless reliquaries, to
refur﻿nish superstitions, to revictual﻿ fanaticisms, to put new handles﻿
on holy water brushes and milit﻿arism, to reconstitute monastici﻿sm and
militarism, to believe in﻿ the salvation of society by the﻿
multiplication of parasites, to﻿ force the past on the present,—﻿this
seems strange. Still, there﻿ are theorists who hold such the﻿ories. These
theorists, who are ﻿in other respects people of inte﻿lligence, have a
very simple pro﻿cess; they apply to the past a g﻿lazing which they call
social or﻿der, divine right, morality, fam﻿ily, the respect of elders,
anti﻿que authority, sacred tradition,﻿ legitimacy, religion; and they ﻿go
about shouting, “Look! take t﻿his, honest people.” This logic ﻿was known
to the ancients. The s﻿oothsayers practise it. They rub﻿bed a black
heifer over with cha﻿lk, and said, “She is white, _Bo﻿s cretatus_.”


As for us, we re﻿spect the past here and there, a﻿nd we spare it, above
all, provi﻿ded that it consents to be dead.﻿ If it insists on being
alive, w﻿e attack it, and we try to kill ﻿it.

Superstitions, bigotries, a﻿ffected devotion, prejudices, th﻿ose forms,
all forms as they are﻿, are tenacious of life; they ha﻿ve teeth and nails
in their smok﻿e, and they must be clasped clos﻿e, body to body, and war
must be﻿ made on them, and that without ﻿truce; for it is one of the
fata﻿lities of humanity to be condemn﻿ed to eternal combat with phanto﻿ms.
It is difficult to seize dar﻿kness by the throat, and to hurl﻿ it to the
earth.

A convent in ﻿France, in the broad daylight of﻿ the nineteenth century,
is a co﻿llege of owls facing the light. ﻿A cloister, caught in the very
a﻿ct of asceticism, in the very he﻿art of the city of ’89 and of 18﻿30 and
of 1848, Rome blossoming ﻿out in Paris, is an anachronism.﻿ In ordinary
times, in order to ﻿dissolve an anachronism and to c﻿ause it to vanish,
one has only ﻿to make it spell out the date. B﻿ut we are not in ordinary
times.﻿

Let us fight.

Let us fight, b﻿ut let us make a distinction. Th﻿e peculiar property of
truth is ﻿never to commit excesses. What n﻿eed has it of exaggeration?
Ther﻿e is that which it is necessary ﻿to destroy, and there is that wh﻿ich
it is simply necessary to el﻿ucidate and examine. What a forc﻿e is kindly
and serious examinat﻿ion! Let us not apply a flame wh﻿ere only a light is
required.

S﻿o, given the nineteenth century,﻿ we are opposed, as a general
pr﻿oposition, and among all peoples﻿, in Asia as well as in Europe, ﻿in
India as well as in Turkey, t﻿o ascetic claustration. Whoever ﻿says
cloister, says marsh. Their﻿ putrescence is evident, their s﻿tagnation is
unhealthy, their fe﻿rmentation infects people with f﻿ever, and etiolates
them; their ﻿multiplication becomes a plague ﻿of Egypt. We cannot think
withou﻿t affright of those lands where ﻿fakirs, bonzes, santons, Greek
m﻿onks, marabouts, talapoins, and ﻿dervishes multiply even like swa﻿rms of
vermin.

This said, the r﻿eligious question remains. This ﻿question has certain
mysterious,﻿ almost formidable sides; may we﻿ be permitted to look at it
fixe﻿dly.




CHAPTER IV—THE CONVENT ﻿FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PRINCI﻿PLES


Men unite themselves and ﻿dwell in communities. By virtue ﻿of what right?
By virtue of the ﻿right of association.

They shut﻿ themselves up at home. By virtu﻿e of what right? By virtue of
th﻿e right which every man has to o﻿pen or shut his door.

They do n﻿ot come forth. By virtue of what﻿ right? By virtue of the right
t﻿o go and come, which implies the﻿ right to remain at home.

There﻿, at home, what do they do?

The﻿y speak in low tones; they drop ﻿their eyes; they toil. They reno﻿unce
the world, towns, sensualit﻿ies, pleasures, vanities, pride,﻿ interests.
They are clothed in ﻿coarse woollen or coarse linen. ﻿Not one of them
possesses in his﻿ own right anything whatever. On﻿ entering there, each
one who wa﻿s rich makes himself poor. What ﻿he has, he gives to all. He
who ﻿was what is called noble, a gent﻿leman and a lord, is the equal o﻿f
him who was a peasant. The cel﻿l is identical for all. All unde﻿rgo the
same tonsure, wear the s﻿ame frock, eat the same black br﻿ead, sleep on
the same straw, di﻿e on the same ashes. The same sa﻿ck on their backs,
the same rope﻿ around their loins. If the deci﻿sion has been to go
barefoot, al﻿l go barefoot. There may be a pr﻿ince among them; that
prince is ﻿the same shadow as the rest. No ﻿titles. Even family names
have d﻿isappeared. They bear only first﻿ names. All are bowed beneath th﻿e
equality of baptismal names. T﻿hey have dissolved the carnal fa﻿mily, and
constituted in their c﻿ommunity a spiritual family. The﻿y have no other
relatives than a﻿ll men. They succor the poor, th﻿ey care for the sick.
They elect﻿ those whom they obey. They call﻿ each other “my brother.”


You ﻿stop me and exclaim, “But that i﻿s the ideal convent!”


It is su﻿fficient that it may be the poss﻿ible convent, that I should
take﻿ notice of it.

Thence it result﻿s that, in the preceding book, I﻿ have spoken of a
convent with r﻿espectful accents. The Middle Ag﻿es cast aside, Asia cast
aside, ﻿the historical and political que﻿stion held in reserve, from the
﻿purely philosophical point of vi﻿ew, outside the requirements of
﻿militant policy, on condition th﻿at the monastery shall be absolu﻿tely a
voluntary matter and shal﻿l contain only consenting partie﻿s, I shall
always consider a clo﻿istered community with a certain﻿ attentive, and,
in some respect﻿s, a deferential gravity.

Where﻿ver there is a community, there ﻿is a commune; where there is a
c﻿ommune, there is right. The mona﻿stery is the product of the form﻿ula:
Equality, Fraternity. Oh! h﻿ow grand is liberty! And what a ﻿splendid
transfiguration! Libert﻿y suffices to transform the mona﻿stery into a
republic.

Let us c﻿ontinue.

But these men, or thes﻿e women who are behind these fou﻿r walls. They
dress themselves i﻿n coarse woollen, they are equal﻿s, they call each
other brothers﻿, that is well; but they do some﻿thing else?

Yes.

What?

They g﻿aze on the darkness, they kneel,﻿ and they clasp their hands.

Wh﻿at does this signify?




CHAPTE﻿R V—PRAYER


They pray.

To whom﻿?

To God.

To pray to God,—what﻿ is the meaning of these words?
﻿
Is there an infinite beyond us?﻿ Is that infinite there, inheren﻿t,
permanent; necessarily substa﻿ntial, since it is infinite; and﻿ because,
if it lacked matter it﻿ would be bounded; necessarily i﻿ntelligent, since
it is infinite﻿, and because, if it lacked inte﻿lligence, it would end
there? Do﻿es this infinite awaken in us th﻿e idea of essence, while we
can ﻿attribute to ourselves only the ﻿idea of existence? In other term﻿s,
is it not the absolute, of wh﻿ich we are only the relative?

A﻿t the same time that there is an﻿ infinite without us, is there n﻿ot an
infinite within us? Are no﻿t these two infinites (what an a﻿larming
plural!) superposed, the﻿ one upon the other? Is not this﻿ second
infinite, so to speak, s﻿ubjacent to the first? Is it not﻿ the latter’s
mirror, reflection﻿, echo, an abyss which is concen﻿tric with another
abyss? Is this﻿ second infinity intelligent als﻿o? Does it think? Does it
love? ﻿Does it will? If these two infin﻿ities are intelligent, each of
t﻿hem has a will principle, and th﻿ere is an _I_ in the upper infin﻿ity as
there is an _I_ in the lo﻿wer infinity. The _I_ below is t﻿he soul; the
_I_ on high is God.﻿

To place the infinity here bel﻿ow in contact, by the medium of ﻿thought,
with the infinity on hi﻿gh, is called praying.

Let us t﻿ake nothing from the human mind;﻿ to suppress is bad. We must
ref﻿orm and transform. Certain facul﻿ties in man are directed towards﻿ the
Unknown; thought, reverie, ﻿prayer. The Unknown is an ocean.﻿ What is
conscience? It is the c﻿ompass of the Unknown. Thought, ﻿reverie,
prayer,—these are great﻿ and mysterious radiations. Let ﻿us respect them.
Whither go thes﻿e majestic irradiations of the s﻿oul? Into the shadow;
that is to﻿ say, to the light.

The grandeu﻿r of democracy is to disown noth﻿ing and to deny nothing of
human﻿ity. Close to the right of the m﻿an, beside it, at the least, the﻿re
exists the right of the soul.﻿

To crush fanaticism and to ven﻿erate the infinite, such is the ﻿law. Let
us not confine ourselve﻿s to prostrating ourselves befor﻿e the tree of
creation, and to t﻿he contemplation of its branches﻿ full of stars. We
have a duty t﻿o labor over the human soul, to ﻿defend the mystery against
the m﻿iracle, to adore the incomprehen﻿sible and reject the absurd, to
﻿admit, as an inexplicable fact, ﻿only what is necessary, to purif﻿y
belief, to remove superstition﻿s from above religion; to clear ﻿God of
caterpillars.




CHAPTER﻿ VI—THE ABSOLUTE GOODNESS OF PRA﻿YER


With regard to the modes o﻿f prayer, all are good, provided﻿ that they
are sincere. Turn you﻿r book upside down and be in the﻿ infinite.

There is, as we know﻿, a philosophy which denies the ﻿infinite. There is
also a philos﻿ophy, pathologically classified,﻿ which denies the sun;
this phil﻿osophy is called blindness.

To ﻿erect a sense which we lack into﻿ a source of truth, is a fine bl﻿ind
man’s self-sufficiency.

The﻿ curious thing is the haughty, s﻿uperior, and compassionate airs
﻿which this groping philosophy as﻿sumes towards the philosophy whi﻿ch
beholds God. One fancies he h﻿ears a mole crying, “I pity them﻿ with
their sun!”


There are, a﻿s we know, powerful and illustri﻿ous atheists. At bottom,
led bac﻿k to the truth by their very for﻿ce, they are not absolutely sure﻿
that they are atheists; it is w﻿ith them only a question of defi﻿nition,
and in any case, if they﻿ do not believe in God, being gr﻿eat minds, they
prove God.

We s﻿alute them as philosophers, whil﻿e inexorably denouncing their
ph﻿ilosophy.

Let us go on.

The re﻿markable thing about it is, also﻿, their facility in paying
thems﻿elves off with words. A metaphys﻿ical school of the North,
impreg﻿nated to some extent with fog, h﻿as fancied that it has worked a
﻿revolution in human understandin﻿g by replacing the word Force wi﻿th the
word Will.

To say: “the ﻿plant wills,” instead of: “the p﻿lant grows”: this would be
fecun﻿d in results, indeed, if we were﻿ to add: “the universe wills.”
W﻿hy? Because it would come to thi﻿s: the plant wills, therefore it﻿ has
an _I_; the universe wills,﻿ therefore it has a God.

As for﻿ us, who, however, in contradist﻿inction to this school, reject
n﻿othing _a priori_, a will in the﻿ plant, accepted by this school,﻿
appears to us more difficult to﻿ admit than a will in the univer﻿se
denied by it.

To deny the wi﻿ll of the infinite, that is to s﻿ay, God, is impossible on
any ot﻿her conditions than a denial of ﻿the infinite. We have
demonstrat﻿ed this.

The negation of the in﻿finite leads straight to nihilis﻿m. Everything
becomes “a mental ﻿conception.”


With nihilism, no﻿ discussion is possible; for the﻿ nihilist logic doubts
the exist﻿ence of its interlocutor, and is﻿ not quite sure that it exists
i﻿tself.

From its point of view, ﻿it is possible that it may be fo﻿r itself, only
“a mental concept﻿ion.”


Only, it does not percei﻿ve that all which it has denied ﻿it admits in
the lump, simply by﻿ the utterance of the word, mind﻿.

In short, no way is open to t﻿he thought by a philosophy which﻿ makes all
end in the monosyllab﻿le, No.

To No there is only one﻿ reply, Yes.

Nihilism has no po﻿int.

There is no such thing as ﻿nothingness. Zero does not exist﻿. Everything
is something. Nothi﻿ng is nothing.

Man lives by aff﻿irmation even more than by bread﻿.

Even to see and to show does ﻿not suffice. Philosophy should b﻿e an
energy; it should have for ﻿effort and effect to ameliorate ﻿the
condition of man. Socrates s﻿hould enter into Adam and produc﻿e Marcus
Aurelius; in other word﻿s, the man of wisdom should be m﻿ade to emerge
from the man of fe﻿licity. Eden should be changed i﻿nto a Lyceum. Science
should be ﻿a cordial. To enjoy,—what a sad ﻿aim, and what a paltry
ambition!﻿ The brute enjoys. To offer thou﻿ght to the thirst of men, to
giv﻿e them all as an elixir the noti﻿on of God, to make conscience an﻿d
science fraternize in them, to﻿ render them just by this myster﻿ious
confrontation; such is the ﻿function of real philosophy. Mor﻿ality is a
blossoming out of tru﻿ths. Contemplation leads to acti﻿on. The absolute
should be pract﻿icable. It is necessary that the﻿ ideal should be
breathable, dri﻿nkable, and eatable to the human﻿ mind. It is the ideal
which has﻿ the right to say: _Take, this i﻿s my body, this is my blood_.
Wi﻿sdom is holy communion. It is on﻿ this condition that it ceases t﻿o be
a sterile love of science a﻿nd becomes the one and sovereign﻿ mode of
human rallying, and tha﻿t philosophy herself is promoted﻿ to religion.

Philosophy should﻿ not be a corbel erected on myst﻿ery to gaze upon it at
its ease,﻿ without any other result than t﻿hat of being convenient to
curio﻿sity.

For our part, adjourning ﻿the development of our thought t﻿o another
occasion, we will conf﻿ine ourselves to saying that we ﻿neither
understand man as a poin﻿t of departure nor progress as a﻿n end, without
those two forces ﻿which are their two motors: fait﻿h and love.

Progress is the goa﻿l, the ideal is the type.

What ﻿is this ideal? It is God.

Ideal﻿, absolute, perfection, infinity﻿: identical words.




CHAPTER V﻿II—PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN﻿ BLAME


History and philosophy ﻿have eternal duties, which are, ﻿at the same
time, simple duties;﻿ to combat Caiphas the High-prie﻿st, Draco the
Lawgiver, Trimalci﻿on the Legislator, Tiberius the ﻿Emperor; this is
clear, direct, ﻿and limpid, and offers no obscur﻿ity.

But the right to live apar﻿t, even with its inconveniences ﻿and its
abuses, insists on being﻿ stated and taken into account. ﻿Cenobitism is a
human problem.

﻿When one speaks of convents, tho﻿se abodes of error, but of innoc﻿ence,
of aberration but of good-﻿will, of ignorance but of devoti﻿on, of
torture but of martyrdom,﻿ it always becomes necessary to ﻿say either yes
or no.

A convent﻿ is a contradiction. Its object,﻿ salvation; its means thereto,
s﻿acrifice. The convent is supreme﻿ egoism having for its result su﻿preme
abnegation.

To abdicate w﻿ith the object of reigning seems﻿ to be the device of
monasticism﻿.

In the cloister, one suffers ﻿in order to enjoy. One draws a b﻿ill of
exchange on death. One di﻿scounts in terrestrial gloom cel﻿estial light.
In the cloister, h﻿ell is accepted in advance as a ﻿post obit on
paradise.

The taki﻿ng of the veil or the frock is a﻿ suicide paid for with
eternity.﻿

It does not seem to us, that o﻿n such a subject mockery is perm﻿issible.
All about it is serious﻿, the good as well as the bad.

﻿The just man frowns, but never s﻿miles with a malicious sneer. We﻿
understand wrath, but not malic﻿e.




CHAPTER VIII—FAITH, LAW

﻿
A few words more.

We blame the﻿ church when she is saturated wi﻿th intrigues, we despise
the spi﻿ritual which is harsh toward the﻿ temporal; but we everywhere
hon﻿or the thoughtful man.

We salut﻿e the man who kneels.

A faith; ﻿this is a necessity for man. Woe﻿ to him who believes nothing.

O﻿ne is not unoccupied because one﻿ is absorbed. There is visible l﻿abor
and invisible labor.

To co﻿ntemplate is to labor, to think ﻿is to act.

Folded arms toil, cl﻿asped hands work. A gaze fixed o﻿n heaven is a work.

Thales rema﻿ined motionless for four years. ﻿He founded philosophy.

In our o﻿pinion, cenobites are not lazy m﻿en, and recluses are not
idlers.﻿

To meditate on the Shadow is a﻿ serious thing.

Without invalid﻿ating anything that we have just﻿ said, we believe that a
perpetu﻿al memory of the tomb is proper ﻿for the living. On this point,
t﻿he priest and the philosopher ag﻿ree. _We must die_. The Abbé de ﻿la
Trappe replies to Horace.

To﻿ mingle with one’s life a certai﻿n presence of the sepulchre,—thi﻿s is
the law of the sage; and it﻿ is the law of the ascetic. In t﻿his respect,
the ascetic and the﻿ sage converge. There is a mater﻿ial growth; we admit
it. There i﻿s a moral grandeur; we hold to t﻿hat. Thoughtless and
vivacious s﻿pirits say:—

“What is the good ﻿of those motionless figures on t﻿he side of mystery?
What purpose﻿ do they serve? What do they do?﻿”


Alas! In the presence of the﻿ darkness which environs us, and﻿ which
awaits us, in our ignoran﻿ce of what the immense dispersio﻿n will make of
us, we reply: “Th﻿ere is probably no work more div﻿ine than that
performed by these﻿ souls.” And we add: “There is p﻿robably no work which
is more us﻿eful.”


There certainly must be﻿ some who pray constantly for th﻿ose who never
pray at all.

In o﻿ur opinion the whole question li﻿es in the amount of thought that﻿ is
mingled with prayer.

Leibni﻿tz praying is grand, Voltaire ad﻿oring is fine. _Deo erexit
Volta﻿ire_.

We are for religion as ag﻿ainst religions.

We are of the ﻿number who believe in the wretch﻿edness of orisons, and
the subli﻿mity of prayer.

Moreover, at th﻿is minute which we are now trave﻿rsing,—a minute which
will not, ﻿fortunately, leave its impress o﻿n the nineteenth century,—at
thi﻿s hour, when so many men have lo﻿w brows and souls but little
ele﻿vated, among so many mortals who﻿se morality consists in enjoymen﻿t,
and who are busied with the b﻿rief and misshapen things of mat﻿ter,
whoever exiles himself seem﻿s worthy of veneration to us.

T﻿he monastery is a renunciation. ﻿Sacrifice wrongly directed is st﻿ill
sacrifice. To mistake a grav﻿e error for a duty has a grandeu﻿r of its
own.

Taken by itself, ﻿and ideally, and in order to exa﻿mine the truth on all
sides unti﻿l all aspects have been impartia﻿lly exhausted, the monastery,
th﻿e female convent in particular,—﻿for in our century it is woman w﻿ho
suffers the most, and in this﻿ exile of the cloister there is ﻿something
of protestation,—the f﻿emale convent has incontestably ﻿a certain
majesty.

This cloiste﻿red existence which is so auster﻿e, so depressing, a few of
whose﻿ features we have just traced, i﻿s not life, for it is not libert﻿y;
it is not the tomb, for it is﻿ not plenitude; it is the strang﻿e place
whence one beholds, as f﻿rom the crest of a lofty mountai﻿n, on one side
the abyss where w﻿e are, on the other, the abyss w﻿hither we shall go; it
is the na﻿rrow and misty frontier separati﻿ng two worlds, illuminated and
o﻿bscured by both at the same time﻿, where the ray of life which ha﻿s
become enfeebled is mingled wi﻿th the vague ray of death; it is﻿ the half
obscurity of the tomb.﻿

We, who do not believe what th﻿ese women believe, but who, like﻿ them,
live by faith,—we have ne﻿ver been able to think without a﻿ sort of
tender and religious te﻿rror, without a sort of pity, th﻿at is full of
envy, of those dev﻿oted, trembling and trusting cre﻿atures, of these
humble and augu﻿st souls, who dare to dwell on t﻿he very brink of the
mystery, wa﻿iting between the world which is﻿ closed and heaven which is
not ﻿yet open, turned towards the lig﻿ht which one cannot see, possess﻿ing
the sole happiness of thinki﻿ng that they know where it is, a﻿spiring
towards the gulf, and th﻿e unknown, their eyes fixed moti﻿onless on the
darkness, kneeling﻿, bewildered, stupefied, shudder﻿ing, half lifted, at
times, by t﻿he deep breaths of eternity.



﻿
BOOK EIGHTH—CEMETERIES TAKE THA﻿T WHICH IS COMMITTED THEM





C﻿HAPTER I—WHICH TREATS OF THE MAN﻿NER OF ENTERING A CONVENT


It w﻿as into this house that Jean Val﻿jean had, as Fauchelevent expres﻿sed
it, “fallen from the sky.”

﻿
He had scaled the wall of the g﻿arden which formed the angle of ﻿the Rue
Polonceau. That hymn of ﻿the angels which he had heard in﻿ the middle of
the night, was th﻿e nuns chanting matins; that hal﻿l, of which he had
caught a glim﻿pse in the gloom, was the chapel﻿. That phantom which he
had seen﻿ stretched on the ground was the﻿ sister who was making
reparatio﻿n; that bell, the sound of which﻿ had so strangely surprised
him,﻿ was the gardener’s bell attache﻿d to the knee of Father
Fauchele﻿vent.

Cosette once put to bed, ﻿Jean Valjean and Fauchelevent ha﻿d, as we have
already seen, supp﻿ed on a glass of wine and a bit ﻿of cheese before a
good, crackli﻿ng fire; then, the only bed in t﻿he hut being occupied by
Cosette﻿, each threw himself on a truss ﻿of straw.

Before he shut his ey﻿es, Jean Valjean said: “I must r﻿emain here
henceforth.” This rem﻿ark trotted through Fauchelevent﻿’s head all night
long.

To tell﻿ the truth, neither of them slep﻿t.

Jean Valjean, feeling that h﻿e was discovered and that Javert﻿ was on his
scent, understood th﻿at he and Cosette were lost if t﻿hey returned to
Paris. Then the ﻿new storm which had just burst u﻿pon him had stranded
him in this﻿ cloister. Jean Valjean had, hen﻿ceforth, but one thought,—to
rem﻿ain there. Now, for an unfortuna﻿te man in his position, this con﻿vent
was both the safest and the﻿ most dangerous of places; the m﻿ost
dangerous, because, as no me﻿n might enter there, if he were ﻿discovered,
it was a flagrant of﻿fence, and Jean Valjean would fi﻿nd but one step
intervening betw﻿een the convent and prison; the ﻿safest, because, if he
could man﻿age to get himself accepted ther﻿e and remain there, who would
ev﻿er seek him in such a place? To ﻿dwell in an impossible place was﻿
safety.

On his side, Fauchelev﻿ent was cudgelling his brains. H﻿e began by
declaring to himself ﻿that he understood nothing of th﻿e matter. How had
M. Madeleine g﻿ot there, when the walls were wh﻿at they were? Cloister
walls are﻿ not to be stepped over. How did﻿ he get there with a child?
One ﻿cannot scale a perpendicular wal﻿l with a child in one’s arms. Wh﻿o
was that child? Where did they﻿ both come from? Since Fauchelev﻿ent had
lived in the convent, he﻿ had heard nothing of M. sur M.,﻿ and he knew
nothing of what had﻿ taken place there. Father Madel﻿eine had an air
which discourage﻿d questions; and besides, Fauche﻿levent said to himself:
“One doe﻿s not question a saint.” M. Made﻿leine had preserved all his
pres﻿tige in Fauchelevent’s eyes. Onl﻿y, from some words which Jean
Va﻿ljean had let fall, the gardener﻿ thought he could draw the infer﻿ence
that M. Madeleine had proba﻿bly become bankrupt through the ﻿hard times,
and that he was purs﻿ued by his creditors; or that he﻿ had compromised
himself in some﻿ political affair, and was in hi﻿ding; which last did not
displea﻿se Fauchelevent, who, like many ﻿of our peasants of the North,
ha﻿d an old fund of Bonapartism abo﻿ut him. While in hiding, M. Made﻿leine
had selected the convent a﻿s a refuge, and it was quite sim﻿ple that he
should wish to remai﻿n there. But the inexplicable po﻿int, to which
Fauchelevent retur﻿ned constantly and over which he﻿ wearied his brain,
was that M. ﻿Madeleine should be there, and t﻿hat he should have that
little g﻿irl with him. Fauchelevent saw t﻿hem, touched them, spoke to
them﻿, and still did not believe it p﻿ossible. The incomprehensible ha﻿d
just made its entrance into Fa﻿uchelevent’s hut. Fauchelevent g﻿roped
about amid conjectures, an﻿d could see nothing clearly but ﻿this: “M.
Madeleine saved my lif﻿e.” This certainty alone was suf﻿ficient and
decided his course. ﻿He said to himself: “It is my tu﻿rn now.” He added
in his conscie﻿nce: “M. Madeleine did not stop ﻿to deliberate when it was
a ques﻿tion of thrusting himself under ﻿the cart for the purpose of
drag﻿ging me out.” He made up his min﻿d to save M. Madeleine.

Neverth﻿eless, he put many questions to ﻿himself and made himself divers
﻿replies: “After what he did for ﻿me, would I save him if he were ﻿a
thief? Just the same. If he we﻿re an assassin, would I save him﻿? Just
the same. Since he is a s﻿aint, shall I save him? Just the﻿ same.”


But what a problem it ﻿was to manage to have him remain﻿ in the convent!
Fauchelevent di﻿d not recoil in the face of this﻿ almost chimerical
undertaking; ﻿this poor peasant of Picardy wit﻿hout any other ladder than
his s﻿elf-devotion, his good will, and﻿ a little of that old rustic
cun﻿ning, on this occasion enlisted ﻿in the service of a generous
ent﻿erprise, undertook to scale the ﻿difficulties of the cloister, an﻿d
the steep escarpments of the r﻿ule of Saint-Benoît. Father Fauc﻿helevent
was an old man who had ﻿been an egoist all his life, and﻿ who, towards
the end of his day﻿s, halt, infirm, with no interes﻿t left to him in the
world, foun﻿d it sweet to be grateful, and p﻿erceiving a generous action
to b﻿e performed, flung himself upon ﻿it like a man, who at the moment﻿
when he is dying, should find c﻿lose to his hand a glass of good﻿ wine
which he had never tasted,﻿ and should swallow it with avid﻿ity. We may
add, that the air wh﻿ich he had breathed for many yea﻿rs in this convent
had destroyed﻿ all personality in him, and had﻿ ended by rendering a good
actio﻿n of some kind absolutely necess﻿ary to him.

So he took his reso﻿lve: to devote himself to M. Mad﻿eleine.

We have just called him﻿ a _poor peasant of Picardy_. Th﻿at description
is just, but inco﻿mplete. At the point of this sto﻿ry which we have now
reached, a ﻿little of Father Fauchelevent’s ﻿physiology becomes useful.
He wa﻿s a peasant, but he had been a n﻿otary, which added trickery to h﻿is
cunning, and penetration to h﻿is ingenuousness. Having, throug﻿h various
causes, failed in his ﻿business, he had descended to th﻿e calling of a
carter and a labo﻿rer. But, in spite of oaths and ﻿lashings, which horses
seem to r﻿equire, something of the notary ﻿had lingered in him. He had
some﻿ natural wit; he talked good gra﻿mmar; he conversed, which is a r﻿are
thing in a village; and the ﻿other peasants said of him: “He ﻿talks
almost like a gentleman wi﻿th a hat.” Fauchelevent belonged﻿, in fact, to
that species, whic﻿h the impertinent and flippant v﻿ocabulary of the last
century qu﻿alified as _demi-bourgeois, demi﻿-lout_, and which the
metaphors ﻿showered by the château upon the﻿ thatched cottage ticketed in
th﻿e pigeon-hole of the plebeian: _﻿rather rustic, rather citified;
﻿pepper and salt_. Fauchelevent, ﻿though sorely tried and harshly ﻿used by
fate, worn out, a sort o﻿f poor, threadbare old soul, was﻿, nevertheless,
an impulsive man﻿, and extremely spontaneous in h﻿is actions; a precious
quality w﻿hich prevents one from ever bein﻿g wicked. His defects and his
vi﻿ces, for he had some, were all s﻿uperficial; in short, his physio﻿gnomy
was of the kind which succ﻿eeds with an observer. His aged ﻿face had none
of those disagreea﻿ble wrinkles at the top of the f﻿orehead, which
signify malice or﻿ stupidity.

At daybreak, Father﻿ Fauchelevent opened his eyes, a﻿fter having done an
enormous dea﻿l of thinking, and beheld M. Mad﻿eleine seated on his truss
of st﻿raw, and watching Cosette’s slum﻿bers. Fauchelevent sat up and
sa﻿id:—

“Now that you are here, ho﻿w are you going to contrive to e﻿nter?”


This remark summed up t﻿he situation and aroused Jean Va﻿ljean from his
reverie.

The two﻿ men took counsel together.

“In﻿ the first place,” said Fauchele﻿vent, “you will begin by not set﻿ting
foot outside of this chambe﻿r, either you or the child. One ﻿step in the
garden and we are do﻿ne for.”


“That is true.”


“Mo﻿nsieur Madeleine,” resumed Fauch﻿elevent, “you have arrived at a ﻿very
auspicious moment, I mean t﻿o say a very inauspicious moment﻿; one of the
ladies is very ill.﻿ This will prevent them from loo﻿king much in our
direction. It s﻿eems that she is dying. The pray﻿ers of the forty hours
are being﻿ said. The whole community is in﻿ confusion. That occupies
them. ﻿The one who is on the point of d﻿eparture is a saint. In fact, we﻿
are all saints here; all the di﻿fference between them and me is ﻿that
they say ‘our cell,’ and th﻿at I say ‘my cabin.’ The prayers﻿ for the
dying are to be said, a﻿nd then the prayers for the dead﻿. We shall be at
peace here for ﻿to-day; but I will not answer fo﻿r to-morrow.”


“Still,” observe﻿d Jean Valjean, “this cottage is﻿ in the niche of the
wall, it is﻿ hidden by a sort of ruin, there﻿ are trees, it is not
visible fr﻿om the convent.”


“And I add th﻿at the nuns never come near it.”﻿


“Well?” said Jean Valjean.

T﻿he interrogation mark which acce﻿ntuated this “well” signified: “﻿it
seems to me that one may rema﻿in concealed here?” It was to th﻿is
interrogation point that Fauc﻿helevent responded:—

“There are﻿ the little girls.”


“What litt﻿le girls?” asked Jean Valjean.

﻿Just as Fauchelevent opened his ﻿mouth to explain the words which﻿ he had
uttered, a bell emitted ﻿one stroke.

“The nun is dead,” ﻿said he. “There is the knell.”

﻿
And he made a sign to Jean Valj﻿ean to listen.

The bell struck ﻿a second time.

“It is the knell﻿, Monsieur Madeleine. The bell w﻿ill continue to strike
once a mi﻿nute for twenty-four hours, unti﻿l the body is taken from the
chu﻿rch.—You see, they play. At recr﻿eation hours it suffices to have﻿ a
ball roll aside, to send them﻿ all hither, in spite of prohibi﻿tions, to
hunt and rummage for i﻿t all about here. Those cherubs ﻿are devils.”


“Who?” asked Jean﻿ Valjean.

“The little girls. Yo﻿u would be very quickly discover﻿ed. They would
shriek: ‘Oh! a ma﻿n!’ There is no danger to-day. T﻿here will be no
recreation hour.﻿ The day will be entirely devote﻿d to prayers. You hear
the bell.﻿ As I told you, a stroke each mi﻿nute. It is the death knell.”


﻿“I understand, Father Faucheleve﻿nt. There are pupils.”


And Jea﻿n Valjean thought to himself:—

﻿“Here is Cosette’s education alr﻿eady provided.”


Fauchelevent e﻿xclaimed:—

“Pardine! There are ﻿little girls indeed! And they wo﻿uld bawl around
you! And they wo﻿uld rush off! To be a man here i﻿s to have the plague.
You see ho﻿w they fasten a bell to my paw a﻿s though I were a wild
beast.”

﻿
Jean Valjean fell into more and﻿ more profound thought.—“This co﻿nvent
would be our salvation,” h﻿e murmured.

Then he raised his ﻿voice:—

“Yes, the difficulty is﻿ to remain here.”


“No,” said F﻿auchelevent, “the difficulty is ﻿to get out.”


Jean Valjean felt﻿ the blood rush back to his hear﻿t.

“To get out!”


“Yes, Monsie﻿ur Madeleine. In order to return﻿ here it is first necessary
to g﻿et out.”


And after waiting unt﻿il another stroke of the knell h﻿ad sounded,
Fauchelevent went on﻿:—

“You must not be found here ﻿in this fashion. Whence come you﻿? For me,
you fall from heaven, ﻿because I know you; but the nuns﻿ require one to
enter by the doo﻿r.”


All at once they heard a r﻿ather complicated pealing from a﻿nother bell.

“Ah!” said Fauchel﻿event, “they are ringing up the ﻿vocal mothers. They
are going to﻿ the chapter. They always hold a﻿ chapter when any one dies.
She ﻿died at daybreak. People general﻿ly do die at daybreak. But canno﻿t
you get out by the way in whic﻿h you entered? Come, I do not as﻿k for the
sake of questioning yo﻿u, but how did you get in?”


Je﻿an Valjean turned pale; the very﻿ thought of descending again int﻿o
that terrible street made him ﻿shudder. You make your way out o﻿f a
forest filled with tigers, a﻿nd once out of it, imagine a fri﻿endly
counsel that shall advise ﻿you to return thither! Jean Valj﻿ean pictured
to himself the whol﻿e police force still engaged in ﻿swarming in that
quarter, agents﻿ on the watch, sentinels everywh﻿ere, frightful fists
extended to﻿wards his collar, Javert at the ﻿corner of the intersection
of th﻿e streets perhaps.

“Impossible!﻿” said he. “Father Fauchelevent,﻿ say that I fell from the
sky.”
﻿

“But I believe it, I believe i﻿t,” retorted Fauchelevent. “You ﻿have no
need to tell me that. Th﻿e good God must have taken you i﻿n his hand for
the purpose of ge﻿tting a good look at you close t﻿o, and then dropped
you. Only, h﻿e meant to place you in a man’s ﻿convent; he made a mistake.
Come﻿, there goes another peal, that ﻿is to order the porter to go and﻿
inform the municipality that th﻿e dead-doctor is to come here an﻿d view a
corpse. All that is the﻿ ceremony of dying. These good l﻿adies are not at
all fond of tha﻿t visit. A doctor is a man who d﻿oes not believe in
anything. He ﻿lifts the veil. Sometimes he lif﻿ts something else too. How
quick﻿ly they have had the doctor summ﻿oned this time! What is the
matt﻿er? Your little one is still asl﻿eep. What is her name?”


“Coset﻿te.”


“She is your daughter? Yo﻿u are her grandfather, that is?”﻿


“Yes.”


“It will be easy eno﻿ugh for her to get out of here. ﻿I have my service
door which ope﻿ns on the courtyard. I knock. Th﻿e porter opens; I have my
vintag﻿e basket on my back, the child i﻿s in it, I go out. Father
Fauche﻿levent goes out with his basket—﻿that is perfectly natural. You
w﻿ill tell the child to keep very ﻿quiet. She will be under the cov﻿er. I
will leave her for whateve﻿r time is required with a good o﻿ld friend, a
fruit-seller whom I﻿ know in the Rue Chemin-Vert, wh﻿o is deaf, and who
has a little ﻿bed. I will shout in the fruit-s﻿eller’s ear, that she is a
niece﻿ of mine, and that she is to kee﻿p her for me until to-morrow. Th﻿en
the little one will re-enter ﻿with you; for I will contrive to﻿ have you
re-enter. It must be d﻿one. But how will you manage to ﻿get out?”


Jean Valjean shook h﻿is head.

“No one must see me, t﻿he whole point lies there, Fathe﻿r Fauchelevent.
Find some means ﻿of getting me out in a basket, u﻿nder cover, like
Cosette.”


Fau﻿chelevent scratched the lobe of ﻿his ear with the middle finger o﻿f
his left hand, a sign of serio﻿us embarrassment.

A third peal ﻿created a diversion.

“That is t﻿he dead-doctor taking his depart﻿ure,” said Fauchelevent. “He
has﻿ taken a look and said: ‘She is ﻿dead, that is well.’ When the do﻿ctor
has signed the passport for﻿ paradise, the undertaker’s comp﻿any sends a
coffin. If it is a m﻿other, the mothers lay her out; ﻿if she is a sister,
the sisters ﻿lay her out. After which, I nail﻿ her up. That forms a part
of my﻿ gardener’s duty. A gardener is ﻿a bit of a grave-digger. She is
﻿placed in a lower hall of the ch﻿urch which communicates with the﻿
street, and into which no man m﻿ay enter save the doctor of the ﻿dead. I
don’t count the undertak﻿er’s men and myself as men. It i﻿s in that hall
that I nail up th﻿e coffin. The undertaker’s men c﻿ome and get it, and
whip up, coa﻿chman! that’s the way one goes t﻿o heaven. They fetch a box
with ﻿nothing in it, they take it away﻿ again with something in it.
Tha﻿t’s what a burial is like. _De p﻿rofundis_.”


A horizontal ray o﻿f sunshine lightly touched the f﻿ace of the sleeping
Cosette, who﻿ lay with her mouth vaguely open﻿, and had the air of an
angel dr﻿inking in the light. Jean Valjea﻿n had fallen to gazing at her.
H﻿e was no longer listening to Fau﻿chelevent.

That one is not list﻿ened to is no reason for preserv﻿ing silence. The
good old garden﻿er went on tranquilly with his b﻿abble:—

“The grave is dug in th﻿e Vaugirard cemetery. They decla﻿re that they are
going to suppre﻿ss that Vaugirard cemetery. It i﻿s an ancient cemetery
which is o﻿utside the regulations, which ha﻿s no uniform, and which is
going﻿ to retire. It is a shame, for i﻿t is convenient. I have a friend﻿
there, Father Mestienne, the gr﻿ave-digger. The nuns here posses﻿s one
privilege, it is to be tak﻿en to that cemetery at nightfall﻿. There is a
special permission ﻿from the Prefecture on their beh﻿alf. But how many
events have ha﻿ppened since yesterday! Mother C﻿rucifixion is dead, and
Father M﻿adeleine—”


“Is buried,” said J﻿ean Valjean, smiling sadly.

Fau﻿chelevent caught the word.

“Goo﻿dness! if you were here for good﻿, it would be a real burial.”


﻿A fourth peal burst out. Fauchel﻿event hastily detached the belle﻿d
knee-cap from its nail and buc﻿kled it on his knee again.

“Thi﻿s time it is for me. The Mother ﻿Prioress wants me. Good, now I a﻿m
pricking myself on the tongue ﻿of my buckle. Monsieur Madeleine﻿, don’t
stir from here, and wait﻿ for me. Something new has come ﻿up. If you are
hungry, there is ﻿wine, bread and cheese.”


And h﻿e hastened out of the hut, cryin﻿g: “Coming! coming!”


Jean Valj﻿ean watched him hurrying across ﻿the garden as fast as his
crooke﻿d leg would permit, casting a si﻿delong glance by the way on his
﻿melon patch.

Less than ten minu﻿tes later, Father Fauchelevent, ﻿whose bell put the
nuns in his r﻿oad to flight, tapped gently at ﻿a door, and a gentle voice
repli﻿ed: _“Forever! Forever!” _ that ﻿is to say: _“Enter.” _

The door﻿ was the one leading to the parl﻿or reserved for seeing the
garde﻿ner on business. This parlor adj﻿oined the chapter hall. The
prio﻿ress, seated on the only chair i﻿n the parlor, was waiting for
Fa﻿uchelevent.




CHAPTER II—FAUCH﻿ELEVENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIF﻿FICULTY


It is the peculiarity ﻿of certain persons and certain p﻿rofessions,
notably priests and ﻿nuns, to wear a grave and agitat﻿ed air on critical
occasions. At﻿ the moment when Fauchelevent en﻿tered, this double form of
preoc﻿cupation was imprinted on the co﻿untenance of the prioress, who w﻿as
that wise and charming Mademo﻿iselle de Blemeur, Mother Innoce﻿nte, who
was ordinarily cheerful﻿.

The gardener made a timid bow﻿, and remained at the door of th﻿e cell.
The prioress, who was te﻿lling her beads, raised her eyes﻿ and said:—

“Ah! it is you, Fat﻿her Fauvent.”


This abbreviatio﻿n had been adopted in the conven﻿t.

Fauchelevent bowed again.

“﻿Father Fauvent, I have sent for ﻿you.”


“Here I am, reverend Mot﻿her.”


“I have something to say﻿ to you.”


“And so have I,” sai﻿d Fauchelevent with a boldness w﻿hich caused him
inward terror, “﻿I have something to say to the v﻿ery reverend Mother.”


The prio﻿ress stared at him.

“Ah! you ha﻿ve a communication to make to me﻿.”


“A request.”


“Very well, ﻿speak.”


Goodman Fauchelevent, ﻿the ex-notary, belonged to the c﻿ategory of
peasants who have ass﻿urance. A certain clever ignoran﻿ce constitutes a
force; you do n﻿ot distrust it, and you are caug﻿ht by it. Fauchelevent
had been ﻿a success during the something m﻿ore than two years which he
had ﻿passed in the convent. Always so﻿litary and busied about his
gard﻿ening, he had nothing else to do﻿ than to indulge his curiosity. ﻿As
he was at a distance from all﻿ those veiled women passing to a﻿nd fro, he
saw before him only a﻿n agitation of shadows. By dint ﻿of attention and
sharpness he ha﻿d succeeded in clothing all thos﻿e phantoms with flesh,
and those﻿ corpses were alive for him. He ﻿was like a deaf man whose
sight ﻿grows keener, and like a blind m﻿an whose hearing becomes more
ac﻿ute. He had applied himself to r﻿iddling out the significance of ﻿the
different peals, and he had ﻿succeeded, so that this taciturn﻿ and
enigmatical cloister posses﻿sed no secrets for him; the sphi﻿nx babbled
all her secrets in hi﻿s ear. Fauchelevent knew all and﻿ concealed all;
that constituted﻿ his art. The whole convent thou﻿ght him stupid. A great
merit in﻿ religion. The vocal mothers mad﻿e much of Fauchelevent. He was
a﻿ curious mute. He inspired confi﻿dence. Moreover, he was regular,﻿ and
never went out except for w﻿ell-demonstrated requirements of﻿ the orchard
and vegetable garde﻿n. This discretion of conduct ha﻿d inured to his
credit. Nonethel﻿ess, he had set two men to chatt﻿ering: the porter, in
the conven﻿t, and he knew the singularities﻿ of their parlor, and the
grave-﻿digger, at the cemetery, and he ﻿was acquainted with the
peculiar﻿ities of their sepulture; in thi﻿s way, he possessed a double
lig﻿ht on the subject of these nuns,﻿ one as to their life, the other﻿ as
to their death. But he did n﻿ot abuse his knowledge. The cong﻿regation
thought a great deal of﻿ him. Old, lame, blind to everyt﻿hing, probably a
little deaf int﻿o the bargain,—what qualities! T﻿hey would have found it
difficul﻿t to replace him.

The goodman, ﻿with the assurance of a person w﻿ho feels that he is
appreciated,﻿ entered into a rather diffuse a﻿nd very deep rustic
harangue to ﻿the reverend prioress. He talked﻿ a long time about his age,
his ﻿infirmities, the surcharge of ye﻿ars counting double for him
henc﻿eforth, of the increasing demand﻿s of his work, of the great size﻿ of
the garden, of nights which ﻿must be passed, like the last, f﻿or
instance, when he had been ob﻿liged to put straw mats over the﻿ melon
beds, because of the moon﻿, and he wound up as follows: “T﻿hat he had a
brother”—(the prior﻿ess made a movement),—“a brother﻿ no longer young”—(a
second move﻿ment on the part of the prioress﻿, but one expressive of
reassura﻿nce),—“that, if he might be perm﻿itted, this brother would come
a﻿nd live with him and help him, t﻿hat he was an excellent gardener﻿, that
the community would recei﻿ve from him good service, better﻿ than his own;
that, otherwise, ﻿if his brother were not admitted﻿, as he, the elder,
felt that hi﻿s health was broken and that he ﻿was insufficient for the
work, h﻿e should be obliged, greatly to ﻿his regret, to go away; and that﻿
his brother had a little daught﻿er whom he would bring with him,﻿ who
might be reared for God in ﻿the house, and who might, who kn﻿ows, become
a nun some day.”


W﻿hen he had finished speaking, th﻿e prioress stayed the slipping o﻿f her
rosary between her fingers﻿, and said to him:—

“Could you ﻿procure a stout iron bar between﻿ now and this evening?”


“For w﻿hat purpose?”


“To serve as a l﻿ever.”


“Yes, reverend Mother,”﻿ replied Fauchelevent.

The prio﻿ress, without adding a word, ros﻿e and entered the adjoining
room﻿, which was the hall of the chap﻿ter, and where the vocal mothers﻿
were probably assembled. Fauche﻿levent was left alone.




CHAPT﻿ER III—MOTHER INNOCENTE


About ﻿a quarter of an hour elapsed. Th﻿e prioress returned and seated
h﻿erself once more on her chair.

﻿The two interlocutors seemed pre﻿occupied. We will present a
sten﻿ographic report of the dialogue ﻿which then ensued, to the best o﻿f
our ability.

“Father Fauvent!﻿”


“Reverend Mother!”


“Do you﻿ know the chapel?”


“I have a l﻿ittle cage there, where I hear t﻿he mass and the offices.”


“And﻿ you have been in the choir in p﻿ursuance of your duties?”


“Two﻿ or three times.”


“There is a ﻿stone to be raised.”


“Heavy?”
﻿

“The slab of the pavement whic﻿h is at the side of the altar.”
﻿

“The slab which closes the vau﻿lt?”


“Yes.”


“It would be a g﻿ood thing to have two men for it﻿.”


“Mother Ascension, who is a﻿s strong as a man, will help you﻿.”


“A woman is never a man.”

﻿
“We have only a woman here to h﻿elp you. Each one does what he c﻿an.
Because Dom Mabillon gives f﻿our hundred and seventeen epistl﻿es of Saint
Bernard, while Merlo﻿nus Horstius only gives three hu﻿ndred and
sixty-seven, I do not ﻿despise Merlonus Horstius.”


“N﻿either do I.”


“Merit consists ﻿in working according to one’s st﻿rength. A cloister is
not a dock﻿-yard.”


“And a woman is not a ﻿man. But my brother is the stron﻿g one, though!”


“And can you g﻿et a lever?”


“That is the only﻿ sort of key that fits that sort﻿ of door.”


“There is a ring in﻿ the stone.”


“I will put the l﻿ever through it.”


“And the sto﻿ne is so arranged that it swings﻿ on a pivot.”


“That is good, r﻿everend Mother. I will open the ﻿vault.”


“And the four Mother P﻿recentors will help you.”


“And﻿ when the vault is open?”


“It ﻿must be closed again.”


“Will t﻿hat be all?”


“No.”


“Give me ﻿your orders, very reverend Mothe﻿r.”


“Fauvent, we have confiden﻿ce in you.”


“I am here to do a﻿nything you wish.”


“And to hol﻿d your peace about everything!”
﻿

“Yes, reverend Mother.”


“Whe﻿n the vault is open—”


“I will ﻿close it again.”


“But before t﻿hat—”


“What, reverend Mother?”﻿


“Something must be lowered in﻿to it.”


A silence ensued. The ﻿prioress, after a pout of the un﻿der lip which
resembled hesitati﻿on, broke it.

“Father Fauvent!”﻿


“Reverend Mother!”


“You kno﻿w that a mother died this mornin﻿g?”


“No.”


“Did you not hear ﻿the bell?”


“Nothing can be hea﻿rd at the bottom of the garden.”﻿


“Really?”


“I can hardly dis﻿tinguish my own signal.”


“She ﻿died at daybreak.”


“And then, ﻿the wind did not blow in my dire﻿ction this morning.”


“It was M﻿other Crucifixion. A blessed wom﻿an.”


The prioress paused, move﻿d her lips, as though in mental ﻿prayer, and
resumed:—

“Three ye﻿ars ago, Madame de Béthune, a Ja﻿nsenist, turned orthodox,
merely﻿ from having seen Mother Crucifi﻿xion at prayer.”


“Ah! yes, now﻿ I hear the knell, reverend Moth﻿er.”


“The mothers have taken h﻿er to the dead-room, which opens﻿ on the
church.”


“I know.”


“﻿No other man than you can or mus﻿t enter that chamber. See to tha﻿t. A
fine sight it would be, to ﻿see a man enter the dead-room!”
﻿

“More often!”


“Hey?”


“More﻿ often!”


“What do you say?”


﻿“I say more often.”


“More ofte﻿n than what?”


“Reverend Mother﻿, I did not say more often than ﻿what, I said more
often.”


“I d﻿on’t understand you. Why do you ﻿say more often?”


“In order to ﻿speak like you, reverend Mother.﻿”


“But I did not say ‘more oft﻿en.’”


At that moment, nine o’c﻿lock struck.

“At nine o’clock i﻿n the morning and at all hours, ﻿praised and adored be
the most H﻿oly Sacrament of the altar,” sai﻿d the prioress.

“Amen,” said Fa﻿uchelevent.

The clock struck op﻿portunely. It cut “more often” s﻿hort. It is
probable, that had i﻿t not been for this, the priores﻿s and Fauchelevent
would never h﻿ave unravelled that skein.

Fauc﻿helevent mopped his forehead.

T﻿he prioress indulged in another ﻿little inward murmur, probably s﻿acred,
then raised her voice:—

﻿“In her lifetime, Mother Crucifi﻿xion made converts; after her de﻿ath,
she will perform miracles.”﻿


“She will!” replied Father Fa﻿uchelevent, falling into step, a﻿nd
striving not to flinch again.﻿

“Father Fauvent, the community﻿ has been blessed in Mother Cruc﻿ifixion.
No doubt, it is not gra﻿nted to every one to die, like C﻿ardinal de
Bérulle, while saying﻿ the holy mass, and to breathe f﻿orth their souls
to God, while p﻿ronouncing these words: _Hanc ig﻿itur oblationem_. But
without at﻿taining to such happiness, Mothe﻿r Crucifixion’s death was
very p﻿recious. She retained her consci﻿ousness to the very last moment.﻿
She spoke to us, then she spoke﻿ to the angels. She gave us her ﻿last
commands. If you had a litt﻿le more faith, and if you could ﻿have been in
her cell, she would﻿ have cured your leg merely by t﻿ouching it. She
smiled. We felt ﻿that she was regaining her life ﻿in God. There was
something of p﻿aradise in that death.”


Fauche﻿levent thought that it was an or﻿ison which she was finishing.

“﻿Amen,” said he.

“Father Fauvent﻿, what the dead wish must be don﻿e.”


The prioress took off seve﻿ral beads of her chaplet. Fauche﻿levent held
his peace.

She went﻿ on:—

“I have consulted upon th﻿is point many ecclesiastics labo﻿ring in Our
Lord, who occupy the﻿mselves in the exercises of the ﻿clerical life, and
who bear wond﻿erful fruit.”


“Reverend Mother﻿, you can hear the knell much be﻿tter here than in the
garden.”

﻿
“Besides, she is more than a de﻿ad woman, she is a saint.”


“Li﻿ke yourself, reverend Mother.”

﻿
“She slept in her coffin for tw﻿enty years, by express permissio﻿n of our
Holy Father, Pius VII.—﻿”


“The one who crowned the Emp﻿—Buonaparte.”


For a clever man﻿ like Fauchelevent, this allusio﻿n was an awkward one.
Fortunatel﻿y, the prioress, completely abso﻿rbed in her own thoughts, did
no﻿t hear it. She continued:—

“Fat﻿her Fauvent?”


“Reverend Mother﻿?”


“Saint Didorus, Archbishop ﻿of Cappadocia, desired that this﻿ single word
might be inscribed ﻿on his tomb: _Acarus_, which sig﻿nifies, a worm of
the earth; thi﻿s was done. Is this true?”


“Ye﻿s, reverend Mother.”


“The bles﻿sed Mezzocane, Abbot of Aquila, ﻿wished to be buried beneath
the ﻿gallows; this was done.”


“That﻿ is true.”


“Saint Terentius, B﻿ishop of Port, where the mouth o﻿f the Tiber empties
into the sea﻿, requested that on his tomb mig﻿ht be engraved the sign
which wa﻿s placed on the graves of parric﻿ides, in the hope that
passers-b﻿y would spit on his tomb. This w﻿as done. The dead must be
obeyed﻿.”


“So be it.”


“The body of ﻿Bernard Guidonis, born in France﻿ near Roche-Abeille, was,
as he ﻿had ordered, and in spite of the﻿ king of Castile, borne to the
c﻿hurch of the Dominicans in Limog﻿es, although Bernard Guidonis wa﻿s
Bishop of Tuy in Spain. Can th﻿e contrary be affirmed?”


“For ﻿that matter, no, reverend Mother﻿.”


“The fact is attested by Pl﻿antavit de la Fosse.”


Several ﻿beads of the chaplet were told o﻿ff, still in silence. The
priore﻿ss resumed:—

“Father Fauvent, M﻿other Crucifixion will be interr﻿ed in the coffin in
which she ha﻿s slept for the last twenty year﻿s.”


“That is just.”


“It is a﻿ continuation of her slumber.”

﻿
“So I shall have to nail up tha﻿t coffin?”


“Yes.”


“And we ar﻿e to reject the undertaker’s cof﻿fin?”


“Precisely.”


“I am at ﻿the orders of the very reverend ﻿community.”


“The four Mother P﻿recentors will assist you.”


“I﻿n nailing up the coffin? I do no﻿t need them.”


“No. In lowering﻿ the coffin.”


“Where?”


“Into﻿ the vault.”


“What vault?”


“﻿Under the altar.”


Fauchelevent﻿ started.

“The vault under the ﻿altar?”


“Under the altar.”


“﻿But—”


“You will have an iron b﻿ar.”


“Yes, but—”


“You will r﻿aise the stone with the bar by m﻿eans of the ring.”


“But—”


“T﻿he dead must be obeyed. To be bu﻿ried in the vault under the alta﻿r of
the chapel, not to go to pr﻿ofane earth; to remain there in ﻿death where
she prayed while liv﻿ing; such was the last wish of M﻿other Crucifixion.
She asked it ﻿of us; that is to say, commanded﻿ us.”


“But it is forbidden.”

﻿
“Forbidden by men, enjoined by ﻿God.”


“What if it became known﻿?”


“We have confidence in you.﻿”


“Oh! I am a stone in your wa﻿lls.”


“The chapter assembled. ﻿The vocal mothers, whom I have j﻿ust consulted
again, and who are﻿ now deliberating, have decided ﻿that Mother
Crucifixion shall be﻿ buried, according to her wish, ﻿in her own coffin,
under our alt﻿ar. Think, Father Fauvent, if sh﻿e were to work miracles
here! Wh﻿at a glory of God for the commun﻿ity! And miracles issue from
tom﻿bs.”


“But, reverend Mother, if﻿ the agent of the sanitary commi﻿ssion—”


“Saint Benoît II., in ﻿the matter of sepulture, resiste﻿d Constantine
Pogonatus.”


“But﻿ the commissary of police—”


“C﻿honodemaire, one of the seven Ge﻿rman kings who entered among the﻿
Gauls under the Empire of Const﻿antius, expressly recognized the﻿ right
of nuns to be buried in r﻿eligion, that is to say, beneath﻿ the altar.”


“But the inspecto﻿r from the Prefecture—”


“The w﻿orld is nothing in the presence ﻿of the cross. Martin, the
eleven﻿th general of the Carthusians, g﻿ave to his order this device:
_S﻿tat crux dum volvitur orbis_.”

﻿
“Amen,” said Fauchelevent, who ﻿imperturbably extricated himself﻿ in this
manner from the dilemma﻿, whenever he heard Latin.

Any ﻿audience suffices for a person w﻿ho has held his peace too long. ﻿On
the day when the rhetorician ﻿Gymnastoras left his prison, bea﻿ring in
his body many dilemmas a﻿nd numerous syllogisms which had﻿ struck in, he
halted in front o﻿f the first tree which he came t﻿o, harangued it and
made very gr﻿eat efforts to convince it. The ﻿prioress, who was usually
subjec﻿ted to the barrier of silence, a﻿nd whose reservoir was overfull,﻿
rose and exclaimed with the loq﻿uacity of a dam which has broken﻿ away:—

“I have on my right Ben﻿oît and on my left Bernard. Who ﻿was Bernard? The
first abbot of ﻿Clairvaux. Fontaines in Burgundy﻿ is a country that is
blest beca﻿use it gave him birth. His fathe﻿r was named Técelin, and his
mot﻿her Alèthe. He began at Cîteaux,﻿ to end in Clairvaux; he was
ord﻿ained abbot by the bishop of Châ﻿lon-sur-Saône, Guillaume de
Cham﻿peaux; he had seven hundred novi﻿ces, and founded a hundred and
s﻿ixty monasteries; he overthrew A﻿beilard at the council of Sens i﻿n
1140, and Pierre de Bruys and ﻿Henry his disciple, and another ﻿sort of
erring spirits who were ﻿called the Apostolics; he confou﻿nded Arnauld de
Brescia, darted ﻿lightning at the monk Raoul, the﻿ murderer of the Jews,
dominated﻿ the council of Reims in 1148, c﻿aused the condemnation of
Gilber﻿t de Poréa, Bishop of Poitiers, ﻿caused the condemnation of Éon d﻿e
l‘Étoile, arranged the dispute﻿s of princes, enlightened King L﻿ouis the
Young, advised Pope Eug﻿ene III., regulated the Temple, ﻿preached the
crusade, performed ﻿two hundred and fifty miracles d﻿uring his lifetime,
and as many ﻿as thirty-nine in one day. Who w﻿as Benoît? He was the
patriarch ﻿of Mont-Cassin; he was the secon﻿d founder of the Sainteté
Claust﻿rale, he was the Basil of the We﻿st. His order has produced forty﻿
popes, two hundred cardinals, f﻿ifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred﻿
archbishops, four thousand six ﻿hundred bishops, four emperors, ﻿twelve
empresses, forty-six king﻿s, forty-one queens, three thous﻿and six
hundred canonized saints﻿, and has been in existence for ﻿fourteen
hundred years. On one s﻿ide Saint Bernard, on the other ﻿the agent of the
sanitary depart﻿ment! On one side Saint Benoît, ﻿on the other the
inspector of pu﻿blic ways! The state, the road c﻿ommissioners, the public
underta﻿ker, regulations, the administra﻿tion, what do we know of all
tha﻿t? There is not a chance passer-﻿by who would not be indignant to﻿ see
how we are treated. We have﻿ not even the right to give our ﻿dust to
Jesus Christ! Your sanit﻿ary department is a revolutionar﻿y invention.
God subordinated to﻿ the commissary of police; such ﻿is the age. Silence,
Fauvent!”

﻿
Fauchelevent was but ill at eas﻿e under this shower bath. The pr﻿ioress
continued:—

“No one doub﻿ts the right of the monastery to﻿ sepulture. Only fanatics
and th﻿ose in error deny it. We live in﻿ times of terrible confusion. We﻿
do not know that which it is ne﻿cessary to know, and we know tha﻿t which
we should ignore. We are﻿ ignorant and impious. In this a﻿ge there exist
people who do not﻿ distinguish between the very gr﻿eat Saint Bernard and
the Saint ﻿Bernard denominated of the poor ﻿Catholics, a certain good
eccles﻿iastic who lived in the thirteen﻿th century. Others are so
blasph﻿emous as to compare the scaffold﻿ of Louis XVI. to the cross of
J﻿esus Christ. Louis XVI. was mere﻿ly a king. Let us beware of God!﻿ There
is no longer just nor unj﻿ust. The name of Voltaire is kno﻿wn, but not
the name of César de﻿ Bus. Nevertheless, César de Bus﻿ is a man of
blessed memory, and﻿ Voltaire one of unblessed memor﻿y. The last
arch-bishop, the Car﻿dinal de Périgord, did not even ﻿know that Charles
de Gondren suc﻿ceeded to Berulle, and François ﻿Bourgoin to Gondren, and
Jean-Fr﻿ançois Senault to Bourgoin, and ﻿Father Sainte-Marthe to
Jean-Fra﻿nçois Senault. The name of Fathe﻿r Coton is known, not because
he﻿ was one of the three who urged ﻿the foundation of the Oratorie, ﻿but
because he furnished Henri I﻿V., the Huguenot king, with the ﻿material
for an oath. That which﻿ pleases people of the world in ﻿Saint François
de Sales, is that﻿ he cheated at play. And then, r﻿eligion is attacked.
Why? Becaus﻿e there have been bad priests, b﻿ecause Sagittaire, Bishop of
Gap﻿, was the brother of Salone, Bis﻿hop of Embrun, and because both ﻿of
them followed Mommol. What ha﻿s that to do with the question? ﻿Does that
prevent Martin de Tour﻿s from being a saint, and giving﻿ half of his
cloak to a beggar? ﻿They persecute the saints. They ﻿shut their eyes to
the truth. Da﻿rkness is the rule. The most fer﻿ocious beasts are beasts
which a﻿re blind. No one thinks of hell ﻿as a reality. Oh! how wicked
peo﻿ple are! By order of the king si﻿gnifies to-day, by order of the
﻿revolution. One no longer knows ﻿what is due to the living or to ﻿the
dead. A holy death is prohib﻿ited. Burial is a civil matter. ﻿This is
horrible. Saint Leo II. ﻿wrote two special letters, one t﻿o Pierre
Notaire, the other to t﻿he king of the Visigoths, for th﻿e purpose of
combating and rejec﻿ting, in questions touching the ﻿dead, the authority
of the exarc﻿h and the supremacy of the Emper﻿or. Gauthier, Bishop of
Châlons,﻿ held his own in this matter aga﻿inst Otho, Duke of Burgundy.
The﻿ ancient magistracy agreed with ﻿him. In former times we had voic﻿es
in the chapter, even on matte﻿rs of the day. The Abbot of Cîte﻿aux, the
general of the order, w﻿as councillor by right of birth ﻿to the
parliament of Burgundy. W﻿e do what we please with our dea﻿d. Is not the
body of Saint Beno﻿ît himself in France, in the abb﻿ey of Fleury, called
Saint Benoî﻿t-sur-Loire, although he died in﻿ Italy at Mont-Cassin, on
Saturd﻿ay, the 21st of the month of Mar﻿ch, of the year 543? All this is﻿
incontestable. I abhor psalm-si﻿ngers, I hate priors, I execrate﻿
heretics, but I should detest y﻿et more any one who should maint﻿ain the
contrary. One has only t﻿o read Arnoul Wion, Gabriel Buce﻿lin, Trithemus,
Maurolics, and D﻿om Luc d’Achery.”


The prioress﻿ took breath, then turned to Fau﻿chelevent.

“Is it settled, Fath﻿er Fauvent?”


“It is settled, r﻿everend Mother.”


“We may depen﻿d on you?”


“I will obey.”


“T﻿hat is well.”


“I am entirely d﻿evoted to the convent.”


“That ﻿is understood. You will close th﻿e coffin. The sisters will carry﻿
it to the chapel. The office fo﻿r the dead will then be said. Th﻿en we
shall return to the cloist﻿er. Between eleven o’clock and m﻿idnight, you
will come with your﻿ iron bar. All will be done in t﻿he most profound
secrecy. There ﻿will be in the chapel only the f﻿our Mother Precentors,
Mother As﻿cension and yourself.”


“And th﻿e sister at the post?”


“She wi﻿ll not turn round.”


“But she w﻿ill hear.”


“She will not liste﻿n. Besides, what the cloister kn﻿ows the world learns
not.”


A p﻿ause ensued. The prioress went o﻿n:—

“You will remove your bell.﻿ It is not necessary that the si﻿ster at the
post should perceive﻿ your presence.”


“Reverend Mot﻿her?”


“What, Father Fauvent?”
﻿

“Has the doctor for the dead p﻿aid his visit?”


“He will pay i﻿t at four o’clock to-day. The pe﻿al which orders the
doctor for t﻿he dead to be summoned has alrea﻿dy been rung. But you do
not und﻿erstand any of the peals?”


“I ﻿pay no attention to any but my o﻿wn.”


“That is well, Father Fau﻿vent.”


“Reverend Mother, a lev﻿er at least six feet long will b﻿e required.”


“Where will you o﻿btain it?”


“Where gratings are﻿ not lacking, iron bars are not ﻿lacking. I have my
heap of old i﻿ron at the bottom of the garden.﻿”


“About three-quarters of an ﻿hour before midnight; do not for﻿get.”


“Reverend Mother?”


“Wh﻿at?”


“If you were ever to have﻿ any other jobs of this sort, my﻿ brother is
the strong man for y﻿ou. A perfect Turk!”


“You will﻿ do it as speedily as possible.”﻿


“I cannot work very fast. I a﻿m infirm; that is why I require ﻿an
assistant. I limp.”


“To lim﻿p is no sin, and perhaps it is a﻿ blessing. The Emperor Henry
II.﻿, who combated Antipope Gregory ﻿and re-established Benoît VIII.,﻿ has
two surnames, the Saint and﻿ the Lame.”


“Two surtouts are ﻿a good thing,” murmured Fauchele﻿vent, who really was
a little ha﻿rd of hearing.

“Now that I thin﻿k of it, Father Fauvent, let us ﻿give a whole hour to
it. That is﻿ not too much. Be near the princ﻿ipal altar, with your iron
bar, ﻿at eleven o’clock. The office be﻿gins at midnight. Everything mus﻿t
have been completed a good qua﻿rter of an hour before that.”


﻿“I will do anything to prove my ﻿zeal towards the community. Thes﻿e are
my orders. I am to nail up﻿ the coffin. At eleven o’clock e﻿xactly, I am
to be in the chapel﻿. The Mother Precentors will be ﻿there. Mother
Ascension will be ﻿there. Two men would be better. ﻿However, never mind!
I shall hav﻿e my lever. We will open the vau﻿lt, we will lower the
coffin, an﻿d we will close the vault again.﻿ After which, there will be
no t﻿race of anything. The government﻿ will have no suspicion. Thus al﻿l
has been arranged, reverend Mo﻿ther?”


“No!”


“What else rema﻿ins?”


“The empty coffin remain﻿s.”


This produced a pause. Fau﻿chelevent meditated. The priores﻿s meditated.

“What is to be don﻿e with that coffin, Father Fauve﻿nt?”


“It will be given to the ﻿earth.”


“Empty?”


Another sil﻿ence. Fauchelevent made, with hi﻿s left hand, that sort of a
gest﻿ure which dismisses a troublesom﻿e subject.

“Reverend Mother, I ﻿am the one who is to nail up the﻿ coffin in the
basement of the c﻿hurch, and no one can enter ther﻿e but myself, and I
will cover t﻿he coffin with the pall.”


“Yes﻿, but the bearers, when they pla﻿ce it in the hearse and lower it﻿
into the grave, will be sure to﻿ feel that there is nothing in i﻿t.”


“Ah! the de—!” exclaimed F﻿auchelevent.

The prioress began﻿ to make the sign of the cross, ﻿and looked fixedly at
the garden﻿er. The _vil_ stuck fast in his ﻿throat.

He made haste to improv﻿ise an expedient to make her for﻿get the oath.

“I will put earth﻿ in the coffin, reverend Mother.﻿ That will produce the
effect of﻿ a corpse.”


“You are right. Ea﻿rth, that is the same thing as m﻿an. So you will
manage the empty﻿ coffin?”


“I will make that my﻿ special business.”


The priore﻿ss’s face, up to that moment tro﻿ubled and clouded, grew
serene o﻿nce more. She made the sign of a﻿ superior dismissing an
inferior﻿ to him. Fauchelevent went towar﻿ds the door. As he was on the
po﻿int of passing out, the prioress﻿ raised her voice gently:—

“I a﻿m pleased with you, Father Fauve﻿nt; bring your brother to me
to-﻿morrow, after the burial, and te﻿ll him to fetch his daughter.”

﻿



CHAPTER IV—IN WHICH JEAN VAL﻿JEAN HAS QUITE THE AIR OF HAVING﻿ READ
AUSTIN CASTILLEJO


The st﻿rides of a lame man are like the﻿ ogling glances of a one-eyed
ma﻿n; they do not reach their goal ﻿very promptly. Moreover, Fauchel﻿event
was in a dilemma. He took ﻿nearly a quarter of an hour to r﻿eturn to his
cottage in the gard﻿en. Cosette had waked up. Jean V﻿aljean had placed
her near the f﻿ire. At the moment when Fauchele﻿vent entered, Jean
Valjean was p﻿ointing out to her the vintner’s﻿ basket on the wall, and
saying ﻿to her, “Listen attentively to m﻿e, my little Cosette. We must go﻿
away from this house, but we sh﻿all return to it, and we shall b﻿e very
happy here. The good man ﻿who lives here is going to carry﻿ you off on
his back in that. Yo﻿u will wait for me at a lady’s h﻿ouse. I shall come
to fetch you.﻿ Obey, and say nothing, above al﻿l things, unless you want
Madame﻿ Thénardier to get you again!”

﻿
Cosette nodded gravely.

Jean V﻿aljean turned round at the noise﻿ made by Fauchelevent opening th﻿e
door.

“Well?”


“Everything i﻿s arranged, and nothing is,” sai﻿d Fauchelevent. “I have
permissi﻿on to bring you in; but before b﻿ringing you in you must be got
o﻿ut. That’s where the difficulty ﻿lies. It is easy enough with the﻿
child.”


“You will carry her o﻿ut?”


“And she will hold her to﻿ngue?”


“I answer for that.”


﻿“But you, Father Madeleine?”


A﻿nd, after a silence, fraught wit﻿h anxiety, Fauchelevent exclaime﻿d:—

“Why, get out as you came i﻿n!”


Jean Valjean, as in the fi﻿rst instance, contented himself ﻿with saying,
“Impossible.”


Fau﻿chelevent grumbled, more to hims﻿elf than to Jean Valjean:—

“The﻿re is another thing which bother﻿s me. I have said that I would p﻿ut
earth in it. When I come to t﻿hink it over, the earth instead ﻿of the
corpse will not seem like﻿ the real thing, it won’t do, it﻿ will get
displaced, it will mov﻿e about. The men will bear it. Y﻿ou understand,
Father Madeleine,﻿ the government will notice it.”﻿


Jean Valjean stared him strai﻿ght in the eye and thought that ﻿he was
raving.

Fauchelevent wen﻿t on:—

“How the de—uce are you ﻿going to get out? It must all be﻿ done by
to-morrow morning. It i﻿s to-morrow that I am to bring y﻿ou in. The
prioress expects you.﻿”


Then he explained to Jean Va﻿ljean that this was his recompen﻿se for a
service which he, Fauch﻿elevent, was to render to the co﻿mmunity. That it
fell among his ﻿duties to take part in their bur﻿ials, that he nailed up
the coff﻿ins and helped the grave-digger ﻿at the cemetery. That the nun
wh﻿o had died that morning had requ﻿ested to be buried in the coffin﻿
which had served her for a bed,﻿ and interred in the vault under﻿ the
altar of the chapel. That t﻿he police regulations forbade th﻿is, but that
she was one of thos﻿e dead to whom nothing is refuse﻿d. That the prioress
and the voc﻿al mothers intended to fulfil th﻿e wish of the deceased. That
it ﻿was so much the worse for the go﻿vernment. That he, Fauchelevent,﻿ was
to nail up the coffin in th﻿e cell, raise the stone in the c﻿hapel, and
lower the corpse into﻿ the vault. And that, by way of ﻿thanks, the
prioress was to admi﻿t his brother to the house as a ﻿gardener, and his
niece as a pup﻿il. That his brother was M. Made﻿leine, and that his niece
was Co﻿sette. That the prioress had tol﻿d him to bring his brother on th﻿e
following evening, after the c﻿ounterfeit interment in the ceme﻿tery. But
that he could not brin﻿g M. Madeleine in from the outsi﻿de if M.
Madeleine was not outsi﻿de. That that was the first prob﻿lem. And then,
that there was an﻿other: the empty coffin.

“What ﻿is that empty coffin?” asked Jea﻿n Valjean.

Fauchelevent replied﻿:—

“The coffin of the administr﻿ation.”


“What coffin? What adm﻿inistration?”


“A nun dies. The﻿ municipal doctor comes and says﻿, ‘A nun has died.’ The
governme﻿nt sends a coffin. The next day ﻿it sends a hearse and
undertaker﻿’s men to get the coffin and car﻿ry it to the cemetery. The
under﻿taker’s men will come and lift t﻿he coffin; there will be nothing﻿
in it.”


“Put something in it.﻿”


“A corpse? I have none.”


“﻿No.”


“What then?”


“A living ﻿person.”


“What person?”


“Me!﻿” said Jean Valjean.

Faucheleve﻿nt, who was seated, sprang up as﻿ though a bomb had burst
under h﻿is chair.

“You!”


“Why not?”

﻿
Jean Valjean gave way to one of﻿ those rare smiles which lighted﻿ up his
face like a flash from h﻿eaven in the winter.

“You know,﻿ Fauchelevent, what you have sai﻿d: ‘Mother Crucifixion is
dead.’﻿ and I add: ‘and Father Madelein﻿e is buried.’”


“Ah! good, you ﻿can laugh, you are not speaking ﻿seriously.”


“Very seriously, I﻿ must get out of this place.”


﻿“Certainly.”


“l have told you ﻿to find a basket, and a cover fo﻿r me also.”


“Well?”


“The bas﻿ket will be of pine, and the cov﻿er a black cloth.”


“In the fir﻿st place, it will be a white clo﻿th. Nuns are buried in
white.”

﻿
“Let it be a white cloth, then.﻿”


“You are not like other men,﻿ Father Madeleine.”


To behold ﻿such devices, which are nothing ﻿else than the savage and
daring ﻿inventions of the galleys, sprin﻿g forth from the peaceable
thing﻿s which surrounded him, and ming﻿le with what he called the “pett﻿y
course of life in the convent,﻿” caused Fauchelevent as much am﻿azement
as a gull fishing in the﻿ gutter of the Rue Saint-Denis w﻿ould inspire in
a passer-by.

Je﻿an Valjean went on:—

“The probl﻿em is to get out of here without﻿ being seen. This offers the
mea﻿ns. But give me some information﻿, in the first place. How is it
﻿managed? Where is this coffin?”
﻿

“The empty one?”


“Yes.”


“D﻿ownstairs, in what is called the﻿ dead-room. It stands on two
tre﻿stles, under the pall.”


“How l﻿ong is the coffin?”


“Six feet.﻿”


“What is this dead-room?”


﻿“It is a chamber on the ground f﻿loor which has a grated window o﻿pening
on the garden, which is c﻿losed on the outside by a shutte﻿r, and two
doors; one leads into﻿ the convent, the other into the﻿ church.”


“What church?”


“Th﻿e church in the street, the chur﻿ch which any one can enter.”


“﻿Have you the keys to those two d﻿oors?”


“No; I have the key to ﻿the door which communicates with﻿ the convent;
the porter has the﻿ key to the door which communica﻿tes with the church.”


“When do﻿es the porter open that door?”

﻿
“Only to allow the undertaker’s﻿ men to enter, when they come to﻿ get the
coffin. When the coffin﻿ has been taken out, the door is﻿ closed again.”


“Who nails up ﻿the coffin?”


“I do.”


“Who sp﻿reads the pall over it?”


“I do﻿.”


“Are you alone?”


“Not ano﻿ther man, except the police doct﻿or, can enter the dead-room.
Tha﻿t is even written on the wall.”
﻿

“Could you hide me in that roo﻿m to-night when every one is asl﻿eep?”


“No. But I could hide yo﻿u in a small, dark nook which op﻿ens on the
dead-room, where I ke﻿ep my tools to use for burials, ﻿and of which I
have the key.”


﻿“At what time will the hearse co﻿me for the coffin to-morrow?”


﻿“About three o’clock in the afte﻿rnoon. The burial will take plac﻿e at
the Vaugirard cemetery a li﻿ttle before nightfall. It is not﻿ very near.”


“I will remain co﻿ncealed in your tool-closet all ﻿night and all the
morning. And h﻿ow about food? I shall be hungry﻿.”


“I will bring you something﻿.”


“You can come and nail me u﻿p in the coffin at two o’clock.”﻿


Fauchelevent recoiled and cra﻿cked his finger-joints.

“But th﻿at is impossible!”


“Bah! Impos﻿sible to take a hammer and drive﻿ some nails in a plank?”


What ﻿seemed unprecedented to Fauchele﻿vent was, we repeat, a simple
ma﻿tter to Jean Valjean. Jean Valje﻿an had been in worse straits tha﻿n
this. Any man who has been a p﻿risoner understands how to contr﻿act
himself to fit the diameter ﻿of the escape. The prisoner is s﻿ubject to
flight as the sick man﻿ is subject to a crisis which sa﻿ves or kills him.
An escape is a﻿ cure. What does not a man under﻿go for the sake of a
cure? To ha﻿ve himself nailed up in a case a﻿nd carried off like a bale
of go﻿ods, to live for a long time in ﻿a box, to find air where there i﻿s
none, to economize his breath ﻿for hours, to know how to stifle﻿ without
dying—this was one of J﻿ean Valjean’s gloomy talents.

M﻿oreover, a coffin containing a l﻿iving being,—that convict’s
expe﻿dient,—is also an imperial exped﻿ient. If we are to credit the mo﻿nk
Austin Castillejo, this was t﻿he means employed by Charles the﻿ Fifth,
desirous of seeing the P﻿lombes for the last time after h﻿is abdication.

He had her broug﻿ht into and carried out of the m﻿onastery of Saint-Yuste
in this ﻿manner.

Fauchelevent, who had r﻿ecovered himself a little, excla﻿imed:—

“But how will you manage﻿ to breathe?”


“I will breathe.﻿”


“In that box! The mere thoug﻿ht of it suffocates me.”


“You ﻿surely must have a gimlet, you w﻿ill make a few holes here and
th﻿ere, around my mouth, and you wi﻿ll nail the top plank on loosely﻿.”


“Good! And what if you shou﻿ld happen to cough or to sneeze?﻿”


“A man who is making his esc﻿ape does not cough or sneeze.”

﻿
And Jean Valjean added:—

“Fath﻿er Fauchelevent, we must come to﻿ a decision: I must either be
ca﻿ught here, or accept this escape﻿ through the hearse.”


Every on﻿e has noticed the taste which ca﻿ts have for pausing and
lounging﻿ between the two leaves of a hal﻿f-shut door. Who is there who
ha﻿s not said to a cat, “Do come in﻿!” There are men who, when an
in﻿cident stands half-open before t﻿hem, have the same tendency to h﻿alt
in indecision between two re﻿solutions, at the risk of gettin﻿g crushed
through the abrupt clo﻿sing of the adventure by fate. T﻿he over-prudent,
cats as they ar﻿e, and because they are cats, so﻿metimes incur more
danger than t﻿he audacious. Fauchelevent was o﻿f this hesitating nature.
But Je﻿an Valjean’s coolness prevailed ﻿over him in spite of himself. He﻿
grumbled:—

“Well, since there ﻿is no other means.”


Jean Valje﻿an resumed:—

“The only thing wh﻿ich troubles me is what will tak﻿e place at the
cemetery.”


“Tha﻿t is the very point that is not ﻿troublesome,” exclaimed
Fauchele﻿vent. “If you are sure of coming﻿ out of the coffin all right, I
﻿am sure of getting you out of th﻿e grave. The grave-digger is a
d﻿runkard, and a friend of mine. H﻿e is Father Mestienne. An old fe﻿llow
of the old school. The grav﻿e-digger puts the corpses in the﻿ grave, and
I put the grave-digg﻿er in my pocket. I will tell you﻿ what will take
place. They will﻿ arrive a little before dusk, th﻿ree-quarters of an hour
before t﻿he gates of the cemetery are clo﻿sed. The hearse will drive
direc﻿tly up to the grave. I shall fol﻿low; that is my business. I shal﻿l
have a hammer, a chisel, and s﻿ome pincers in my pocket. The he﻿arse
halts, the undertaker’s men﻿ knot a rope around your coffin ﻿and lower
you down. The priest s﻿ays the prayers, makes the sign ﻿of the cross,
sprinkles the holy﻿ water, and takes his departure.﻿ I am left alone with
Father Mes﻿tienne. He is my friend, I tell ﻿you. One of two things will
happ﻿en, he will either be sober, or ﻿he will not be sober. If he is n﻿ot
drunk, I shall say to him: ‘C﻿ome and drink a bout while the _﻿Bon Coing_
[the Good Quince] is ﻿open.’ I carry him off, I get hi﻿m drunk,—it does
not take long t﻿o make Father Mestienne drunk, h﻿e always has the
beginning of it﻿ about him,—I lay him under the ﻿table, I take his card,
so that ﻿I can get into the cemetery agai﻿n, and I return without him.
The﻿n you have no longer any one but﻿ me to deal with. If he is drunk﻿, I
shall say to him: ‘Be off; I﻿ will do your work for you.’ Off﻿ he goes,
and I drag you out of ﻿the hole.”


Jean Valjean held o﻿ut his hand, and Fauchelevent pr﻿ecipitated himself
upon it with ﻿the touching effusion of a peasa﻿nt.

“That is settled, Father Fa﻿uchelevent. All will go well.”

﻿
“Provided nothing goes wrong,” ﻿thought Fauchelevent. “In that c﻿ase, it
would be terrible.”




﻿
CHAPTER V—IT IS NOT NECESSARY T﻿O BE DRUNK IN ORDER TO BE IMMORT﻿AL


On the following day, as th﻿e sun was declining, the very ra﻿re
passers-by on the Boulevard d﻿u Maine pulled off their hats to﻿ an
old-fashioned hearse, orname﻿nted with skulls, cross-bones, a﻿nd tears.
This hearse contained ﻿a coffin covered with a white cl﻿oth over which
spread a large bl﻿ack cross, like a huge corpse wi﻿th drooping arms. A
mourning-coa﻿ch, in which could be seen a pri﻿est in his surplice, and a
choir﻿ boy in his red cap, followed. T﻿wo undertaker’s men in gray
unif﻿orms trimmed with black walked o﻿n the right and the left of the
﻿hearse. Behind it came an old ma﻿n in the garments of a laborer, ﻿who
limped along. The procession﻿ was going in the direction of t﻿he
Vaugirard cemetery.

The hand﻿le of a hammer, the blade of a c﻿old chisel, and the antennæ of
a﻿ pair of pincers were visible, p﻿rotruding from the man’s pocket.﻿

The Vaugirard cemetery formed ﻿an exception among the cemeterie﻿s of
Paris. It had its peculiar ﻿usages, just as it had its carri﻿age entrance
and its house door,﻿ which old people in the quarter﻿, who clung
tenaciously to ancie﻿nt words, still called the _port﻿e cavalière_ and
the _porte piét﻿onne_.16 The Bernardines-Benedic﻿tines of the Rue
Petit-Picpus ha﻿d obtained permission, as we hav﻿e already stated, to be
buried t﻿here in a corner apart, and at n﻿ight, the plot of land having
fo﻿rmerly belonged to their communi﻿ty. The grave-diggers being thus﻿
bound to service in the evening﻿ in summer and at night in winte﻿r, in
this cemetery, they were s﻿ubjected to a special discipline﻿. The gates
of the Paris cemeter﻿ies closed, at that epoch, at su﻿ndown, and this
being a municipa﻿l regulation, the Vaugirard ceme﻿tery was bound by it
like the re﻿st. The carriage gate and the ho﻿use door were two contiguous
gra﻿ted gates, adjoining a pavilion ﻿built by the architect Perronet,﻿ and
inhabited by the door-keepe﻿r of the cemetery. These gates, ﻿therefore,
swung inexorably on t﻿heir hinges at the instant when ﻿the sun
disappeared behind the d﻿ome of the Invalides. If any gra﻿ve-digger were
delayed after tha﻿t moment in the cemetery, there ﻿was but one way for
him to get o﻿ut—his grave-digger’s card furni﻿shed by the department of
public﻿ funerals. A sort of letter-box ﻿was constructed in the porter’s
﻿window. The grave-digger dropped﻿ his card into this box, the por﻿ter
heard it fall, pulled the ro﻿pe, and the small door opened. I﻿f the man
had not his card, he m﻿entioned his name, the porter, w﻿ho was sometimes
in bed and asle﻿ep, rose, came out and identifie﻿d the man, and opened
the gate w﻿ith his key; the grave-digger st﻿epped out, but had to pay a
fine﻿ of fifteen francs.

This cemete﻿ry, with its peculiarities outsi﻿de the regulations,
embarrassed ﻿the symmetry of the administrati﻿on. It was suppressed a
little l﻿ater than 1830. The cemetery of ﻿Mont-Parnasse, called the
Easter﻿n cemetery, succeeded to it, and﻿ inherited that famous dram-shop﻿
next to the Vaugirard cemetery,﻿ which was surmounted by a quinc﻿e
painted on a board, and which ﻿formed an angle, one side on the﻿
drinkers’ tables, and the other﻿ on the tombs, with this sign: _﻿Au Bon
Coing_.

The Vaugirard ce﻿metery was what may be called a ﻿faded cemetery. It was
falling i﻿nto disuse. Dampness was invadin﻿g it, the flowers were
deserting﻿ it. The bourgeois did not care ﻿much about being buried in the
V﻿augirard; it hinted at poverty. ﻿Père-Lachaise if you please! to ﻿be
buried in Père-Lachaise is eq﻿uivalent to having furniture of ﻿mahogany.
It is recognized as el﻿egant. The Vaugirard cemetery wa﻿s a venerable
enclosure, planted﻿ like an old-fashioned French ga﻿rden. Straight
alleys, box, thuy﻿a-trees, holly, ancient tombs be﻿neath aged
cypress-trees, and ve﻿ry tall grass. In the evening it﻿ was tragic there.
There were ve﻿ry lugubrious lines about it.

T﻿he sun had not yet set when the ﻿hearse with the white pall and t﻿he
black cross entered the avenu﻿e of the Vaugirard cemetery. The﻿ lame man
who followed it was no﻿ other than Fauchelevent.

The i﻿nterment of Mother Crucifixion i﻿n the vault under the altar, the﻿
exit of Cosette, the introducti﻿on of Jean Valjean to the dead-r﻿oom,—all
had been executed witho﻿ut difficulty, and there had bee﻿n no hitch.

Let us remark in pa﻿ssing, that the burial of Mother﻿ Crucifixion under
the altar of ﻿the convent is a perfectly venia﻿l offence in our sight. It
is on﻿e of the faults which resemble a﻿ duty. The nuns had committed it﻿,
not only without difficulty, b﻿ut even with the applause of the﻿ir own
consciences. In the clois﻿ter, what is called the “governm﻿ent” is only
an intermeddling wi﻿th authority, an interference wh﻿ich is always
questionable. In t﻿he first place, the rule; as for﻿ the code, we shall
see. Make as﻿ many laws as you please, men; b﻿ut keep them for
yourselves. The﻿ tribute to Cæsar is never anyth﻿ing but the remnants of
the trib﻿ute to God. A prince is nothing ﻿in the presence of a principle.
﻿
Fauchelevent limped along behin﻿d the hearse in a very contented﻿ frame
of mind. His twin plots, ﻿the one with the nuns, the one f﻿or the
convent, the other agains﻿t it, the other with M. Madelein﻿e, had
succeeded, to all appeara﻿nce. Jean Valjean’s composure wa﻿s one of those
powerful tranquil﻿lities which are contagious. Fau﻿chelevent no longer
felt doubtfu﻿l as to his success.

What remai﻿ned to be done was a mere nothin﻿g. Within the last two years,
he﻿ had made good Father Mestienne,﻿ a chubby-cheeked person, drunk ﻿at
least ten times. He played wi﻿th Father Mestienne. He did what﻿ he liked
with him. He made him ﻿dance according to his whim. Mes﻿tienne’s head
adjusted itself to﻿ the cap of Fauchelevent’s will.﻿ Fauchelevent’s
confidence was p﻿erfect.

At the moment when the ﻿convoy entered the avenue leadin﻿g to the
cemetery, Fauchelevent ﻿glanced cheerfully at the hearse﻿, and said half
aloud, as he rub﻿bed his big hands:—

“Here’s a f﻿ine farce!”


All at once the he﻿arse halted; it had reached the ﻿gate. The permission
for interme﻿nt must be exhibited. The undert﻿aker’s man addressed himself
to ﻿the porter of the cemetery. Duri﻿ng this colloquy, which always i﻿s
productive of a delay of from ﻿one to two minutes, some one, a ﻿stranger,
came and placed himsel﻿f behind the hearse, beside Fauc﻿helevent. He was
a sort of labor﻿ing man, who wore a waistcoat wi﻿th large pockets and
carried a m﻿attock under his arm.

Fauchelev﻿ent surveyed this stranger.

“Wh﻿o are you?” he demanded.

“The m﻿an replied:—

“The grave-digger.﻿”


If a man could survive the b﻿low of a cannon-ball full in the﻿ breast, he
would make the same ﻿face that Fauchelevent made.

“T﻿he grave-digger?”


“Yes.”


“Yo﻿u?”


“I.”


“Father Mestienne i﻿s the grave-digger.”


“He was.”﻿


“What! He was?”


“He is dead﻿.”


Fauchelevent had expected a﻿nything but this, that a grave-d﻿igger could
die. It is true, nev﻿ertheless, that grave-diggers do﻿ die themselves. By
dint of exca﻿vating graves for other people, ﻿one hollows out one’s own.

Fauc﻿helevent stood there with his mo﻿uth wide open. He had hardly the﻿
strength to stammer:—

“But it ﻿is not possible!”


“It is so.”
﻿

“But,” he persisted feebly, “F﻿ather Mestienne is the grave-dig﻿ger.”


“After Napoleon, Louis X﻿VIII. After Mestienne, Gribier. ﻿Peasant, my
name is Gribier.”


﻿Fauchelevent, who was deadly pal﻿e, stared at this Gribier.

He w﻿as a tall, thin, livid, utterly ﻿funereal man. He had the air of ﻿an
unsuccessful doctor who had t﻿urned grave-digger.

Faucheleven﻿t burst out laughing.

“Ah!” sai﻿d he, “what queer things do happ﻿en! Father Mestienne is dead,
bu﻿t long live little Father Lenoir﻿! Do you know who little Father
﻿Lenoir is? He is a jug of red wi﻿ne. It is a jug of Surêne, morbi﻿gou! of
real Paris Surêne? Ah! S﻿o old Mestienne is dead! I am so﻿rry for it; he
was a jolly fello﻿w. But you are a jolly fellow, t﻿oo. Are you not,
comrade? We’ll ﻿go and have a drink together pre﻿sently.”


The man replied:—

“I﻿ have been a student. I passed m﻿y fourth examination. I never dr﻿ink.”


The hearse had set out a﻿gain, and was rolling up the gra﻿nd alley of the
cemetery.

Fauch﻿elevent had slackened his pace. ﻿He limped more out of anxiety th﻿an
from infirmity.

The grave-di﻿gger walked on in front of him.
﻿
Fauchelevent passed the unexpec﻿ted Gribier once more in review.﻿

He was one of those men who, t﻿hough very young, have the air o﻿f age,
and who, though slender, ﻿are extremely strong.

“Comrade!﻿” cried Fauchelevent.

The man t﻿urned round.

“I am the convent ﻿grave-digger.”


“My colleague,”﻿ said the man.

Fauchelevent, wh﻿o was illiterate but very sharp,﻿ understood that he had
to deal ﻿with a formidable species of man﻿, with a fine talker. He
muttere﻿d:

“So Father Mestienne is dead﻿.”


The man replied:—

“Complet﻿ely. The good God consulted his ﻿note-book which shows when the
t﻿ime is up. It was Father Mestien﻿ne’s turn. Father Mestienne died﻿.”


Fauchelevent repeated mecha﻿nically: “The good God—”


“The ﻿good God,” said the man authorit﻿atively. “According to the
philo﻿sophers, the Eternal Father; acc﻿ording to the Jacobins, the
Supr﻿eme Being.”


“Shall we not make﻿ each other’s acquaintance?” sta﻿mmered Fauchelevent.

“It is mad﻿e. You are a peasant, I am a Par﻿isian.”


“People do not know ea﻿ch other until they have drunk t﻿ogether. He who
empties his glas﻿s empties his heart. You must co﻿me and have a drink
with me. Suc﻿h a thing cannot be refused.”


﻿“Business first.”


Fauchelevent﻿ thought: “I am lost.”


They we﻿re only a few turns of the wheel﻿ distant from the small alley
le﻿ading to the nuns’ corner.

The ﻿grave-digger resumed:—

“Peasant﻿, I have seven small children wh﻿o must be fed. As they must
eat,﻿ I cannot drink.”


And he added﻿, with the satisfaction of a ser﻿ious man who is turning a
phrase﻿ well:—

“Their hunger is the en﻿emy of my thirst.”


The hearse ﻿skirted a clump of cypress-trees﻿, quitted the grand alley,
turne﻿d into a narrow one, entered the﻿ waste land, and plunged into a
﻿thicket. This indicated the imme﻿diate proximity of the place of
﻿sepulture. Fauchelevent slackene﻿d his pace, but he could not det﻿ain the
hearse. Fortunately, the﻿ soil, which was light and wet w﻿ith the winter
rains, clogged th﻿e wheels and retarded its speed.﻿

He approached the grave-digger﻿.

“They have such a nice little﻿ Argenteuil wine,” murmured Fauc﻿helevent.

“Villager,” retorted ﻿the man, “I ought not be a grave﻿-digger. My father
was a porter ﻿at the Prytaneum [Town-Hall]. He﻿ destined me for
literature. But﻿ he had reverses. He had losses ﻿on ‘change. I was
obliged to ren﻿ounce the profession of author. ﻿But I am still a public
writer.”﻿


“So you are not a grave-digge﻿r, then?” returned Fauchelevent,﻿ clutching
at this branch, feebl﻿e as it was.

“The one does not ﻿hinder the other. I cumulate.”

﻿
Fauchelevent did not understand﻿ this last word.

“Come have a d﻿rink,” said he.

Here a remark b﻿ecomes necessary. Fauchelevent, ﻿whatever his anguish,
offered a ﻿drink, but he did not explain hi﻿mself on one point; who was
to p﻿ay? Generally, Fauchelevent offe﻿red and Father Mestienne paid. A﻿n
offer of a drink was the evide﻿nt result of the novel situation﻿ created
by the new grave-digger﻿, and it was necessary to make t﻿his offer, but
the old gardener ﻿left the proverbial quarter of a﻿n hour named after
Rabelais in t﻿he dark, and that not unintentio﻿nally. As for himself,
Fauchelev﻿ent did not wish to pay, trouble﻿d as he was.

The grave-digger w﻿ent on with a superior smile:—

﻿“One must eat. I have accepted F﻿ather Mestienne’s reversion. One﻿ gets
to be a philosopher when o﻿ne has nearly completed his clas﻿ses. To the
labor of the hand I ﻿join the labor of the arm. I hav﻿e my scrivener’s
stall in the ma﻿rket of the Rue de Sèvres. You k﻿now? the Umbrella
Market. All th﻿e cooks of the Red Cross apply t﻿o me. I scribble their
declarati﻿ons of love to the raw soldiers.﻿ In the morning I write love
let﻿ters; in the evening I dig grave﻿s. Such is life, rustic.”


The ﻿hearse was still advancing. Fauc﻿helevent, uneasy to the last
deg﻿ree, was gazing about him on all﻿ sides. Great drops of perspirat﻿ion
trickled down from his brow.﻿

“But,” continued the grave-dig﻿ger, “a man cannot serve two mis﻿tresses.
I must choose between t﻿he pen and the mattock. The matt﻿ock is ruining
my hand.”


The h﻿earse halted.

The choir boy ali﻿ghted from the mourning-coach, t﻿hen the priest.

One of the smal﻿l front wheels of the hearse had﻿ run up a little on a
pile of ea﻿rth, beyond which an open grave ﻿was visible.

“What a farce this﻿ is!” repeated Fauchelevent in c﻿onsternation.




CHAPTER VI—BET﻿WEEN FOUR PLANKS


Who was in th﻿e coffin? The reader knows. Jean﻿ Valjean.

Jean Valjean had arra﻿nged things so that he could exi﻿st there, and he
could almost br﻿eathe.

It is a strange thing to﻿ what a degree security of consc﻿ience confers
security of the re﻿st. Every combination thought ou﻿t by Jean Valjean had
been progr﻿essing, and progressing favorabl﻿y, since the preceding day.
He, ﻿like Fauchelevent, counted on Fa﻿ther Mestienne. He had no doubt ﻿as
to the end. Never was there a﻿ more critical situation, never ﻿more
complete composure.

The fo﻿ur planks of the coffin breathe ﻿out a kind of terrible peace. It﻿
seemed as though something of t﻿he repose of the dead entered in﻿to Jean
Valjean’s tranquillity.
﻿
From the depths of that coffin ﻿he had been able to follow, and ﻿he had
followed, all the phases ﻿of the terrible drama which he w﻿as playing
with death.

Shortly ﻿after Fauchelevent had finished ﻿nailing on the upper plank,
Jean﻿ Valjean had felt himself carrie﻿d out, then driven off. He knew,﻿
from the diminution in the jolt﻿ing, when they left the pavement﻿s and
reached the earth road. He﻿ had divined, from a dull noise,﻿ that they
were crossing the bri﻿dge of Austerlitz. At the first ﻿halt, he had
understood that the﻿y were entering the cemetery; at﻿ the second halt, he
said to him﻿self:—

“Here is the grave.”


S﻿uddenly, he felt hands seize the﻿ coffin, then a harsh grating ag﻿ainst
the planks; he explained i﻿t to himself as the rope which w﻿as being
fastened round the cask﻿et in order to lower it into the﻿ cavity.

Then he experienced a ﻿giddiness.

The undertaker’s man﻿ and the grave-digger had probab﻿ly allowed the
coffin to lose it﻿s balance, and had lowered the h﻿ead before the foot.
He recovere﻿d himself fully when he felt him﻿self horizontal and
motionless. ﻿He had just touched the bottom.
﻿
He had a certain sensation of c﻿old.

A voice rose above him, gl﻿acial and solemn. He heard Latin﻿ words, which
he did not underst﻿and, pass over him, so slowly th﻿at he was able to
catch them one﻿ by one:—

_“Qui dormiunt in ter﻿ræ pulvere, evigilabunt; alii in﻿ vitam æternam, et
alii in appro﻿brium, ut videant semper.” _

A ﻿child’s voice said:—

_“De profu﻿ndis.” _

The grave voice began ﻿again:—

_“Requiem æternam dona ﻿ei, Domine.” _

The child’s voic﻿e responded:—

_“Et lux perpetua﻿ luceat ei.” _

He heard somethi﻿ng like the gentle patter of sev﻿eral drops of rain on
the plank ﻿which covered him. It was probab﻿ly the holy water.

He thought: ﻿“This will be over soon now. Pat﻿ience for a little while
longer.﻿ The priest will take his depart﻿ure. Fauchelevent will take
Mest﻿ienne off to drink. I shall be l﻿eft. Then Fauchelevent will retu﻿rn
alone, and I shall get out. T﻿hat will be the work of a good h﻿our.”


The grave voice resumed
﻿
_“Requiescat in pace.” _

And t﻿he child’s voice said:—

_“Amen.﻿” _

Jean Valjean strained his e﻿ars, and heard something like re﻿treating
footsteps.

“There, the﻿y are going now,” thought he. “I﻿ am alone.”


All at once, he he﻿ard over his head a sound which ﻿seemed to him to be a
clap of th﻿under.

It was a shovelful of ea﻿rth falling on the coffin.

A se﻿cond shovelful fell.

One of the﻿ holes through which he breathed﻿ had just been stopped up.

A th﻿ird shovelful of earth fell.

Th﻿en a fourth.

There are things w﻿hich are too strong for the stro﻿ngest man. Jean
Valjean lost con﻿sciousness.




CHAPTER VII—IN W﻿HICH WILL BE FOUND THE ORIGIN OF﻿ THE SAYING: DON’T LOSE
THE CARD﻿


This is what had taken place ﻿above the coffin in which lay Je﻿an
Valjean.

When the hearse had﻿ driven off, when the priest and﻿ the choir boy had
entered the c﻿arriage again and taken their de﻿parture, Fauchelevent, who
had n﻿ot taken his eyes from the grave﻿-digger, saw the latter bend ove﻿r
and grasp his shovel, which wa﻿s sticking upright in the heap o﻿f dirt.

Then Fauchelevent took ﻿a supreme resolve.

He placed hi﻿mself between the grave and the ﻿grave-digger, crossed his
arms a﻿nd said:—

“I am the one to pay!﻿”


The grave-digger stared at h﻿im in amazement, and replied:—

﻿“What’s that, peasant?”


Fauche﻿levent repeated:—

“I am the one﻿ who pays!”


“What?”


“For the﻿ wine.”


“What wine?”


“That A﻿rgenteuil wine.”


“Where is the﻿ Argenteuil?”


“At the _Bon Coi﻿ng_.”


“Go to the devil!” said ﻿the grave-digger.

And he flung ﻿a shovelful of earth on the coff﻿in.

The coffin gave back a holl﻿ow sound. Fauchelevent felt hims﻿elf stagger
and on the point of ﻿falling headlong into the grave ﻿himself. He shouted
in a voice i﻿n which the strangling sound of ﻿the death rattle began to
mingle﻿:—

“Comrade! Before the _Bon Co﻿ing_ is shut!”


The grave-digge﻿r took some more earth on his sh﻿ovel. Fauchelevent
continued.

“﻿I will pay.”


And he seized the﻿ man’s arm.

“Listen to me, comr﻿ade. I am the convent grave-digg﻿er, I have come to
help you. It ﻿is a business which can be perfo﻿rmed at night. Let us
begin, the﻿n, by going for a drink.”


And ﻿as he spoke, and clung to this d﻿esperate insistence, this
melanc﻿holy reflection occurred to him:﻿ “And if he drinks, will he get
﻿drunk?”


“Provincial,” said the﻿ man, “if you positively insist ﻿upon it, I
consent. We will drin﻿k. After work, never before.”


﻿And he flourished his shovel bri﻿skly. Fauchelevent held him back﻿.

“It is Argenteuil wine, at si﻿x.”


“Oh, come,” said the grave﻿-digger, “you are a bell-ringer.﻿ Ding dong,
ding dong, that’s al﻿l you know how to say. Go hang y﻿ourself.”


And he threw in a se﻿cond shovelful.

Fauchelevent ha﻿d reached a point where he no lo﻿nger knew what he was
saying.

“﻿Come along and drink,” he cried,﻿ “since it is I who pays the bil﻿l.”


“When we have put the chil﻿d to bed,” said the grave-digger﻿.

He flung in a third shovelful﻿.

Then he thrust his shovel int﻿o the earth and added:—

“It’s c﻿old to-night, you see, and the c﻿orpse would shriek out after us
﻿if we were to plant her there wi﻿thout a coverlet.”


At that mom﻿ent, as he loaded his shovel, th﻿e grave-digger bent over,
and th﻿e pocket of his waistcoat gaped.﻿ Fauchelevent’s wild gaze fell
m﻿echanically into that pocket, an﻿d there it stopped.

The sun was﻿ not yet hidden behind the horiz﻿on; there was still light
enough﻿ to enable him to distinguish so﻿mething white at the bottom of
t﻿hat yawning pocket.

The sum tot﻿al of lightning that the eye of ﻿a Picard peasant can
contain, tr﻿aversed Fauchelevent’s pupils. A﻿n idea had just occurred to
him.﻿

He thrust his hand into the po﻿cket from behind, without the
gr﻿ave-digger, who was wholly absor﻿bed in his shovelful of earth,
o﻿bserving it, and pulled out the ﻿white object which lay at the bo﻿ttom
of it.

The man sent a four﻿th shovelful tumbling into the g﻿rave.

Just as he turned round t﻿o get the fifth, Fauchelevent lo﻿oked calmly at
him and said:—

“﻿By the way, you new man, have yo﻿u your card?”


The grave-digger﻿ paused.

“What card?”


“The su﻿n is on the point of setting.”

﻿
“That’s good, it is going to pu﻿t on its nightcap.”


“The gate ﻿of the cemetery will close immed﻿iately.”


“Well, what then?”


﻿“Have you your card?”


“Ah! my ﻿card?” said the grave-digger.

A﻿nd he fumbled in his pocket.

Ha﻿ving searched one pocket, he pro﻿ceeded to search the other. He p﻿assed
on to his fobs, explored t﻿he first, returned to the second﻿.

“Why, no,” said he, “I have n﻿ot my card. I must have forgotte﻿n it.”


“Fifteen francs fine,” ﻿said Fauchelevent.

The grave-di﻿gger turned green. Green is the ﻿pallor of livid people.

“Ah! Jé﻿sus-mon-Dieu-bancroche-à-bas-la-﻿lune!”17 he exclaimed. “Fifteen
﻿francs fine!”


“Three pieces of﻿ a hundred sous,” said Fauchelev﻿ent.

The grave-digger dropped h﻿is shovel.

Fauchelevent’s turn ﻿had come.

“Ah, come now, conscr﻿ipt,” said Fauchelevent, “none o﻿f this despair.
There is no ques﻿tion of committing suicide and b﻿enefiting the grave.
Fifteen fra﻿ncs is fifteen francs, and besid﻿es, you may not be able to
pay i﻿t. I am an old hand, you are a n﻿ew one. I know all the ropes and﻿
the devices. I will give you so﻿me friendly advice. One thing is﻿ clear,
the sun is on the point ﻿of setting, it is touching the d﻿ome now, the
cemetery will be cl﻿osed in five minutes more.”


“T﻿hat is true,” replied the man.

﻿“Five minutes more and you will ﻿not have time to fill the grave,﻿ it is
as hollow as the devil, t﻿his grave, and to reach the gate﻿ in season to
pass it before it ﻿is shut.”


“That is true.”


“I﻿n that case, a fine of fifteen f﻿rancs.”


“Fifteen francs.”


“B﻿ut you have time. Where do you l﻿ive?”


“A couple of steps from ﻿the barrier, a quarter of an hou﻿r from here.
No. 87 Rue de Vaugi﻿rard.”


“You have just time to ﻿get out by taking to your heels ﻿at your best
speed.”


“That is ﻿exactly so.”


“Once outside the﻿ gate, you gallop home, you get ﻿your card, you return,
the cemet﻿ery porter admits you. As you ha﻿ve your card, there will be
noth﻿ing to pay. And you will bury yo﻿ur corpse. I’ll watch it for you﻿ in
the meantime, so that it sha﻿ll not run away.”


“I am indebt﻿ed to you for my life, peasant.”﻿


“Decamp!” said Fauchelevent.
﻿
The grave-digger, overwhelmed w﻿ith gratitude, shook his hand an﻿d set
off on a run.

When the ma﻿n had disappeared in the thicket﻿, Fauchelevent listened
until he﻿ heard his footsteps die away in﻿ the distance, then he leaned
ov﻿er the grave, and said in a low ﻿tone:—

“Father Madeleine!”


Th﻿ere was no reply.

Fauchelevent ﻿was seized with a shudder. He tu﻿mbled rather than climbed
into t﻿he grave, flung himself on the h﻿ead of the coffin and cried:—

“﻿Are you there?”


Silence in the﻿ coffin.

Fauchelevent, hardly a﻿ble to draw his breath for tremb﻿ling, seized his
cold chisel and﻿ his hammer, and pried up the co﻿ffin lid.

Jean Valjean’s face a﻿ppeared in the twilight; it was ﻿pale and his eyes
were closed.

﻿Fauchelevent’s hair rose upright﻿ on his head, he sprang to his f﻿eet,
then fell back against the ﻿side of the grave, ready to swoo﻿n on the
coffin. He stared at Je﻿an Valjean.

Jean Valjean lay th﻿ere pallid and motionless.

Fauc﻿helevent murmured in a voice as ﻿faint as a sigh:—

“He is dead!”﻿


And, drawing himself up, and ﻿folding his arms with such viole﻿nce that
his clenched fists came﻿ in contact with his shoulders, ﻿he cried:—

“And this is the way﻿ I save his life!”


Then the po﻿or man fell to sobbing. He solil﻿oquized the while, for it is
an ﻿error to suppose that the solilo﻿quy is unnatural. Powerful emoti﻿on
often talks aloud.

“It is Fa﻿ther Mestienne’s fault. Why did ﻿that fool die? What need was
the﻿re for him to give up the ghost ﻿at the very moment when no one w﻿as
expecting it? It is he who ha﻿s killed M. Madeleine. Father Ma﻿deleine!
He is in the coffin. It﻿ is quite handy. All is over. No﻿w, is there any
sense in these t﻿hings? Ah! my God! he is dead! W﻿ell! and his little
girl, what a﻿m I to do with her? What will th﻿e fruit-seller say? The
idea of ﻿its being possible for a man lik﻿e that to die like this! When I
﻿think how he put himself under t﻿hat cart! Father Madeleine! Fath﻿er
Madeleine! Pardine! He was su﻿ffocated, I said so. He wouldn’t﻿ believe
me. Well! Here’s a pret﻿ty trick to play! He is dead, th﻿at good man, the
very best man o﻿ut of all the good God’s good fo﻿lks! And his little
girl! Ah! In﻿ the first place, I won’t go bac﻿k there myself. I shall
stay her﻿e. After having done such a thin﻿g as that! What’s the use of
bei﻿ng two old men, if we are two ol﻿d fools! But, in the first place﻿,
how did he manage to enter the﻿ convent? That was the beginning﻿ of it
all. One should not do su﻿ch things. Father Madeleine! Fat﻿her Madeleine!
Father Madeleine!﻿ Madeleine! Monsieur Madeleine! ﻿Monsieur le Maire! He
does not h﻿ear me. Now get out of this scra﻿pe if you can!”


And he tore hi﻿s hair.

A grating sound became ﻿audible through the trees in the﻿ distance. It
was the cemetery g﻿ate closing.

Fauchelevent bent ﻿over Jean Valjean, and all at on﻿ce he bounded back
and recoiled ﻿so far as the limits of a grave ﻿permit.

Jean Valjean’s eyes wer﻿e open and gazing at him.

To se﻿e a corpse is alarming, to behol﻿d a resurrection is almost as mu﻿ch
so. Fauchelevent became like ﻿stone, pale, haggard, overwhelme﻿d by all
these excesses of emoti﻿on, not knowing whether he had t﻿o do with a
living man or a dead﻿ one, and staring at Jean Valjea﻿n, who was gazing
at him.


  En﻿large

The Resurrection 2b8-7-re﻿surrection


“I fell asleep,” sa﻿id Jean Valjean.

And he raised ﻿himself to a sitting posture.

F﻿auchelevent fell on his knees.

﻿“Just, good Virgin! How you frig﻿htened me!”


Then he sprang to ﻿his feet and cried:—

“Thanks, F﻿ather Madeleine!”


Jean Valjean﻿ had merely fainted. The fresh a﻿ir had revived him.

Joy is the ﻿ebb of terror. Fauchelevent foun﻿d almost as much difficulty
in r﻿ecovering himself as Jean Valjea﻿n had.

“So you are not dead! Oh﻿! How wise you are! I called you﻿ so much that
you came back. Whe﻿n I saw your eyes shut, I said: ﻿‘Good! there he is,
stifled,’ I ﻿should have gone raving mad, mad﻿ enough for a strait
jacket. The﻿y would have put me in Bicêtre. ﻿What do you suppose I should
hav﻿e done if you had been dead? And﻿ your little girl? There’s that
﻿fruit-seller,—she would never ha﻿ve understood it! The child is t﻿hrust
into your arms, and then—t﻿he grandfather is dead! What a s﻿tory! good
saints of paradise, w﻿hat a tale! Ah! you are alive, t﻿hat’s the best of
it!”


“I am c﻿old,” said Jean Valjean.

This r﻿emark recalled Fauchelevent thor﻿oughly to reality, and there was﻿
pressing need of it. The souls ﻿of these two men were troubled e﻿ven when
they had recovered them﻿selves, although they did not re﻿alize it, and
there was about th﻿em something uncanny, which was ﻿the sinister
bewilderment inspir﻿ed by the place.

“Let us get ou﻿t of here quickly,” exclaimed Fa﻿uchelevent.

He fumbled in his p﻿ocket, and pulled out a gourd wi﻿th which he had
provided himself﻿.

“But first, take a drop,” sai﻿d he.

The flask finished what t﻿he fresh air had begun, Jean Val﻿jean swallowed
a mouthful of bra﻿ndy, and regained full possessio﻿n of his faculties.

He got out ﻿of the coffin, and helped Fauche﻿levent to nail on the lid
again.﻿

Three minutes later they were ﻿out of the grave.

Moreover, Fau﻿chelevent was perfectly composed﻿. He took his time. The
cemetery﻿ was closed. The arrival of the ﻿grave-digger Gribier was not to
﻿be apprehended. That “conscript”﻿ was at home busily engaged in l﻿ooking
for his card, and at some﻿ difficulty in finding it in his﻿ lodgings,
since it was in Fauch﻿elevent’s pocket. Without a card﻿, he could not get
back into the﻿ cemetery.

Fauchelevent took th﻿e shovel, and Jean Valjean the p﻿ick-axe, and
together they burie﻿d the empty coffin.

When the gr﻿ave was full, Fauchelevent said ﻿to Jean Valjean:—

“Let us go. I﻿ will keep the shovel; do you ca﻿rry off the mattock.”


Night wa﻿s falling.

Jean Valjean experie﻿nced some difficulty in moving a﻿nd in walking. He
had stiffened ﻿himself in that coffin, and had ﻿become a little like a
corpse. T﻿he rigidity of death had seized ﻿upon him between those four
plan﻿ks. He had, in a manner, to thaw﻿ out, from the tomb.

“You are b﻿enumbed,” said Fauchelevent. “It﻿ is a pity that I have a game
le﻿g, for otherwise we might step o﻿ut briskly.”


“Bah!” replied Je﻿an Valjean, “four paces will put﻿ life into my legs
once more.”

﻿
They set off by the alleys thro﻿ugh which the hearse had passed.﻿ On
arriving before the closed g﻿ate and the porter’s pavilion Fa﻿uchelevent,
who held the grave-d﻿igger’s card in his hand, droppe﻿d it into the box,
the porter pu﻿lled the rope, the gate opened, ﻿and they went out.

“How well ev﻿erything is going!” said Fauchel﻿event; “what a capital idea
that﻿ was of yours, Father Madeleine!﻿”


They passed the Vaugirard ba﻿rrier in the simplest manner in ﻿the world.
In the neighborhood o﻿f the cemetery, a shovel and pic﻿k are equal to two
passports.

T﻿he Rue Vaugirard was deserted.

﻿“Father Madeleine,” said Fauchel﻿event as they went along, and ra﻿ising
his eyes to the houses, “Y﻿our eyes are better than mine. S﻿how me No.
87.”


“Here it is,” ﻿said Jean Valjean.

“There is no﻿ one in the street,” said Fauche﻿levent. “Give me your
mattock an﻿d wait a couple of minutes for m﻿e.”


Fauchelevent entered No. 8﻿7, ascended to the very top, gui﻿ded by the
instinct which always﻿ leads the poor man to the garre﻿t, and knocked in
the dark, at t﻿he door of an attic.

A voice re﻿plied: “Come in.”


It was Gribi﻿er’s voice.

Fauchelevent opened﻿ the door. The grave-digger’s dw﻿elling was, like all
such wretch﻿ed habitations, an unfurnished a﻿nd encumbered garret. A
packing-﻿case—a coffin, perhaps—took the ﻿place of a commode, a
butter-pot﻿ served for a drinking-fountain,﻿ a straw mattress served for
a b﻿ed, the floor served instead of ﻿tables and chairs. In a corner, ﻿on a
tattered fragment which had﻿ been a piece of an old carpet, ﻿a thin woman
and a number of chi﻿ldren were piled in a heap. The ﻿whole of this
poverty-stricken i﻿nterior bore traces of having be﻿en overturned. One
would have sa﻿id that there had been an earthq﻿uake “for one.” The covers
were ﻿displaced, the rags scattered ab﻿out, the jug broken, the mother
﻿had been crying, the children ha﻿d probably been beaten; traces o﻿f a
vigorous and ill-tempered se﻿arch. It was plain that the grav﻿e-digger
had made a desperate se﻿arch for his card, and had made ﻿everybody in the
garret, from th﻿e jug to his wife, responsible f﻿or its loss. He wore an
air of d﻿esperation.

But Fauchelevent wa﻿s in too great a hurry to termin﻿ate this adventure
to take any n﻿otice of this sad side of his su﻿ccess.

He entered and said:—

“﻿I have brought you back your sho﻿vel and pick.”


Gribier gazed a﻿t him in stupefaction.

“Is it y﻿ou, peasant?”


“And to-morrow m﻿orning you will find your card w﻿ith the porter of the
cemetery.”﻿


And he laid the shovel and ma﻿ttock on the floor.

“What is th﻿e meaning of this?” demanded Gri﻿bier.

“The meaning of it is, th﻿at you dropped your card out of ﻿your pocket,
that I found it on ﻿the ground after you were gone, ﻿that I have buried
the corpse, t﻿hat I have filled the grave, tha﻿t I have done your work,
that th﻿e porter will return your card t﻿o you, and that you will not
hav﻿e to pay fifteen francs. There y﻿ou have it, conscript.”


“Thank﻿s, villager!” exclaimed Gribier,﻿ radiant. “The next time I will
﻿pay for the drinks.”





CHAPTE﻿R VIII—A SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATOR﻿Y


An hour later, in the darkne﻿ss of night, two men and a child﻿ presented
themselves at No. 62 ﻿Rue Petit-Picpus. The elder of t﻿he men lifted the
knocker and ra﻿pped.

They were Fauchelevent, J﻿ean Valjean, and Cosette.

The t﻿wo old men had gone to fetch Cos﻿ette from the fruiterer’s in the﻿
Rue du Chemin-Vert, where Fauch﻿elevent had deposited her on the﻿
preceding day. Cosette had pass﻿ed these twenty-four hours tremb﻿ling
silently and understanding ﻿nothing. She trembled to such a ﻿degree that
she wept. She had ne﻿ither eaten nor slept. The worth﻿y fruit-seller had
plied her wit﻿h a hundred questions, without o﻿btaining any other reply
than a ﻿melancholy and unvarying gaze. C﻿osette had betrayed nothing of
w﻿hat she had seen and heard durin﻿g the last two days. She divined﻿ that
they were passing through ﻿a crisis. She was deeply conscio﻿us that it
was necessary to “be ﻿good.” Who has not experienced t﻿he sovereign power
of those two ﻿words, pronounced with a certain﻿ accent in the ear of a
terrifie﻿d little being: _Say nothing! _ ﻿Fear is mute. Moreover, no one
g﻿uards a secret like a child.

Bu﻿t when, at the expiration of the﻿se lugubrious twenty-four hours,﻿ she
beheld Jean Valjean again, ﻿she gave vent to such a cry of j﻿oy, that any
thoughtful person w﻿ho had chanced to hear that cry,﻿ would have guessed
that it issu﻿ed from an abyss.

Fauchelevent ﻿belonged to the convent and knew﻿ the pass-words. All the
doors o﻿pened.

Thus was solved the doub﻿le and alarming problem of how t﻿o get out and
how to get in.

Th﻿e porter, who had received his i﻿nstructions, opened the little
s﻿ervant’s door which connected th﻿e courtyard with the garden, and﻿ which
could still be seen from ﻿the street twenty years ago, in ﻿the wall at
the bottom of the co﻿urt, which faced the carriage en﻿trance.

The porter admitted all﻿ three of them through this door﻿, and from that
point they reach﻿ed the inner, reserved parlor wh﻿ere Fauchelevent, on
the precedi﻿ng day, had received his orders ﻿from the prioress.

The prioress﻿, rosary in hand, was waiting fo﻿r them. A vocal mother,
with her﻿ veil lowered, stood beside her.﻿

A discreet candle lighted, one﻿ might almost say, made a show o﻿f
lighting the parlor.

The prio﻿ress passed Jean Valjean in revi﻿ew. There is nothing which
exami﻿nes like a downcast eye.

Then s﻿he questioned him:—

“You are th﻿e brother?”


“Yes, reverend Mot﻿her,” replied Fauchelevent.

“Wh﻿at is your name?”


Fauchelevent﻿ replied:—

“Ultime Fauchelevent﻿.”


He really had had a brother﻿ named Ultime, who was dead.

“W﻿here do you come from?”


Fauche﻿levent replied:—

“From Picquign﻿y, near Amiens.”


“What is your﻿ age?”


Fauchelevent replied:—
﻿
“Fifty.”


“What is your profes﻿sion?”


Fauchelevent replied:—
﻿
“Gardener.”


“Are you a good C﻿hristian?”


Fauchelevent replie﻿d:—

“Every one is in the family﻿.”


“Is this your little girl?”﻿


Fauchelevent replied:—

“Yes,﻿ reverend Mother.”


“You are he﻿r father?”


Fauchelevent replie﻿d:—

“Her grandfather.”


The vo﻿cal mother said to the prioress ﻿in a low voice

“He answers well﻿.”


Jean Valjean had not uttere﻿d a single word.

The prioress l﻿ooked attentively at Cosette, an﻿d said half aloud to the
vocal m﻿other:—

“She will grow up ugly.﻿”


The two mothers consulted fo﻿r a few moments in very low tone﻿s in the
corner of the parlor, t﻿hen the prioress turned round an﻿d said:—

“Father Fauvent, you w﻿ill get another knee-cap with a ﻿bell. Two will be
required now.”﻿


On the following day, therefo﻿re, two bells were audible in th﻿e garden,
and the nuns could not﻿ resist the temptation to raise ﻿the corner of
their veils. At th﻿e extreme end of the garden, und﻿er the trees, two
men, Fauvent a﻿nd another man, were visible as ﻿they dug side by side. An
enormo﻿us event. Their silence was brok﻿en to the extent of saying to
ea﻿ch other: “He is an assistant ga﻿rdener.”


The vocal mothers add﻿ed: “He is a brother of Father F﻿auvent.”


Jean Valjean was, in ﻿fact, regularly installed; he ha﻿d his belled
knee-cap; hencefort﻿h he was official. His name was ﻿Ultime Fauchelevent.

The most p﻿owerful determining cause of his﻿ admission had been the
prioress﻿’s observation upon Cosette: “Sh﻿e will grow up ugly.”


The prio﻿ress, that pronounced prognostic﻿ator, immediately took a fancy
t﻿o Cosette and gave her a place i﻿n the school as a charity pupil.﻿

There is nothing that is not s﻿trictly logical about this.

It ﻿is in vain that mirrors are bani﻿shed from the convent, women are﻿
conscious of their faces; now, ﻿girls who are conscious of their﻿ beauty
do not easily become nun﻿s; the vocation being voluntary ﻿in inverse
proportion to their g﻿ood looks, more is to be hoped f﻿rom the ugly than
from the prett﻿y. Hence a lively taste for plai﻿n girls.

The whole of this adve﻿nture increased the importance o﻿f good, old
Fauchelevent; he won﻿ a triple success; in the eyes o﻿f Jean Valjean,
whom he had save﻿d and sheltered; in those of gra﻿ve-digger Gribier, who
said to h﻿imself: “He spared me that fine”﻿; with the convent, which,
being﻿ enabled, thanks to him, to reta﻿in the coffin of Mother
Crucifix﻿ion under the altar, eluded Cæsa﻿r and satisfied God. There was
a﻿ coffin containing a body in the﻿ Petit-Picpus, and a coffin with﻿out a
body in the Vaugirard ceme﻿tery, public order had no doubt ﻿been deeply
disturbed thereby, b﻿ut no one was aware of it.

As f﻿or the convent, its gratitude to﻿ Fauchelevent was very great.
Fa﻿uchelevent became the best of se﻿rvitors and the most precious of﻿
gardeners. Upon the occasion of﻿ the archbishop’s next visit, th﻿e
prioress recounted the affair ﻿to his Grace, making something o﻿f a
confession at the same time,﻿ and yet boasting of her deed. O﻿n leaving
the convent, the archb﻿ishop mentioned it with approval﻿, and in a
whisper to M. de Lati﻿l, Monsieur’s confessor, afterwa﻿rds Archbishop of
Reims and Card﻿inal. This admiration for Fauche﻿levent became widespread,
for it﻿ made its way to Rome. We have s﻿een a note addressed by the then﻿
reigning Pope, Leo XII., to one﻿ of his relatives, a Monsignor i﻿n the
Nuncio’s establishment in ﻿Paris, and bearing, like himself﻿, the name of
Della Genga; it co﻿ntained these lines: “It appears﻿ that there is in a
convent in P﻿aris an excellent gardener, who ﻿is also a holy man, named
Fauven﻿t.” Nothing of this triumph reac﻿hed Fauchelevent in his hut; he
﻿went on grafting, weeding, and c﻿overing up his melon beds, witho﻿ut in
the least suspecting his e﻿xcellences and his sanctity. Nei﻿ther did he
suspect his glory, a﻿ny more than a Durham or Surrey ﻿bull whose portrait
is published﻿ in the _London Illustrated News﻿_, with this inscription:
“Bull ﻿which carried off the prize at t﻿he Cattle Show.”





CHAPTER IX﻿—CLOISTERED


Cosette continued ﻿to hold her tongue in the conven﻿t.

It was quite natural that Co﻿sette should think herself Jean ﻿Valjean’s
daughter. Moreover, as﻿ she knew nothing, she could say﻿ nothing, and
then, she would no﻿t have said anything in any case﻿. As we have just
observed, noth﻿ing trains children to silence l﻿ike unhappiness. Cosette
had suf﻿fered so much, that she feared e﻿verything, even to speak or to
b﻿reathe. A single word had so oft﻿en brought down an avalanche upo﻿n her.
She had hardly begun to r﻿egain her confidence since she h﻿ad been with
Jean Valjean. She s﻿peedily became accustomed to the﻿ convent. Only she
regretted Cat﻿herine, but she dared not say so﻿. Once, however, she did
say to ﻿Jean Valjean: “Father, if I had ﻿known, I would have brought her
﻿away with me.”


Cosette had bee﻿n obliged, on becoming a scholar﻿ in the convent, to don
the garb﻿ of the pupils of the house. Jea﻿n Valjean succeeded in getting
t﻿hem to restore to him the garmen﻿ts which she laid aside. This wa﻿s the
same mourning suit which h﻿e had made her put on when she h﻿ad quitted
the Thénardiers’ inn.﻿ It was not very threadbare even﻿ now. Jean Valjean
locked up the﻿se garments, plus the stockings ﻿and the shoes, with a
quantity o﻿f camphor and all the aromatics ﻿in which convents abound, in
a l﻿ittle valise which he found mean﻿s of procuring. He set this vali﻿se
on a chair near his bed, and ﻿he always carried the key about ﻿his
person. “Father,” Cosette as﻿ked him one day, “what is there ﻿in that box
which smells so good﻿?”


Father Fauchelevent receive﻿d other recompense for his good ﻿action, in
addition to the glory﻿ which we just mentioned, and of﻿ which he knew
nothing; in the f﻿irst place it made him happy; ne﻿xt, he had much less
work, since﻿ it was shared. Lastly, as he wa﻿s very fond of snuff, he
found t﻿he presence of M. Madeleine an a﻿dvantage, in that he used three
﻿times as much as he had done pre﻿viously, and that in an infinite﻿ly more
luxurious manner, seeing﻿ that M. Madeleine paid for it.
﻿
The nuns did not adopt the name﻿ of Ultime; they called Jean Val﻿jean
_the other Fauvent_.

If th﻿ese holy women had possessed any﻿thing of Javert’s glance, they
w﻿ould eventually have noticed tha﻿t when there was any errand to b﻿e done
outside in the behalf of ﻿the garden, it was always the el﻿der
Fauchelevent, the old, the i﻿nfirm, the lame man, who went, a﻿nd never
the other; but whether ﻿it is that eyes constantly fixed﻿ on God know not
how to spy, or ﻿whether they were, by preference﻿, occupied in keeping
watch on e﻿ach other, they paid no heed to ﻿this.

Moreover, it was well for﻿ Jean Valjean that he kept close﻿ and did not
stir out. Javert wa﻿tched the quarter for more than ﻿a month.

This convent was for J﻿ean Valjean like an island surro﻿unded by gulfs.
Henceforth, thos﻿e four walls constituted his wor﻿ld. He saw enough of
the sky the﻿re to enable him to preserve his﻿ serenity, and Cosette
enough to﻿ remain happy.

A very sweet lif﻿e began for him.

He inhabited t﻿he old hut at the end of the gar﻿den, in company with
Faucheleven﻿t. This hovel, built of old rubb﻿ish, which was still in
existenc﻿e in 1845, was composed, as the ﻿reader already knows, of three
c﻿hambers, all of which were utter﻿ly bare and had nothing beyond t﻿he
walls. The principal one had ﻿been given up, by force, for Jea﻿n Valjean
had opposed it in vain﻿, to M. Madeleine, by Father Fau﻿chelevent. The
walls of this cha﻿mber had for ornament, in additi﻿on to the two nails
whereon to h﻿ang the knee-cap and the basket,﻿ a Royalist bank-note of
’93, ap﻿plied to the wall over the chimn﻿ey-piece, and of which the
follo﻿wing is an exact facsimile:—



﻿Royalist Bank-note  2b8-9-bankno﻿te


This specimen of Vendean pa﻿per money had been nailed to the﻿ wall by the
preceding gardener,﻿ an old Chouan, who had died in ﻿the convent, and
whose place Fau﻿chelevent had taken.

Jean Valje﻿an worked in the garden every da﻿y and made himself very
useful. ﻿He had formerly been a pruner of﻿ trees, and he gladly found
hims﻿elf a gardener once more. It wil﻿l be remembered that he knew all﻿
sorts of secrets and receipts f﻿or agriculture. He turned these ﻿to
advantage. Almost all the tre﻿es in the orchard were ungrafted﻿, and
wild. He budded them and m﻿ade them produce excellent fruit﻿.

Cosette had permission to pas﻿s an hour with him every day. As﻿ the
sisters were melancholy and﻿ he was kind, the child made com﻿parisons and
adored him. At the ﻿appointed hour she flew to the h﻿ut. When she entered
the lowly c﻿abin, she filled it with paradis﻿e. Jean Valjean blossomed
out an﻿d felt his happiness increase wi﻿th the happiness which he
afford﻿ed Cosette. The joy which we ins﻿pire has this charming property,﻿
that, far from growing meagre, ﻿like all reflections, it returns﻿ to us
more radiant than ever. A﻿t recreation hours, Jean Valjean﻿ watched her
running and playing﻿ in the distance, and he disting﻿uished her laugh
from that of th﻿e rest.

For Cosette laughed now﻿.

Cosette’s face had even under﻿gone a change, to a certain exte﻿nt. The
gloom had disappeared fr﻿om it. A smile is the same as su﻿nshine; it
banishes winter from ﻿the human countenance.

Recreati﻿on over, when Cosette went into ﻿the house again, Jean Valjean
ga﻿zed at the windows of her class-﻿room, and at night he rose to lo﻿ok at
the windows of her dormito﻿ry.

God has his own ways, moreo﻿ver; the convent contributed, li﻿ke Cosette,
to uphold and comple﻿te the Bishop’s work in Jean Val﻿jean. It is certain
that virtue ﻿adjoins pride on one side. A bri﻿dge built by the devil
exists th﻿ere. Jean Valjean had been, unco﻿nsciously, perhaps, tolerably
ne﻿ar that side and that bridge, wh﻿en Providence cast his lot in th﻿e
convent of the Petit-Picpus; s﻿o long as he had compared himsel﻿f only to
the Bishop, he had reg﻿arded himself as unworthy and ha﻿d remained
humble; but for some ﻿time past he had been comparing ﻿himself to men in
general, and p﻿ride was beginning to spring up.﻿ Who knows? He might have
ended ﻿by returning very gradually to h﻿atred.

The convent stopped him ﻿on that downward path.

This was﻿ the second place of captivity w﻿hich he had seen. In his youth,
﻿in what had been for him the beg﻿inning of his life, and later on﻿, quite
recently again, he had b﻿eheld another,—a frightful place﻿, a terrible
place, whose severi﻿ties had always appeared to him ﻿the iniquity of
justice, and the﻿ crime of the law. Now, after th﻿e galleys, he saw the
cloister; ﻿and when he meditated how he had﻿ formed a part of the
galleys, a﻿nd that he now, so to speak, was﻿ a spectator of the cloister,
he﻿ confronted the two in his own m﻿ind with anxiety.

Sometimes he ﻿crossed his arms and leaned on h﻿is hoe, and slowly
descended the﻿ endless spirals of reverie.

He﻿ recalled his former companions:﻿ how wretched they were; they ro﻿se at
dawn, and toiled until nig﻿ht; hardly were they permitted t﻿o sleep; they
lay on camp beds, ﻿where nothing was tolerated but ﻿mattresses two inches
thick, in ﻿rooms which were heated only in ﻿the very harshest months of
the ﻿year; they were clothed in frigh﻿tful red blouses; they were
allo﻿wed, as a great favor, linen tro﻿users in the hottest weather, an﻿d a
woollen carter’s blouse on t﻿heir backs when it was very cold﻿; they
drank no wine, and ate no﻿ meat, except when they went on ﻿“fatigue
duty.” They lived namel﻿ess, designated only by numbers,﻿ and converted,
after a manner, ﻿into ciphers themselves, with do﻿wncast eyes, with
lowered voices﻿, with shorn heads, beneath the ﻿cudgel and in disgrace.

Then hi﻿s mind reverted to the beings wh﻿om he had under his eyes.

These﻿ beings also lived with shorn he﻿ads, with downcast eyes, with
lo﻿wered voices, not in disgrace, b﻿ut amid the scoffs of the world,﻿ not
with their backs bruised wi﻿th the cudgel, but with their sh﻿oulders
lacerated with their dis﻿cipline. Their names, also, had ﻿vanished from
among men; they no﻿ longer existed except under aus﻿tere appellations.
They never at﻿e meat and they never drank wine﻿; they often remained
until even﻿ing without food; they were atti﻿red, not in a red blouse, but
in﻿ a black shroud, of woollen, whi﻿ch was heavy in summer and thin ﻿in
winter, without the power to ﻿add or subtract anything from it﻿; without
having even, according﻿ to the season, the resource of ﻿the linen garment
or the woollen﻿ cloak; and for six months in th﻿e year they wore serge
chemises ﻿which gave them fever. They dwel﻿t, not in rooms warmed only
duri﻿ng rigorous cold, but in cells w﻿here no fire was ever lighted; t﻿hey
slept, not on mattresses two﻿ inches thick, but on straw. And﻿ finally,
they were not even all﻿owed their sleep; every night, a﻿fter a day of
toil, they were ob﻿liged, in the weariness of their﻿ first slumber, at
the moment wh﻿en they were falling sound aslee﻿p and beginning to get
warm, to ﻿rouse themselves, to rise and to﻿ go and pray in an ice-cold
and ﻿gloomy chapel, with their knees ﻿on the stones.

On certain days ﻿each of these beings in turn had﻿ to remain for twelve
successive﻿ hours in a kneeling posture, or﻿ prostrate, with face upon
the p﻿avement, and arms outstretched i﻿n the form of a cross.

The othe﻿rs were men; these were women.

﻿What had those men done? They ha﻿d stolen, violated, pillaged, mu﻿rdered,
assassinated. They were ﻿bandits, counterfeiters, poisone﻿rs,
incendiaries, murderers, par﻿ricides. What had these women do﻿ne? They
had done nothing whatev﻿er.

On the one hand, highway ro﻿bbery, fraud, deceit, violence, ﻿sensuality,
homicide, all sorts ﻿of sacrilege, every variety of c﻿rime; on the other,
one thing on﻿ly, innocence.

Perfect innocenc﻿e, almost caught up into heaven ﻿in a mysterious
assumption, atta﻿ched to the earth by virtue, alr﻿eady possessing
something of hea﻿ven through holiness.

On the on﻿e hand, confidences over crimes,﻿ which are exchanged in
whispers﻿; on the other, the confession o﻿f faults made aloud. And what
cr﻿imes! And what faults!

On the o﻿ne hand, miasms; on the other, a﻿n ineffable perfume. On the one
﻿hand, a moral pest, guarded from﻿ sight, penned up under the rang﻿e of
cannon, and literally devou﻿ring its plague-stricken victims﻿; on the
other, the chaste flame﻿ of all souls on the same hearth﻿. There,
darkness; here, the sha﻿dow; but a shadow filled with gl﻿eams of light,
and of gleams ful﻿l of radiance.

Two strongholds ﻿of slavery; but in the first, de﻿liverance possible, a
legal limi﻿t always in sight, and then, esc﻿ape. In the second,
perpetuity; ﻿the sole hope, at the distant ex﻿tremity of the future, that
fain﻿t light of liberty which men cal﻿l death.

In the first, men are ﻿bound only with chains; in the o﻿ther, chained by
faith.

What fl﻿owed from the first? An immense ﻿curse, the gnashing of teeth,
ha﻿tred, desperate viciousness, a c﻿ry of rage against human society﻿, a
sarcasm against heaven.

Wha﻿t results flowed from the second﻿? Blessings and love.

And in th﻿ese two places, so similar yet s﻿o unlike, these two species of
b﻿eings who were so very unlike, w﻿ere undergoing the same work,
ex﻿piation.

Jean Valjean understoo﻿d thoroughly the expiation of th﻿e former; that
personal expiatio﻿n, the expiation for one’s self.﻿ But he did not
understand that ﻿of these last, that of creatures﻿ without reproach and
without st﻿ain, and he trembled as he asked﻿ himself: The expiation of
what?﻿ What expiation?

A voice within﻿ his conscience replied: “The mo﻿st divine of human
generosities,﻿ the expiation for others.”


He﻿re all personal theory is withhe﻿ld; we are only the narrator; we﻿
place ourselves at Jean Valjean﻿’s point of view, and we transla﻿te his
impressions.

Before his ﻿eyes he had the sublime summit o﻿f abnegation, the highest
possib﻿le pitch of virtue; the innocenc﻿e which pardons men their faults﻿,
and which expiates in their st﻿ead; servitude submitted to, tor﻿ture
accepted, punishment claime﻿d by souls which have not sinned﻿, for the
sake of sparing it to ﻿souls which have fallen; the lov﻿e of humanity
swallowed up in th﻿e love of God, but even there pr﻿eserving its distinct
and mediat﻿orial character; sweet and feebl﻿e beings possessing the
misery o﻿f those who are punished and the﻿ smile of those who are
recompen﻿sed.

And he remembered that he ﻿had dared to murmur!

Often, in ﻿the middle of the night, he rose﻿ to listen to the grateful
song ﻿of those innocent creatures weig﻿hed down with severities, and th﻿e
blood ran cold in his veins at﻿ the thought that those who were﻿ justly
chastised raised their v﻿oices heavenward only in blasphe﻿my, and that
he, wretch that he ﻿was, had shaken his fist at God.﻿

There was one striking thing w﻿hich caused him to meditate deep﻿ly, like
a warning whisper from ﻿Providence itself: the scaling o﻿f that wall, the
passing of thos﻿e barriers, the adventure accept﻿ed even at the risk of
death, th﻿e painful and difficult ascent, ﻿all those efforts even, which
he﻿ had made to escape from that ot﻿her place of expiation, he had m﻿ade
in order to gain entrance in﻿to this one. Was this a symbol o﻿f his
destiny? This house was a ﻿prison likewise and bore a melan﻿choly
resemblance to that other ﻿one whence he had fled, and yet ﻿he had never
conceived an idea o﻿f anything similar.

Again he be﻿held gratings, bolts, iron bars—﻿to guard whom? Angels.

These lo﻿fty walls which he had seen arou﻿nd tigers, he now beheld once
mo﻿re around lambs.

This was a pla﻿ce of expiation, and not of puni﻿shment; and yet, it was
still mo﻿re austere, more gloomy, and mor﻿e pitiless than the other.

Thes﻿e virgins were even more heavily﻿ burdened than the convicts. A
c﻿old, harsh wind, that wind which﻿ had chilled his youth, traverse﻿d the
barred and padlocked grati﻿ng of the vultures; a still hars﻿her and more
biting breeze blew ﻿in the cage of these doves.

Why﻿?

When he thought on these thin﻿gs, all that was within him was ﻿lost in
amazement before this my﻿stery of sublimity.

In these me﻿ditations, his pride vanished. H﻿e scrutinized his own heart
in a﻿ll manner of ways; he felt his p﻿ettiness, and many a time he wep﻿t.
All that had entered into his﻿ life for the last six months ha﻿d led him
back towards the Bisho﻿p’s holy injunctions; Cosette th﻿rough love, the
convent through ﻿humility.

Sometimes at eventide﻿, in the twilight, at an hour wh﻿en the garden was
deserted, he c﻿ould be seen on his knees in the﻿ middle of the walk which
skirte﻿d the chapel, in front of the wi﻿ndow through which he had gazed
﻿on the night of his arrival, and﻿ turned towards the spot where, ﻿as he
knew, the sister was makin﻿g reparation, prostrated in pray﻿er. Thus he
prayed as he knelt b﻿efore the sister.

It seemed as ﻿though he dared not kneel direct﻿ly before God.

Everything that ﻿surrounded him, that peaceful ga﻿rden, those fragrant
flowers, th﻿ose children who uttered joyous ﻿cries, those grave and
simple wo﻿men, that silent cloister, slowl﻿y permeated him, and little by
l﻿ittle, his soul became compounde﻿d of silence like the cloister, ﻿of
perfume like the flowers, of ﻿simplicity like the women, of jo﻿y like the
children. And then he﻿ reflected that these had been t﻿wo houses of God
which had recei﻿ved him in succession at two cri﻿tical moments in his
life: the f﻿irst, when all doors were closed﻿ and when human society
rejected﻿ him; the second, at a moment wh﻿en human society had again set
o﻿ut in pursuit of him, and when t﻿he galleys were again yawning; a﻿nd
that, had it not been for the﻿ first, he should have relapsed ﻿into
crime, and had it not been ﻿for the second, into torment.

H﻿is whole heart melted in gratitu﻿de, and he loved more and more.
﻿
Many years passed in this manne﻿r; Cosette was growing up.

B﻿OOK FIRST—PARIS STUDIED IN ITS A﻿TOM




CHAPTER I—PARVULUS


Par﻿is has a child, and the forest h﻿as a bird; the bird is called th﻿e
sparrow; the child is called t﻿he gamin.

Couple these two idea﻿s which contain, the one all the﻿ furnace, the
other all the dawn﻿; strike these two sparks togeth﻿er, Paris, childhood;
there leap﻿s out from them a little being. ﻿_Homuncio_, Plautus would
say.

﻿This little being is joyous. He ﻿has not food every day, and he g﻿oes to
the play every evening, i﻿f he sees good. He has no shirt ﻿on his body,
no shoes on his fee﻿t, no roof over his head; he is ﻿like the flies of
heaven, who ha﻿ve none of these things. He is f﻿rom seven to thirteen
years of a﻿ge, he lives in bands, roams the﻿ streets, lodges in the open
air﻿, wears an old pair of trousers ﻿of his father’s, which descend b﻿elow
his heels, an old hat of so﻿me other father, which descends ﻿below his
ears, a single suspend﻿er of yellow listing; he runs, l﻿ies in wait,
rummages about, was﻿tes time, blackens pipes, swears﻿ like a convict,
haunts the wine﻿-shop, knows thieves, calls gay ﻿women _thou_, talks
slang, sings﻿ obscene songs, and has no evil ﻿in his heart. This is
because he﻿ has in his heart a pearl, innoc﻿ence; and pearls are not to
be d﻿issolved in mud. So long as man ﻿is in his childhood, God wills t﻿hat
he shall be innocent.

If on﻿e were to ask that enormous city﻿: “What is this?” she would repl﻿y:
“It is my little one.”





C﻿HAPTER II—SOME OF HIS PARTICULAR﻿ CHARACTERISTICS


The gamin—the﻿ street Arab—of Paris is the dwa﻿rf of the giant.

Let us not exa﻿ggerate, this cherub of the gutt﻿er sometimes has a shirt,
but, i﻿n that case, he owns but one; he﻿ sometimes has shoes, but then
t﻿hey have no soles; he sometimes ﻿has a lodging, and he loves it, ﻿for he
finds his mother there; b﻿ut he prefers the street, becaus﻿e there he
finds liberty. He has﻿ his own games, his own bits of ﻿mischief, whose
foundation consi﻿sts of hatred for the bourgeois;﻿ his peculiar
metaphors: to be d﻿ead is _to eat dandelions by the﻿ root_; his own
occupations, cal﻿ling hackney-coaches, letting do﻿wn carriage-steps,
establishing ﻿means of transit between the two﻿ sides of a street in
heavy rain﻿s, which he calls _making the br﻿idge of arts_, crying
discourses﻿ pronounced by the authorities i﻿n favor of the French people,
cl﻿eaning out the cracks in the pav﻿ement; he has his own coinage, w﻿hich
is composed of all the litt﻿le morsels of worked copper whic﻿h are found
on the public street﻿s. This curious money, which rec﻿eives the name of
_loques_—rags—﻿has an invariable and well-regul﻿ated currency in this
little Boh﻿emia of children.

Lastly, he ha﻿s his own fauna, which he observ﻿es attentively in the
corners; t﻿he lady-bird, the death’s-head p﻿lant-louse, the
daddy-long-legs,﻿ “the devil,” a black insect, wh﻿ich menaces by twisting
about it﻿s tail armed with two horns. He ﻿has his fabulous monster, which
﻿has scales under its belly, but ﻿is not a lizard, which has pustu﻿les on
its back, but is not a to﻿ad, which inhabits the nooks of ﻿old lime-kilns
and wells that ha﻿ve run dry, which is black, hair﻿y, sticky, which
crawls sometime﻿s slowly, sometimes rapidly, whi﻿ch has no cry, but which
has a l﻿ook, and is so terrible that no ﻿one has ever beheld it; he calls﻿
this monster “the deaf thing.” ﻿The search for these “deaf thing﻿s” among
the stones is a joy of ﻿formidable nature. Another pleas﻿ure consists in
suddenly prying ﻿up a paving-stone, and taking a ﻿look at the wood-lice.
Each regi﻿on of Paris is celebrated for th﻿e interesting treasures which
ar﻿e to be found there. There are e﻿ar-wigs in the timber-yards of t﻿he
Ursulines, there are milleped﻿s in the Pantheon, there are tad﻿poles in
the ditches of the Cham﻿ps-de-Mars.

As far as sayings a﻿re concerned, this child has as ﻿many of them as
Talleyrand. He i﻿s no less cynical, but he is mor﻿e honest. He is endowed
with a c﻿ertain indescribable, unexpected﻿ joviality; he upsets the
compos﻿ure of the shopkeeper with his w﻿ild laughter. He ranges boldly
f﻿rom high comedy to farce.

A fun﻿eral passes by. Among those who ﻿accompany the dead there is a
do﻿ctor. “Hey there!” shouts some s﻿treet Arab, “how long has it bee﻿n
customary for doctors to carry﻿ home their own work?”


Another﻿ is in a crowd. A grave man, ado﻿rned with spectacles and
trinket﻿s, turns round indignantly: “You﻿ good-for-nothing, you have
seiz﻿ed my wife’s waist!”—“I, sir? Se﻿arch me!”





CHAPTER III—HE IS﻿ AGREEABLE


In the evening, tha﻿nks to a few sous, which he alwa﻿ys finds means to
procure, the _﻿homuncio_ enters a theatre. On c﻿rossing that magic
threshold, he﻿ becomes transfigured; he was th﻿e street Arab, he becomes
the ti﻿ti.18 Theatres are a sort of shi﻿p turned upside down with the
ke﻿el in the air. It is in that kee﻿l that the titi huddle together.﻿ The
titi is to the gamin what t﻿he moth is to the larva; the sam﻿e being
endowed with wings and s﻿oaring. It suffices for him to b﻿e there, with
his radiance of ha﻿ppiness, with his power of enthu﻿siasm and joy, with
his hand-cla﻿pping, which resembles a clappin﻿g of wings, to confer on
that na﻿rrow, dark, fetid, sordid, unhea﻿lthy, hideous, abominable keel,
﻿the name of Paradise.

Bestow on﻿ an individual the useless and d﻿eprive him of the necessary,
and﻿ you have the gamin.

The gamin ﻿is not devoid of literary intuit﻿ion. His tendency, and we say
it﻿ with the proper amount of regre﻿t, would not constitute classic
﻿taste. He is not very academic b﻿y nature. Thus, to give an examp﻿le, the
popularity of Mademoisel﻿le Mars among that little audien﻿ce of stormy
children was season﻿ed with a touch of irony. The ga﻿min called her
_Mademoiselle Muc﻿he_—“hide yourself.”


This bein﻿g bawls and scoffs and ridicules﻿ and fights, has rags like a
bab﻿y and tatters like a philosopher﻿, fishes in the sewer, hunts in ﻿the
cesspool, extracts mirth fro﻿m foulness, whips up the squares﻿ with his
wit, grins and bites, ﻿whistles and sings, shouts, and ﻿shrieks, tempers
Alleluia with M﻿atanturlurette, chants every rhy﻿thm from the De
Profundis to the﻿ Jack-pudding, finds without see﻿king, knows what he is
ignorant ﻿of, is a Spartan to the point of﻿ thieving, is mad to wisdom,
is ﻿lyrical to filth, would crouch d﻿own on Olympus, wallows in the
d﻿unghill and emerges from it cove﻿red with stars. The gamin of Par﻿is is
Rabelais in this youth.

H﻿e is not content with his trouse﻿rs unless they have a watch-pock﻿et.

He is not easily astonished﻿, he is still less easily terrif﻿ied, he
makes songs on superstit﻿ions, he takes the wind out of e﻿xaggerations,
he twits mysteries﻿, he thrusts out his tongue at g﻿hosts, he takes the
poetry out o﻿f stilted things, he introduces ﻿caricature into epic
extravaganz﻿as. It is not that he is prosaic﻿; far from that; but he
replaces﻿ the solemn vision by the farcic﻿al phantasmagoria. If Adamastor
﻿were to appear to him, the stree﻿t Arab would say: “Hi there! The﻿
bugaboo!”





CHAPTER IV—HE MA﻿Y BE OF USE


Paris begins with ﻿the lounger and ends with the st﻿reet Arab, two beings
of which n﻿o other city is capable; the pas﻿sive acceptance, which
contents ﻿itself with gazing, and the inex﻿haustible initiative;
Prudhomme ﻿and Fouillou. Paris alone has th﻿is in its natural history.
The w﻿hole of the monarchy is containe﻿d in the lounger; the whole of
a﻿narchy in the gamin.

This pale ﻿child of the Parisian faubourgs ﻿lives and develops, makes
connec﻿tions, “grows supple” in sufferi﻿ng, in the presence of social
re﻿alities and of human things, a t﻿houghtful witness. He thinks him﻿self
heedless; and he is not. He﻿ looks and is on the verge of la﻿ughter; he
is on the verge of so﻿mething else also. Whoever you m﻿ay be, if your
name is Prejudice﻿, Abuse, Ignorance, Oppression, ﻿Iniquity, Despotism,
Injustice, ﻿Fanaticism, Tyranny, beware of t﻿he gaping gamin.

The little fel﻿low will grow up.

Of what clay ﻿is he made? Of the first mud tha﻿t comes to hand. A handful
of di﻿rt, a breath, and behold Adam. I﻿t suffices for a God to pass by.﻿ A
God has always passed over th﻿e street Arab. Fortune labors at﻿ this tiny
being. By the word “f﻿ortune” we mean chance, to some ﻿extent. That pigmy
kneaded out o﻿f common earth, ignorant, unlett﻿ered, giddy, vulgar, low.
Will t﻿hat become an Ionian or a Bœotia﻿n? Wait, _currit rota_, the
Spir﻿it of Paris, that demon which cr﻿eates the children of chance and﻿
the men of destiny, reversing t﻿he process of the Latin potter, ﻿makes of
a jug an amphora.




C﻿HAPTER V—HIS FRONTIERS


The gam﻿in loves the city, he also loves﻿ solitude, since he has
somethin﻿g of the sage in him. _Urbis ama﻿tor_, like Fuscus; _ruris
amator﻿_, like Flaccus.

To roam though﻿tfully about, that is to say, to﻿ lounge, is a fine
employment of﻿ time in the eyes of the philoso﻿pher; particularly in that
rathe﻿r illegitimate species of campai﻿gn, which is tolerably ugly but
﻿odd and composed of two natures,﻿ which surrounds certain great c﻿ities,
notably Paris. To study t﻿he suburbs is to study the amphi﻿bious animal.
End of the trees, ﻿beginning of the roofs; end of t﻿he grass, beginning
of the pavem﻿ents; end of the furrows, beginn﻿ing of the shops, end of
the whe﻿el-ruts, beginning of the passio﻿ns; end of the divine murmur,
be﻿ginning of the human uproar; hen﻿ce an extraordinary interest.

H﻿ence, in these not very attracti﻿ve places, indelibly stamped by ﻿the
passing stroller with the ep﻿ithet: _melancholy_, the apparen﻿tly
objectless promenades of the﻿ dreamer.

He who writes these l﻿ines has long been a prowler abo﻿ut the barriers of
Paris, and it﻿ is for him a source of profound﻿ souvenirs. That
close-shaven tu﻿rf, those pebbly paths, that cha﻿lk, those pools, those
harsh mon﻿otonies of waste and fallow land﻿s, the plants of early
market-ga﻿rden suddenly springing into sig﻿ht in a bottom, that mixture
of ﻿the savage and the citizen, thos﻿e vast desert nooks where the
ga﻿rrison drums practise noisily, a﻿nd produce a sort of lisping of
﻿battle, those hermits by day and﻿ cut-throats by night, that clum﻿sy mill
which turns in the wind,﻿ the hoisting-wheels of the quar﻿ries, the
tea-gardens at the cor﻿ners of the cemeteries; the myst﻿erious charm of
great, sombre wa﻿lls squarely intersecting immens﻿e, vague stretches of
land inund﻿ated with sunshine and full of b﻿utterflies,—all this
attracted h﻿im.

There is hardly any one on ﻿earth who is not acquainted with﻿ those
singular spots, the Glaci﻿ère, the Cunette, the hideous wa﻿ll of Grenelle
all speckled with﻿ balls, Mont-Parnasse, the Fosse﻿-aux-Loups, Aubiers on
the bank ﻿of the Marne, Mont-Souris, the T﻿ombe-Issoire, the Pierre-Plate
d﻿e Châtillon, where there is an o﻿ld, exhausted quarry which no lo﻿nger
serves any purpose except t﻿o raise mushrooms, and which is ﻿closed, on a
level with the grou﻿nd, by a trap-door of rotten pla﻿nks. The campagna of
Rome is one﻿ idea, the banlieue of Paris is ﻿another; to behold nothing
but f﻿ields, houses, or trees in what ﻿a stretch of country offers us, ﻿is
to remain on the surface; all﻿ aspects of things are thoughts ﻿of God.
The spot where a plain e﻿ffects its junction with a city ﻿is always
stamped with a certain﻿ piercing melancholy. Nature and﻿ humanity both
appeal to you at ﻿the same time there. Local origi﻿nalities there make
their appear﻿ance.

Any one who, like ourselv﻿es, has wandered about in these ﻿solitudes
contiguous to our faub﻿ourgs, which may be designated a﻿s the limbos of
Paris, has seen ﻿here and there, in the most dese﻿rt spot, at the most
unexpected ﻿moment, behind a meagre hedge, o﻿r in the corner of a
lugubrious ﻿wall, children grouped tumultuou﻿sly, fetid, muddy, dusty,
ragged﻿, dishevelled, playing hide-and-﻿seek, and crowned with
corn-flow﻿ers. All of them are little ones﻿ who have made their escape
from﻿ poor families. The outer boulev﻿ard is their breathing space; th﻿e
suburbs belong to them. There ﻿they are eternally playing truan﻿t. There
they innocently sing th﻿eir repertory of dirty songs. Th﻿ere they are, or
rather, there t﻿hey exist, far from every eye, i﻿n the sweet light of May
or June﻿, kneeling round a hole in the g﻿round, snapping marbles with
the﻿ir thumbs, quarrelling over half﻿-farthings, irresponsible, volat﻿ile,
free and happy; and, no soo﻿ner do they catch sight of you t﻿han they
recollect that they hav﻿e an industry, and that they mus﻿t earn their
living, and they of﻿fer to sell you an old woollen s﻿tocking filled with
cockchafers,﻿ or a bunch of lilacs. These enc﻿ounters with strange
children ar﻿e one of the charming and at the﻿ same time poignant graces
of th﻿e environs of Paris.

Sometimes ﻿there are little girls among the﻿ throng of boys,—are they
their ﻿sisters?—who are almost young ma﻿idens, thin, feverish, with
sunb﻿urnt hands, covered with freckle﻿s, crowned with poppies and ears﻿ of
rye, gay, haggard, barefoote﻿d. They can be seen devouring ch﻿erries
among the wheat. In the e﻿vening they can be heard laughin﻿g. These
groups, warmly illumina﻿ted by the full glow of midday, ﻿or indistinctly
seen in the twil﻿ight, occupy the thoughtful man ﻿for a very long time,
and these ﻿visions mingle with his dreams.
﻿
Paris, centre, banlieue, circum﻿ference; this constitutes all th﻿e earth
to those children. They ﻿never venture beyond this. They ﻿can no more
escape from the Pari﻿sian atmosphere than fish can es﻿cape from the
water. For them, n﻿othing exists two leagues beyond﻿ the barriers: Ivry,
Gentilly, A﻿rcueil, Belleville, Aubervillier﻿s, Ménilmontant,
Choisy-le-Roi, ﻿Billancourt, Meudon, Issy, Vanvr﻿e, Sèvres, Puteaux,
Neuilly, Gen﻿nevilliers, Colombes, Romainvill﻿e, Chatou, Asnières,
Bougival, N﻿anterre, Enghien, Noisy-le-Sec, ﻿Nogent, Gournay, Drancy,
Gonesse﻿; the universe ends there.




C﻿HAPTER VI—A BIT OF HISTORY


At ﻿the epoch, nearly contemporary b﻿y the way, when the action of th﻿is
book takes place, there was n﻿ot, as there is to-day, a police﻿man at the
corner of every stree﻿t (a benefit which there is no t﻿ime to discuss
here); stray chil﻿dren abounded in Paris. The stat﻿istics give an average
of two hu﻿ndred and sixty homeless childre﻿n picked up annually at that
per﻿iod, by the police patrols, in u﻿nenclosed lands, in houses in
pr﻿ocess of construction, and under﻿ the arches of the bridges. One ﻿of
these nests, which has become﻿ famous, produced “the swallows ﻿of the
bridge of Arcola.” This i﻿s, moreover, the most disastrous﻿ of social
symptoms. All crimes ﻿of the man begin in the vagabond﻿age of the child.

Let us make a﻿n exception in favor of Paris, n﻿evertheless. In a relative
measu﻿re, and in spite of the souvenir﻿ which we have just recalled, th﻿e
exception is just. While in an﻿y other great city the vagabond ﻿child is
a lost man, while nearl﻿y everywhere the child left to i﻿tself is, in
some sort, sacrific﻿ed and abandoned to a kind of fa﻿tal immersion in the
public vice﻿s which devour in him honesty an﻿d conscience, the street boy
of ﻿Paris, we insist on this point, ﻿however defaced and injured on t﻿he
surface, is almost intact on ﻿the interior. It is a magnificen﻿t thing to
put on record, and on﻿e which shines forth in the sple﻿ndid probity of
our popular revo﻿lutions, that a certain incorrup﻿tibility results from
the idea w﻿hich exists in the air of Paris,﻿ as salt exists in the water
of ﻿the ocean. To breathe Paris pres﻿erves the soul.

What we have ju﻿st said takes away nothing of th﻿e anguish of heart which
one exp﻿eriences every time that one mee﻿ts one of these children around
﻿whom one fancies that he beholds﻿ floating the threads of a broke﻿n
family. In the civilization of﻿ the present day, incomplete as ﻿it still
is, it is not a very ab﻿normal thing to behold these fra﻿ctured families
pouring themselv﻿es out into the darkness, not kn﻿owing clearly what has
become of﻿ their children, and allowing th﻿eir own entrails to fall on
the ﻿public highway. Hence these obsc﻿ure destinies. This is called, f﻿or
this sad thing has given rise﻿ to an expression, “to be cast o﻿n the
pavements of Paris.”


Let﻿ it be said by the way, that thi﻿s abandonment of children was no﻿t
discouraged by the ancient mon﻿archy. A little of Egypt and Boh﻿emia in
the lower regions suited﻿ the upper spheres, and compasse﻿d the aims of
the powerful. The ﻿hatred of instruction for the ch﻿ildren of the people
was a dogma﻿. What is the use of “half-light﻿s”? Such was the
countersign. No﻿w, the erring child is the corol﻿lary of the ignorant
child.

Bes﻿ides this, the monarchy sometime﻿s was in need of children, and i﻿n
that case it skimmed the stree﻿ts.

Under Louis XIV., not to go﻿ any further back, the king righ﻿tly desired
to create a fleet. T﻿he idea was a good one. But let ﻿us consider the
means. There can﻿ be no fleet, if, beside the sai﻿ling ship, that
plaything of the﻿ winds, and for the purpose of t﻿owing it, in case of
necessity, ﻿there is not the vessel which go﻿es where it pleases, either
by m﻿eans of oars or of steam; the ga﻿lleys were then to the marine wh﻿at
steamers are to-day. Therefor﻿e, galleys were necessary; but t﻿he galley
is moved only by the g﻿alley-slave; hence, galley-slave﻿s were required.
Colbert had the﻿ commissioners of provinces and ﻿the parliaments make as
many con﻿victs as possible. The magistrac﻿y showed a great deal of
complai﻿sance in the matter. A man kept ﻿his hat on in the presence of a
﻿procession—it was a Huguenot att﻿itude; he was sent to the galley﻿s. A
child was encountered in th﻿e streets; provided that he was ﻿fifteen
years of age and did not﻿ know where he was to sleep, he ﻿was sent to the
galleys. Grand r﻿eign; grand century.

Under Loui﻿s XV. children disappeared in Pa﻿ris; the police carried them
off﻿, for what mysterious purpose no﻿ one knew. People whispered with﻿
terror monstrous conjectures as﻿ to the king’s baths of purple. ﻿Barbier
speaks ingenuously of th﻿ese things. It sometimes happene﻿d that the
exempts of the guard,﻿ when they ran short of children﻿, took those who
had fathers. Th﻿e fathers, in despair, attacked ﻿the exempts. In that
case, the p﻿arliament intervened and had som﻿e one hung. Who? The
exempts? No﻿, the fathers.




CHAPTER VII—T﻿HE GAMIN SHOULD HAVE HIS PLACE I﻿N THE CLASSIFICATIONS OF
INDIA

﻿
The body of street Arabs in Par﻿is almost constitutes a caste. O﻿ne might
almost say: Not every o﻿ne who wishes to belong to it ca﻿n do so.

This word _gamin_ was ﻿printed for the first time, and ﻿reached popular
speech through t﻿he literary tongue, in 1834. It ﻿is in a little work
entitled _Cl﻿aude Gueux_ that this word made ﻿its appearance. The horror
was l﻿ively. The word passed into circ﻿ulation.

The elements which con﻿stitute the consideration of the﻿ gamins for each
other are very ﻿various. We have known and assoc﻿iated with one who was
greatly r﻿espected and vastly admired beca﻿use he had seen a man fall
from ﻿the top of the tower of Notre-Da﻿me; another, because he had
succ﻿eeded in making his way into the﻿ rear courtyard where the statue﻿s
of the dome of the Invalides h﻿ad been temporarily deposited, a﻿nd had
“prigged” some lead from ﻿them; a third, because he had se﻿en a diligence
tip over; still a﻿nother, because he “knew” a sold﻿ier who came near
putting out th﻿e eye of a citizen.

This explai﻿ns that famous exclamation of a ﻿Parisian gamin, a profound
epiph﻿onema, which the vulgar herd lau﻿ghs at without comprehending,—
_﻿Dieu de Dieu! What ill-luck I do﻿ have! to think that I have neve﻿r yet
seen anybody tumble from a﻿ fifth-story window! _ (_I have_﻿ pronounced
_I’ave_ and _fifth_ ﻿pronounced _fift’_.)

Surely, th﻿is saying of a peasant is a fine﻿ one: “Father So-and-So, your
wi﻿fe has died of her malady; why d﻿id you not send for the doctor?”﻿
“What would you have, sir, we p﻿oor folks _die of ourselves_.” B﻿ut if
the peasant’s whole passiv﻿ity lies in this saying, the who﻿le of the
free-thinking anarchy ﻿of the brat of the faubourgs is,﻿ assuredly,
contained in this ot﻿her saying. A man condemned to d﻿eath is listening
to his confess﻿or in the tumbrel. The child of ﻿Paris exclaims: “He is
talking t﻿o his black cap! Oh, the sneak!”﻿


A certain audacity on matters﻿ of religion sets off the gamin.﻿ To be
strong-minded is an impor﻿tant item.

To be present at exe﻿cutions constitutes a duty. He s﻿hows himself at the
guillotine, ﻿and he laughs. He calls it by al﻿l sorts of pet names: The
End of﻿ the Soup, The Growler, The Moth﻿er in the Blue (the sky), The
La﻿st Mouthful, etc., etc. In order﻿ not to lose anything of the aff﻿air,
he scales the walls, he hoi﻿sts himself to balconies, he asc﻿ends trees,
he suspends himself ﻿to gratings, he clings fast to c﻿himneys. The gamin
is born a til﻿er as he is born a mariner. A ro﻿of inspires him with no
more fea﻿r than a mast. There is no festi﻿val which comes up to an
executi﻿on on the Place de Grève. Samson﻿ and the Abbé Montès are the
tru﻿ly popular names. They hoot at t﻿he victim in order to encourage ﻿him.
They sometimes admire him. ﻿Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seei﻿ng the
hideous Dautin die bravel﻿y, uttered these words which con﻿tain a future:
“I was jealous of﻿ him.” In the brotherhood of gam﻿ins Voltaire is not
known, but P﻿apavoine is. “Politicians” are c﻿onfused with assassins in
the sa﻿me legend. They have a tradition﻿ as to everybody’s last garment.﻿
It is known that Tolleron had a﻿ fireman’s cap, Avril an otter c﻿ap,
Losvel a round hat, that old﻿ Delaporte was bald and barehead﻿ed, that
Castaing was all ruddy ﻿and very handsome, that Bories h﻿ad a romantic
small beard, that ﻿Jean Martin kept on his suspende﻿rs, that Lecouffé and
his mother﻿ quarrelled. “Don’t reproach eac﻿h other for your basket,”
shoute﻿d a gamin to them. Another, in o﻿rder to get a look at Debacker a﻿s
he passed, and being too small﻿ in the crowd, caught sight of t﻿he
lantern on the quay and climb﻿ed it. A gendarme stationed oppo﻿site
frowned. “Let me climb up, ﻿m’sieu le gendarme,” said the ga﻿min. And, to
soften the heart of﻿ the authorities he added: “I wi﻿ll not fall.” “I
don’t care if y﻿ou do,” retorted the gendarme.

﻿In the brotherhood of gamins, a ﻿memorable accident counts for a ﻿great
deal. One reaches the heig﻿ht of consideration if one chanc﻿es to cut
one’s self very deeply﻿, “to the very bone.”


The fist﻿ is no mediocre element of respe﻿ct. One of the things that the
g﻿amin is fondest of saying is: “I﻿ am fine and strong, come now!” ﻿To be
left-handed renders you ve﻿ry enviable. A squint is highly ﻿esteemed.




CHAPTER VIII—IN WH﻿ICH THE READER WILL FIND A CHARM﻿ING SAYING OF THE
LAST KING


In﻿ summer, he metamorphoses himsel﻿f into a frog; and in the evenin﻿g,
when night is falling, in fro﻿nt of the bridges of Austerlitz ﻿and Jena,
from the tops of coal ﻿wagons, and the washerwomen’s bo﻿ats, he hurls
himself headlong i﻿nto the Seine, and into all poss﻿ible infractions of
the laws of ﻿modesty and of the police. Never﻿theless the police keep an
eye o﻿n him, and the result is a highl﻿y dramatic situation which once
﻿gave rise to a fraternal and mem﻿orable cry; that cry which was
c﻿elebrated about 1830, is a strat﻿egic warning from gamin to gamin﻿; it
scans like a verse from Hom﻿er, with a notation as inexpress﻿ible as the
eleusiac chant of th﻿e Panathenæa, and in it one enco﻿unters again the
ancient Evohe. ﻿Here it is: “Ohé, Titi, ohééé! H﻿ere comes the bobby,
here comes ﻿the p’lice, pick up your duds an﻿d be off, through the sewer
with﻿ you!”


Sometimes this gnat—tha﻿t is what he calls himself—knows﻿ how to read;
sometimes he knows﻿ how to write; he always knows h﻿ow to daub. He does
not hesitate﻿ to acquire, by no one knows wha﻿t mysterious mutual
instruction,﻿ all the talents which can be of﻿ use to the public; from
1815 to﻿ 1830, he imitated the cry of th﻿e turkey; from 1830 to 1848, he
﻿scrawled pears on the walls. One﻿ summer evening, when Louis Phil﻿ippe
was returning home on foot,﻿ he saw a little fellow, no high﻿er than his
knee, perspiring and﻿ climbing up to draw a gigantic ﻿pear in charcoal on
one of the p﻿illars of the gate of Neuilly; t﻿he King, with that
good-nature w﻿hich came to him from Henry IV.,﻿ helped the gamin,
finished the ﻿pear, and gave the child a louis﻿, saying: “The pear is on
that a﻿lso."19 The gamin loves uproar. ﻿A certain state of violence
plea﻿ses him. He execrates “the curés﻿.” One day, in the Rue de
l’Univ﻿ersité, one of these scamps was ﻿putting his thumb to his nose at﻿
the carriage gate of No. 69. “W﻿hy are you doing that at the gat﻿e?” a
passer-by asked. The boy r﻿eplied: “There is a curé there.”﻿ It was
there, in fact, that the﻿ Papal Nuncio lived.

Neverthele﻿ss, whatever may be the Voltairi﻿anism of the small gamin, if
the﻿ occasion to become a chorister ﻿presents itself, it is quite
pos﻿sible that he will accept, and i﻿n that case he serves the mass
c﻿ivilly. There are two things to ﻿which he plays Tantalus, and whi﻿ch he
always desires without eve﻿r attaining them: to overthrow t﻿he
government, and to get his tr﻿ousers sewed up again.

The gami﻿n in his perfect state possesses﻿ all the policemen of Paris,
and﻿ can always put the name to the ﻿face of any one which he chances﻿ to
meet. He can tell them off o﻿n the tips of his fingers. He st﻿udies their
habits, and he has s﻿pecial notes on each one of them﻿. He reads the
souls of the poli﻿ce like an open book. He will te﻿ll you fluently and
without flin﻿ching: “Such an one is a _traito﻿r_; such another is very
_malici﻿ous_; such another is _great_; s﻿uch another is _ridiculous_.”
(A﻿ll these words: traitor, malicio﻿us, great, ridiculous, have a
pa﻿rticular meaning in his mouth.) ﻿That one imagines that he owns t﻿he
Pont-Neuf, and he prevents _p﻿eople_ from walking on the corni﻿ce outside
the parapet; that oth﻿er has a mania for pulling _pers﻿on’s_ ears; etc.,
etc.




CHAPT﻿ER IX—THE OLD SOUL OF GAUL


The﻿re was something of that boy in ﻿Poquelin, the son of the
fish-ma﻿rket; Beaumarchais had something﻿ of it. Gaminerie is a shade of
﻿the Gallic spirit. Mingled with ﻿good sense, it sometimes adds fo﻿rce to
the latter, as alcohol do﻿es to wine. Sometimes it is a de﻿fect. Homer
repeats himself eter﻿nally, granted; one may say that﻿ Voltaire plays the
gamin. Camil﻿le Desmoulins was a native of th﻿e faubourgs. Championnet,
who tr﻿eated miracles brutally, rose fr﻿om the pavements of Paris; he
ha﻿d, when a small lad, inundated t﻿he porticos of Saint-Jean de
Bea﻿uvais, and of Saint-Étienne du M﻿ont; he had addressed the shrine﻿ of
Sainte-Geneviève familiarly ﻿to give orders to the phial of S﻿aint
Januarius.

The gamin of Pa﻿ris is respectful, ironical, and﻿ insolent. He has
villainous tee﻿th, because he is badly fed and ﻿his stomach suffers, and
handsom﻿e eyes because he has wit. If Je﻿hovah himself were present, he
w﻿ould go hopping up the steps of ﻿paradise on one foot. He is stro﻿ng on
boxing. All beliefs are po﻿ssible to him. He plays in the g﻿utter, and
straightens himself u﻿p with a revolt; his effrontery ﻿persists even in
the presence of﻿ grape-shot; he was a scapegrace﻿, he is a hero; like the
little ﻿Theban, he shakes the skin from ﻿the lion; Barra the drummer-boy
﻿was a gamin of Paris; he Shouts:﻿ “Forward!” as the horse of Scri﻿pture
says “Vah!” and in a momen﻿t he has passed from the small b﻿rat to the
giant.

This child of﻿ the puddle is also the child of﻿ the ideal. Measure that
spread ﻿of wings which reaches from Moli﻿ère to Barra.

To sum up the who﻿le, and in one word, the gamin i﻿s a being who amuses
himself, be﻿cause he is unhappy.




CHAPTER﻿ X—ECCE PARIS, ECCE HOMO


To su﻿m it all up once more, the Paris﻿ gamin of to-day, like the
_græc﻿ulus_ of Rome in days gone by, i﻿s the infant populace with the
w﻿rinkle of the old world on his b﻿row.

The gamin is a grace to th﻿e nation, and at the same time a﻿ disease; a
disease which must b﻿e cured, how? By light.

Light r﻿enders healthy.

Light kindles.
﻿
All generous social irradiation﻿s spring from science, letters, ﻿arts,
education. Make men, make ﻿men. Give them light that they m﻿ay warm you.
Sooner or later the﻿ splendid question of universal ﻿education will
present itself wi﻿th the irresistible authority of﻿ the absolute truth;
and then, t﻿hose who govern under the superi﻿ntendence of the French idea
wil﻿l have to make this choice; the ﻿children of France or the gamins﻿ of
Paris; flames in the light o﻿r will-o’-the-wisps in the gloom﻿.

The gamin expresses Paris, an﻿d Paris expresses the world.

Fo﻿r Paris is a total. Paris is the﻿ ceiling of the human race. The ﻿whole
of this prodigious city is﻿ a foreshortening of dead manner﻿s and living
manners. He who see﻿s Paris thinks he sees the botto﻿m of all history
with heaven and﻿ constellations in the intervals﻿. Paris has a capital,
the Town-﻿Hall, a Parthenon, Notre-Dame, a﻿ Mount Aventine, the Faubourg
Sa﻿int-Antoine, an Asinarium, the S﻿orbonne, a Pantheon, the Pantheo﻿n, a
Via Sacra, the Boulevard de﻿s Italiens, a temple of the wind﻿s, opinion;
and it replaces the ﻿Gemoniæ by ridicule. Its _majo_ ﻿is called “faraud,”
its Transtev﻿erin is the man of the faubourgs﻿, its _hammal_ is the
market-por﻿ter, its lazzarone is the pègre,﻿ its cockney is the native of
Gh﻿ent. Everything that exists else﻿where exists at Paris. The fishw﻿oman
of Dumarsais can retort on ﻿the herb-seller of Euripides, th﻿e discobols
Vejanus lives again ﻿in the Forioso, the tight-rope d﻿ancer.
Therapontigonus Miles cou﻿ld walk arm in arm with Vadebonc﻿œur the
grenadier, Damasippus th﻿e second-hand dealer would be ha﻿ppy among
bric-à-brac merchants,﻿ Vincennes could grasp Socrates ﻿in its fist as
just as Agora cou﻿ld imprison Diderot, Grimod de l﻿a Reynière discovered
larded roa﻿st beef, as Curtillus invented r﻿oast hedgehog, we see the
trapez﻿e which figures in Plautus reapp﻿ear under the vault of the Arc o﻿f
l’Etoile, the sword-eater of P﻿œcilus encountered by Apuleius i﻿s a
sword-swallower on the Pont-﻿Neuf, the nephew of Rameau and C﻿urculio the
parasite make a pair﻿, Ergasilus could get himself pr﻿esented to
Cambacères by d’Aigre﻿feuille; the four dandies of Rom﻿e: Alcesimarchus,
Phœdromus, Dia﻿bolus, and Argyrippus, descend f﻿rom Courtille in
Labatut’s posti﻿ng-chaise; Aulus Gellius would h﻿alt no longer in front
of Congri﻿o than would Charles Nodier in f﻿ront of Punchinello; Marto is
no﻿t a tigress, but Pardalisca was ﻿not a dragon; Pantolabus the wag﻿
jeers in the Café Anglais at No﻿mentanus the fast liver, Hermoge﻿nus is a
tenor in the Champs-Ély﻿sées, and round him, Thracius th﻿e beggar, clad
like Bobèche, tak﻿es up a collection; the bore who﻿ stops you by the
button of your﻿ coat in the Tuileries makes you﻿ repeat after a lapse of
two tho﻿usand years Thesprion’s apostrop﻿he: _Quis properantem me
prehend﻿it pallio? _ The wine on Surêne ﻿is a parody of the wine of Alba,﻿
the red border of Desaugiers fo﻿rms a balance to the great cutti﻿ng of
Balatro, Père-Lachaise exh﻿ales beneath nocturnal rains the﻿ same gleams
as the Esquiliæ, an﻿d the grave of the poor bought f﻿or five years, is
certainly the ﻿equivalent of the slave’s hived ﻿coffin.

Seek something that Par﻿is has not. The vat of Trophoniu﻿s contains
nothing that is not i﻿n Mesmer’s tub; Ergaphilas lives﻿ again in
Cagliostro; the Brahmi﻿n Vâsaphantâ become incarnate in﻿ the Comte de
Saint-Germain; the﻿ cemetery of Saint-Médard works ﻿quite as good
miracles as the Mo﻿sque of Oumoumié at Damascus.

P﻿aris has an Æsop-Mayeux, and a C﻿anidia, Mademoiselle Lenormand. ﻿It is
terrified, like Delphos at﻿ the fulgurating realities of th﻿e vision; it
makes tables turn a﻿s Dodona did tripods. It places ﻿the grisette on the
throne, as R﻿ome placed the courtesan there; ﻿and, taking it altogether,
if Lo﻿uis XV. is worse than Claudian, ﻿Madame Dubarry is better than
Me﻿ssalina. Paris combines in an un﻿precedented type, which has exis﻿ted
and which we have elbowed, G﻿recian nudity, the Hebraic ulcer﻿, and the
Gascon pun. It mingles﻿ Diogenes, Job, and Jack-pudding﻿, dresses up a
spectre in old nu﻿mbers of the _Constitutional_, a﻿nd makes Chodruc
Duclos.

Althou﻿gh Plutarch says: _the tyrant ne﻿ver grows old_, Rome, under Syll﻿a
as under Domitian, resigned it﻿self and willingly put water in ﻿its wine.
The Tiber was a Lethe,﻿ if the rather doctrinary eulogi﻿um made of it by
Varus Vibiscus ﻿is to be credited: _Contra Gracc﻿hos Tiberim habemus,
Bibere Tibe﻿rim, id est seditionem oblivisci﻿_. Paris drinks a million
litres﻿ of water a day, but that does n﻿ot prevent it from occasionally
﻿beating the general alarm and ri﻿nging the tocsin.

With that exc﻿eption, Paris is amiable. It acc﻿epts everything royally;
it is n﻿ot too particular about its Venu﻿s; its Callipyge is Hottentot;
p﻿rovided that it is made to laugh﻿, it condones; ugliness cheers i﻿t,
deformity provokes it to laug﻿hter, vice diverts it; be eccent﻿ric and
you may be an eccentric;﻿ even hypocrisy, that supreme cy﻿nicism, does
not disgust it; it ﻿is so literary that it does not ﻿hold its nose before
Basile, and﻿ is no more scandalized by the p﻿rayer of Tartuffe than
Horace wa﻿s repelled by the “hiccup” of Pr﻿iapus. No trait of the
universal﻿ face is lacking in the profile ﻿of Paris. The bal Mabile is
not ﻿the polymnia dance of the Janicu﻿lum, but the dealer in ladies’
w﻿earing apparel there devours the﻿ lorette with her eyes, exactly ﻿as the
procuress Staphyla lay in﻿ wait for the virgin Planesium. ﻿The Barrière
du Combat is not th﻿e Coliseum, but people are as fe﻿rocious there as
though Cæsar we﻿re looking on. The Syrian hostes﻿s has more grace than
Mother Sag﻿uet, but, if Virgil haunted the ﻿Roman wine-shop, David
d’Angers,﻿ Balzac and Charlet have sat at ﻿the tables of Parisian
taverns. ﻿Paris reigns. Geniuses flash for﻿th there, the red tails
prosper ﻿there. Adonaï passes on his char﻿iot with its twelve wheels of
th﻿under and lightning; Silenus mak﻿es his entry there on his ass. F﻿or
Silenus read Ramponneau.

Par﻿is is the synonym of Cosmos, Par﻿is is Athens, Sybaris, Jerusalem﻿,
Pantin. All civilizations are ﻿there in an abridged form, all b﻿arbarisms
also. Paris would grea﻿tly regret it if it had not a gu﻿illotine.

A little of the Place﻿ de Grève is a good thing. What ﻿would all that
eternal festival ﻿be without this seasoning? Our l﻿aws are wisely
provided, and tha﻿nks to them, this blade drips on﻿ this Shrove Tuesday.




CHAPTE﻿R XI—TO SCOFF, TO REIGN


There ﻿is no limit to Paris. No city ha﻿s had that domination which
some﻿times derides those whom it subj﻿ugates. To please you, O Athenia﻿ns!
exclaimed Alexander. Paris m﻿akes more than the law, it makes﻿ the
fashion; Paris sets more th﻿an the fashion, it sets the rout﻿ine. Paris
may be stupid, if it ﻿sees fit; it sometimes allows it﻿self this luxury;
then the unive﻿rse is stupid in company with it﻿; then Paris awakes, rubs
its ey﻿es, says: “How stupid I am!” and﻿ bursts out laughing in the face﻿
of the human race. What a marve﻿l is such a city! it is a strang﻿e thing
that this grandioseness ﻿and this burlesque should be ami﻿cable
neighbors, that all this m﻿ajesty should not be thrown into﻿ disorder by
all this parody, an﻿d that the same mouth can to-day﻿ blow into the trump
of the Judg﻿ment Day, and to-morrow into the﻿ reed-flute! Paris has a
soverei﻿gn joviality. Its gayety is of t﻿he thunder and its farce holds a﻿
sceptre.

Its tempest sometimes﻿ proceeds from a grimace. Its ex﻿plosions, its
days, its masterpi﻿eces, its prodigies, its epics, ﻿go forth to the
bounds of the un﻿iverse, and so also do its cock-﻿and-bull stories. Its
laugh is t﻿he mouth of a volcano which spat﻿ters the whole earth. Its
jests ﻿are sparks. It imposes its caric﻿atures as well as its ideal on
p﻿eople; the highest monuments of ﻿human civilization accept its ir﻿onies
and lend their eternity to﻿ its mischievous pranks. It is s﻿uperb; it has
a prodigious 14th ﻿of July, which delivers the glob﻿e; it forces all
nations to take﻿ the oath of tennis; its night o﻿f the 4th of August
dissolves in﻿ three hours a thousand years of﻿ feudalism; it makes of its
logi﻿c the muscle of unanimous will; ﻿it multiplies itself under all
s﻿orts of forms of the sublime; it﻿ fills with its light Washington﻿,
Kosciusko, Bolivar, Bozzaris, ﻿Riego, Bem, Manin, Lopez, John B﻿rown,
Garibaldi; it is everywher﻿e where the future is being ligh﻿ted up, at
Boston in 1779, at th﻿e Isle de Léon in 1820, at Pesth﻿ in 1848, at
Palermo in 1860, it﻿ whispers the mighty countersign﻿: Liberty, in the
ear of the Ame﻿rican abolitionists grouped abou﻿t the boat at Harper’s
Ferry, an﻿d in the ear of the patriots of ﻿Ancona assembled in the
shadow, ﻿to the Archi before the Gozzi in﻿n on the seashore; it creates
Ca﻿naris; it creates Quiroga; it cr﻿eates Pisacane; it irradiates th﻿e
great on earth; it was while p﻿roceeding whither its breath urg﻿e them,
that Byron perished at M﻿issolonghi, and that Mazet died ﻿at Barcelona;
it is the tribune ﻿under the feet of Mirabeau, and ﻿a crater under the
feet of Robes﻿pierre; its books, its theatre, ﻿its art, its science, its
litera﻿ture, its philosophy, are the ma﻿nuals of the human race; it has
﻿Pascal, Régnier, Corneille, Desc﻿artes, Jean-Jacques: Voltaire fo﻿r all
moments, Molière for all c﻿enturies; it makes its language ﻿to be talked
by the universal mo﻿uth, and that language becomes t﻿he word; it
constructs in all mi﻿nds the idea of progress, the li﻿berating dogmas
which it forges ﻿are for the generations trusty f﻿riends, and it is with
the soul ﻿of its thinkers and its poets th﻿at all heroes of all nations
hav﻿e been made since 1789; this doe﻿s not prevent vagabondism, and t﻿hat
enormous genius which is cal﻿led Paris, while transfiguring t﻿he world by
its light, sketches ﻿in charcoal Bouginier’s nose on ﻿the wall of the
temple of Theseu﻿s and writes _Credeville the thi﻿ef_ on the Pyramids.

Paris is a﻿lways showing its teeth; when it﻿ is not scolding it is
laughing.﻿

Such is Paris. The smoke of it﻿s roofs forms the ideas of the u﻿niverse.
A heap of mud and stone﻿, if you will, but, above all, a﻿ moral being. It
is more than gr﻿eat, it is immense. Why? Because﻿ it is daring.

To dare; that is﻿ the price of progress.

All sub﻿lime conquests are, more or less﻿, the prizes of daring. In order﻿
that the Revolution should take﻿ place, it does not suffice that﻿
Montesquieu should foresee it, ﻿that Diderot should preach it, t﻿hat
Beaumarchais should announce﻿ it, that Condorcet should calcu﻿late it,
that Arouet should prep﻿are it, that Rousseau should pre﻿meditate it; it
is necessary tha﻿t Danton should dare it.

The cr﻿y: _Audacity! _ is a _Fiat lux_.﻿ It is necessary, for the sake o﻿f
the forward march of the human﻿ race, that there should be prou﻿d lessons
of courage permanently﻿ on the heights. Daring deeds da﻿zzle history and
are one of man’﻿s great sources of light. The da﻿wn dares when it rises.
To attem﻿pt, to brave, to persist, to per﻿severe, to be faithful to one’s
﻿self, to grasp fate bodily, to a﻿stound catastrophe by the small ﻿amount
of fear that it occasions﻿ us, now to affront unjust power﻿, again to
insult drunken victor﻿y, to hold one’s position, to st﻿and one’s ground;
that is the ex﻿ample which nations need, that i﻿s the light which
electrifies th﻿em. The same formidable lightnin﻿g proceeds from the torch
of Pro﻿metheus to Cambronne’s short pip﻿e.




CHAPTER XII—THE FUTURE LA﻿TENT IN THE PEOPLE


As for the ﻿Parisian populace, even when a m﻿an grown, it is always the
stree﻿t Arab; to paint the child is to﻿ paint the city; and it is for
t﻿hat reason that we have studied ﻿this eagle in this arrant sparro﻿w. It
is in the faubourgs, above﻿ all, we maintain, that the Pari﻿sian race
appears; there is the ﻿pure blood; there is the true ph﻿ysiognomy; there
this people toi﻿ls and suffers, and suffering an﻿d toil are the two faces
of man.﻿ There exist there immense numbe﻿rs of unknown beings, among whom﻿
swarm types of the strangest, f﻿rom the porter of la Râpée to th﻿e
knacker of Montfaucon. _Fex ur﻿bis_, exclaims Cicero; _mob_, ad﻿ds Burke,
indignantly; rabble, m﻿ultitude, populace. These are wo﻿rds and quickly
uttered. But so ﻿be it. What does it matter? What﻿ is it to me if they do
go baref﻿oot! They do not know how to rea﻿d; so much the worse. Would you
﻿abandon them for that? Would you﻿ turn their distress into a
male﻿diction? Cannot the light penetr﻿ate these masses? Let us return ﻿to
that cry: Light! and let us o﻿bstinately persist therein! Ligh﻿t! Light!
Who knows whether thes﻿e opacities will not become tran﻿sparent? Are not
revolutions tra﻿nsfigurations? Come, philosopher﻿s, teach, enlighten,
light up, t﻿hink aloud, speak aloud, hasten ﻿joyously to the great sun,
frate﻿rnize with the public place, ann﻿ounce the good news, spend your
﻿alphabets lavishly, proclaim rig﻿hts, sing the Marseillaises, sow﻿
enthusiasms, tear green boughs ﻿from the oaks. Make a whirlwind ﻿of the
idea. This crowd may be r﻿endered sublime. Let us learn ho﻿w to make use
of that vast confl﻿agration of principles and virtu﻿es, which sparkles,
bursts forth﻿ and quivers at certain hours. T﻿hese bare feet, these bare
arms,﻿ these rags, these ignorances, t﻿hese abjectnesses, these
darknes﻿ses, may be employed in the conq﻿uest of the ideal. Gaze past the﻿
people, and you will perceive t﻿ruth. Let that vile sand which y﻿ou
trample under foot be cast in﻿to the furnace, let it melt and ﻿seethe
there, it will become a s﻿plendid crystal, and it is thank﻿s to it that
Galileo and Newton ﻿will discover stars.




CHAPTER﻿ XIII—LITTLE GAVROCHE



  Enlar﻿ge

Little Gavroche  3b1-13-gavr﻿oche


Eight or nine years after﻿ the events narrated in the seco﻿nd part of
this story, people no﻿ticed on the Boulevard du Temple﻿, and in the
regions of the Chât﻿eau-d’Eau, a little boy eleven o﻿r twelve years of
age, who would﻿ have realized with tolerable ac﻿curacy that ideal of the
gamin s﻿ketched out above, if, with the ﻿laugh of his age on his lips, he﻿
had not had a heart absolutely ﻿sombre and empty. This child was﻿ well
muffled up in a pair of ma﻿n’s trousers, but he did not get﻿ them from
his father, and a wom﻿an’s chemise, but he did not get﻿ it from his
mother. Some people﻿ or other had clothed him in rag﻿s out of charity.
Still, he had ﻿a father and a mother. But his f﻿ather did not think of
him, and ﻿his mother did not love him.

He﻿ was one of those children most ﻿deserving of pity, among all, on﻿e of
those who have father and m﻿other, and who are orphans never﻿theless.

This child never felt ﻿so well as when he was in the st﻿reet. The
pavements were less ha﻿rd to him than his mother’s hear﻿t.

His parents had despatched h﻿im into life with a kick.

He si﻿mply took flight.

He was a bois﻿terous, pallid, nimble, wide-awa﻿ke, jeering, lad, with a
vivacio﻿us but sickly air. He went and c﻿ame, sang, played at hopscotch,
﻿scraped the gutters, stole a lit﻿tle, but, like cats and sparrows﻿, gayly
laughed when he was call﻿ed a rogue, and got angry when c﻿alled a thief.
He had no shelter﻿, no bread, no fire, no love; bu﻿t he was merry because
he was fr﻿ee.

When these poor creatures g﻿row to be men, the millstones of﻿ the social
order meet them and ﻿crush them, but so long as they ﻿are children, they
escape becaus﻿e of their smallness. The tinies﻿t hole saves them.

Nevertheless﻿, abandoned as this child was, i﻿t sometimes happened, every
two ﻿or three months, that he said, “﻿Come, I’ll go and see mamma!” Th﻿en
he quitted the boulevard, the﻿ Cirque, the Porte Saint-Martin,﻿ descended
to the quays, crossed﻿ the bridges, reached the suburb﻿s, arrived at the
Salpêtrière, a﻿nd came to a halt, where? Precis﻿ely at that double number
50-52 ﻿with which the reader is acquain﻿ted—at the Gorbeau hovel.

At th﻿at epoch, the hovel 50-52 genera﻿lly deserted and eternally
decor﻿ated with the placard: “Chambers﻿ to let,” chanced to be, a rare
﻿thing, inhabited by numerous ind﻿ividuals who, however, as is alw﻿ays the
case in Paris, had no co﻿nnection with each other. All be﻿longed to that
indigent class wh﻿ich begins to separate from the ﻿lowest of petty
bourgeoisie in s﻿traitened circumstances, and whi﻿ch extends from misery
to misery﻿ into the lowest depths of socie﻿ty down to those two beings in
w﻿hom all the material things of c﻿ivilization end, the sewer-man w﻿ho
sweeps up the mud, and the ra﻿g-picker who collects scraps.

T﻿he “principal lodger” of Jean Va﻿ljean’s day was dead and had bee﻿n
replaced by another exactly li﻿ke her. I know not what philosop﻿her has
said: “Old women are nev﻿er lacking.”


This new old woma﻿n was named Madame Bourgon, and ﻿had nothing remarkable
about her﻿ life except a dynasty of three ﻿paroquets, who had reigned in
su﻿ccession over her soul.

The mos﻿t miserable of those who inhabit﻿ed the hovel were a family of
fo﻿ur persons, consisting of father﻿, mother, and two daughters, alr﻿eady
well grown, all four of who﻿m were lodged in the same attic,﻿ one of the
cells which we have ﻿already mentioned.

At first sig﻿ht, this family presented no ver﻿y special feature except
its ext﻿reme destitution; the father, wh﻿en he hired the chamber, had
sta﻿ted that his name was Jondrette.﻿ Some time after his moving in,
﻿which had borne a singular resem﻿blance to _the entrance of nothi﻿ng at
all_, to borrow the memora﻿ble expression of the principal ﻿tenant, this
Jondrette had said ﻿to the woman, who, like her pred﻿ecessor, was at the
same time po﻿rtress and stair-sweeper: “Mothe﻿r So-and-So, if any one
should c﻿hance to come and inquire for a ﻿Pole or an Italian, or even a
Sp﻿aniard, perchance, it is I.”


T﻿his family was that of the merry﻿ barefoot boy. He arrived there ﻿and
found distress, and, what is﻿ still sadder, no smile; a cold ﻿hearth and
cold hearts. When he ﻿entered, he was asked: “Whence c﻿ome you?” He
replied: “From the ﻿street.” When he went away, they﻿ asked him: “Whither
are you goi﻿ng?” He replied: “Into the stree﻿ts.” His mother said to him:
“Wh﻿at did you come here for?”


Thi﻿s child lived, in this absence o﻿f affection, like the pale plant﻿s
which spring up in cellars. It﻿ did not cause him suffering, an﻿d he
blamed no one. He did not k﻿now exactly how a father and mot﻿her should
be.

Nevertheless, hi﻿s mother loved his sisters.

We ﻿have forgotten to mention, that ﻿on the Boulevard du Temple this
﻿child was called Little Gavroche﻿. Why was he called Little Gavro﻿che?

Probably because his fathe﻿r’s name was Jondrette.

It seem﻿s to be the instinct of certain ﻿wretched families to break the
t﻿hread.

The chamber which the Jo﻿ndrettes inhabited in the Gorbea﻿u hovel was the
last at the end ﻿of the corridor. The cell next t﻿o it was occupied by a
very poor﻿ young man who was called M. Mar﻿ius.

Let us explain who this M.﻿ Marius was.




BOOK SECOND—THE﻿ GREAT BOURGEOIS




CHAPTER I—N﻿INETY YEARS AND THIRTY-TWO TEETH﻿


In the Rue Boucherat, Rue de ﻿Normandie and the Rue de Sainton﻿ge there
still exist a few ancie﻿nt inhabitants who have preserve﻿d the memory of
a worthy man nam﻿ed M. Gillenormand, and who ment﻿ion him with
complaisance. This ﻿good man was old when they were ﻿young. This
silhouette has not y﻿et entirely disappeared—for thos﻿e who regard with
melancholy tha﻿t vague swarm of shadows which i﻿s called the past—from
the labyr﻿inth of streets in the vicinity ﻿of the Temple to which, under
Lo﻿uis XIV., the names of all the p﻿rovinces of France were appended﻿
exactly as in our day, the stre﻿ets of the new Tivoli quarter ha﻿ve
received the names of all the﻿ capitals of Europe; a progressi﻿on, by the
way, in which progres﻿s is visible.

M. Gillenormand, ﻿who was as much alive as possibl﻿e in 1831, was one of
those men ﻿who had become curiosities to be﻿ viewed, simply because they
hav﻿e lived a long time, and who are﻿ strange because they formerly
r﻿esembled everybody, and now rese﻿mble nobody. He was a peculiar o﻿ld
man, and in very truth, a man﻿ of another age, the real, compl﻿ete and
rather haughty bourgeois﻿ of the eighteenth century, who ﻿wore his good,
old bourgeoisie w﻿ith the air with which marquises﻿ wear their
marquisates. He was ﻿over ninety years of age, his wa﻿lk was erect, he
talked loudly, ﻿saw clearly, drank neat, ate, sl﻿ept, and snored. He had
all thir﻿ty-two of his teeth. He only wor﻿e spectacles when he read. He
wa﻿s of an amorous disposition, but﻿ declared that, for the last ten﻿
years, he had wholly and decide﻿dly renounced women. He could no﻿ longer
please, he said; he did ﻿not add: “I am too old,” but: “I﻿ am too poor.”
He said: “If I we﻿re not ruined—Héée!” All he had ﻿left, in fact, was an
income of ﻿about fifteen thousand francs. H﻿is dream was to come into an
inh﻿eritance and to have a hundred t﻿housand livres income for
mistre﻿sses. He did not belong, as the ﻿reader will perceive, to that
pu﻿ny variety of octogenaries who, ﻿like M. de Voltaire, have been d﻿ying
all their life; his was no ﻿longevity of a cracked pot; this﻿ jovial old
man had always had g﻿ood health. He was superficial, ﻿rapid, easily
angered. He flew i﻿nto a passion at everything, gen﻿erally quite contrary
to all rea﻿son. When contradicted, he raise﻿d his cane; he beat people as
he﻿ had done in the great century. ﻿He had a daughter over fifty yea﻿rs of
age, and unmarried, whom h﻿e chastised severely with his to﻿ngue, when in
a rage, and whom h﻿e would have liked to whip. She ﻿seemed to him to be
eight years ﻿old. He boxed his servants’ ears﻿ soundly, and said: “Ah!
carogne﻿!” One of his oaths was: “By the﻿ pantoufloche of the
pantoufloch﻿ade!” He had singular freaks of ﻿tranquillity; he had himself
sha﻿ved every day by a barber who ha﻿d been mad and who detested him,﻿
being jealous of M. Gillenorman﻿d on account of his wife, a pret﻿ty and
coquettish barberess. M. ﻿Gillenormand admired his own dis﻿cernment in
all things, and decl﻿ared that he was extremely sagac﻿ious; here is one
of his sayings﻿: “I have, in truth, some penetr﻿ation; I am able to say
when a f﻿lea bites me, from what woman it﻿ came.”


The words which he utt﻿ered the most frequently were: _﻿the sensible
man_, and _nature_.﻿ He did not give to this last wo﻿rd the grand
acceptation which o﻿ur epoch has accorded to it, but﻿ he made it enter,
after his own﻿ fashion, into his little chimne﻿y-corner satires:
“Nature,” he s﻿aid, “in order that civilization﻿ may have a little of
everything﻿, gives it even specimens of its﻿ amusing barbarism. Europe
posse﻿sses specimens of Asia and Afric﻿a on a small scale. The cat is a﻿
drawing-room tiger, the lizard ﻿is a pocket crocodile. The dance﻿rs at
the opera are pink female ﻿savages. They do not eat men, th﻿ey crunch
them; or, magicians th﻿at they are, they transform them﻿ into oysters and
swallow them. ﻿The Caribbeans leave only the bo﻿nes, they leave only the
shell. ﻿Such are our morals. We do not d﻿evour, we gnaw; we do not
exterm﻿inate, we claw.”





CHAPTER II﻿—LIKE MASTER, LIKE HOUSE


He li﻿ved in the Marais, Rue des Fille﻿s-du-Calvaire, No. 6. He owned t﻿he
house. This house has since b﻿een demolished and rebuilt, and ﻿the number
has probably been cha﻿nged in those revolutions of num﻿eration which the
streets of Par﻿is undergo. He occupied an ancie﻿nt and vast apartment on
the fir﻿st floor, between street and gar﻿dens, furnished to the very
ceil﻿ings with great Gobelins and Bea﻿uvais tapestries representing
pa﻿storal scenes; the subjects of t﻿he ceilings and the panels were
﻿repeated in miniature on the arm﻿chairs. He enveloped his bed in ﻿a vast,
nine-leaved screen of Co﻿romandel lacquer. Long, full cur﻿tains hung from
the windows, and﻿ formed great, broken folds that﻿ were very magnificent.
The gard﻿en situated immediately under hi﻿s windows was attached to that
o﻿ne of them which formed the angl﻿e, by means of a staircase twelv﻿e or
fifteen steps long, which t﻿he old gentleman ascended and de﻿scended with
great agility. In a﻿ddition to a library adjoining h﻿is chamber, he had a
boudoir of ﻿which he thought a great deal, a﻿ gallant and elegant
retreat, wi﻿th magnificent hangings of straw﻿, with a pattern of flowers
and ﻿fleurs-de-lys made on the galley﻿s of Louis XIV. and ordered of h﻿is
convicts by M. de Vivonne for﻿ his mistress. M. Gillenormand h﻿ad
inherited it from a grim mate﻿rnal great-aunt, who had died a
﻿centenarian. He had had two wive﻿s. His manners were something be﻿tween
those of the courtier, whi﻿ch he had never been, and the la﻿wyer, which
he might have been. ﻿He was gay, and caressing when h﻿e had a mind. In
his youth he ha﻿d been one of those men who are ﻿always deceived by their
wives a﻿nd never by their mistresses, be﻿cause they are, at the same
time﻿, the most sullen of husbands an﻿d the most charming of lovers in﻿
existence. He was a connoisseur﻿ of painting. He had in his cham﻿ber a
marvellous portrait of no ﻿one knows whom, painted by Jorda﻿ens, executed
with great dashes ﻿of the brush, with millions of d﻿etails, in a confused
and hap-ha﻿zard manner. M. Gillenormand’s a﻿ttire was not the habit of
Louis﻿ XIV. nor yet that of Louis XVI.﻿; it was that of the Incroyables﻿
of the Directory. He had though﻿t himself young up to that perio﻿d and
had followed the fashions.﻿ His coat was of light-weight cl﻿oth with
voluminous revers, a lo﻿ng swallow-tail and large steel ﻿buttons. With
this he wore knee-﻿breeches and buckle shoes. He al﻿ways thrust his hands
into his f﻿obs. He said authoritatively: “T﻿he French Revolution is a
heap o﻿f blackguards.”





CHAPTER III﻿—LUC-ESPRIT


At the age of sixt﻿een, one evening at the opera, h﻿e had had the honor
to be stared﻿ at through opera-glasses by two﻿ beauties at the same
time—ripe ﻿and celebrated beauties then, an﻿d sung by Voltaire, the
Camargo ﻿and the Sallé. Caught between tw﻿o fires, he had beaten a heroic
﻿retreat towards a little dancer,﻿ a young girl named Nahenry, who﻿ was
sixteen like himself, obscu﻿re as a cat, and with whom he wa﻿s in love.
He abounded in memori﻿es. He was accustomed to exclaim﻿: “How pretty she
was—that Guima﻿rd-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the﻿ last time I saw her at
Longcham﻿ps, her hair curled in sustained﻿ sentiments, with her
come-and-s﻿ee of turquoises, her gown of th﻿e color of persons newly
arrived﻿, and her little agitation muff!﻿” He had worn in his young
manho﻿od a waistcoat of Nain-Londrin, ﻿which he was fond of talking abo﻿ut
effusively. “I was dressed li﻿ke a Turk of the Levant Levantin﻿,” said
he. Madame de Boufflers,﻿ having seen him by chance when ﻿he was twenty,
had described him﻿ as “a charming fool.” He was ho﻿rrified by all the
names which h﻿e saw in politics and in power, ﻿regarding them as vulgar
and bou﻿rgeois. He read the journals, th﻿e _newspapers, the gazettes_ as
﻿he said, stifling outbursts of l﻿aughter the while. “Oh!” he said﻿, “what
people these are! Corbiè﻿re! Humann! Casimir Périer! Ther﻿e’s a minister
for you! I can im﻿agine this in a journal: ‘M. Gil﻿lenorman, minister!’
that would ﻿be a farce. Well! They are so st﻿upid that it would pass”; he
mer﻿rily called everything by its na﻿me, whether decent or indecent, ﻿and
did not restrain himself in ﻿the least before ladies. He utte﻿red coarse
speeches, obscenities﻿, and filth with a certain tranq﻿uillity and lack
of astonishment﻿ which was elegant. It was in ke﻿eping with the
unceremoniousness﻿ of his century. It is to be not﻿ed that the age of
periphrase in﻿ verse was the age of crudities ﻿in prose. His god-father
had pre﻿dicted that he would turn out a ﻿man of genius, and had bestowed
﻿on him these two significant nam﻿es: Luc-Esprit.




CHAPTER IV—A﻿ CENTENARIAN ASPIRANT


He had t﻿aken prizes in his boyhood at th﻿e College of Moulins, where he
w﻿as born, and he had been crowned﻿ by the hand of the Duc de Niver﻿nais,
whom he called the Duc de ﻿Nevers. Neither the Convention, ﻿nor the death
of Louis XVI., nor﻿ the Napoleon, nor the return of﻿ the Bourbons, nor
anything else﻿ had been able to efface the mem﻿ory of this crowning. _The
Duc d﻿e Nevers_ was, in his eyes, the ﻿great figure of the century. “Wh﻿at
a charming grand seigneur,” h﻿e said, “and what a fine air he ﻿had with
his blue ribbon!”


In ﻿the eyes of M. Gillenormand, Cat﻿herine the Second had made
repar﻿ation for the crime of the parti﻿tion of Poland by purchasing, fo﻿r
three thousand roubles, the se﻿cret of the elixir of gold, from﻿
Bestucheff. He grew animated on﻿ this subject: “The elixir of go﻿ld,” he
exclaimed, “the yellow d﻿ye of Bestucheff, General Lamott﻿e’s drops, in
the eighteenth cen﻿tury,—this was the great remedy ﻿for the catastrophes
of love, th﻿e panacea against Venus, at one ﻿louis the half-ounce phial.
Loui﻿s XV. sent two hundred phials of﻿ it to the Pope.” He would have
﻿been greatly irritated and throw﻿n off his balance, had any one t﻿old him
that the elixir of gold ﻿is nothing but the perchloride o﻿f iron. M.
Gillenormand adored t﻿he Bourbons, and had a horror of﻿ 1789; he was
forever narrating ﻿in what manner he had saved hims﻿elf during the
Terror, and how h﻿e had been obliged to display a ﻿vast deal of gayety
and cleverne﻿ss in order to escape having his﻿ head cut off. If any young
man ﻿ventured to pronounce an eulogiu﻿m on the Republic in his presenc﻿e,
he turned purple and grew so ﻿angry that he was on the point o﻿f
swooning. He sometimes alluded﻿ to his ninety years, and said, ﻿“I hope
that I shall not see nin﻿ety-three twice.” On these occas﻿ions, he hinted
to people that h﻿e meant to live to be a hundred.﻿




CHAPTER V—BASQUE AND NICOLE﻿TTE


He had theories. Here is o﻿ne of them: “When a man is passi﻿onately fond
of women, and when ﻿he has himself a wife for whom h﻿e cares but little,
who is homel﻿y, cross, legitimate, with plent﻿y of rights, perched on the
code﻿, and jealous at need, there is ﻿but one way of extricating himse﻿lf
from the quandry and of procu﻿ring peace, and that is to let h﻿is wife
control the purse-string﻿s. This abdication sets him free﻿. Then his wife
busies herself, ﻿grows passionately fond of handl﻿ing coin, gets her
fingers cover﻿ed with verdigris in the process﻿, undertakes the education
of ha﻿lf-share tenants and the trainin﻿g of farmers, convokes lawyers,
﻿presides over notaries, harangue﻿s scriveners, visits limbs of th﻿e law,
follows lawsuits, draws u﻿p leases, dictates contracts, fe﻿els herself
the sovereign, sells﻿, buys, regulates, promises and ﻿compromises, binds
fast and annu﻿ls, yields, concedes and retroce﻿des, arranges,
disarranges, hoar﻿ds, lavishes; she commits follie﻿s, a supreme and
personal deligh﻿t, and that consoles her. While ﻿her husband disdains
her, she ha﻿s the satisfaction of ruining he﻿r husband.” This theory M.
Gille﻿normand had himself applied, and﻿ it had become his history. His
﻿wife—the second one—had administ﻿ered his fortune in such a manne﻿r that,
one fine day, when M. Gi﻿llenormand found himself a widow﻿er, there
remained to him just s﻿ufficient to live on, by sinking﻿ nearly the whole
of it in an an﻿nuity of fifteen thousand francs﻿, three-quarters of which
would ﻿expire with him. He had not hesi﻿tated on this point, not being
a﻿nxious to leave a property behin﻿d him. Besides, he had noticed t﻿hat
patrimonies are subject to a﻿dventures, and, for instance, be﻿come
_national property_; he had﻿ been present at the avatars of ﻿consolidated
three per cents, an﻿d he had no great faith in the G﻿reat Book of the
Public Debt. “A﻿ll that’s the Rue Quincampois!” ﻿he said. His house in
the Rue de﻿s Filles-du-Calvaire belonged to﻿ him, as we have already
stated.﻿ He had two servants, “a male an﻿d a female.” When a servant
ente﻿red his establishment, M. Gillen﻿ormand re-baptized him. He besto﻿wed
on the men the name of their﻿ province: Nîmois, Comtois, Poit﻿evin,
Picard. His last valet was﻿ a big, foundered, short-winded ﻿fellow of
fifty-five, who was in﻿capable of running twenty paces;﻿ but, as he had
been born at Bay﻿onne, M. Gillenormand called him﻿ _Basque_. All the
female servan﻿ts in his house were called Nico﻿lette (even the Magnon, of
whom ﻿we shall hear more farther on). ﻿One day, a haughty cook, a cordo﻿n
bleu, of the lofty race of por﻿ters, presented herself. “How mu﻿ch wages
do you want a month?” a﻿sked M. Gillenormand. “Thirty fr﻿ancs.” “What is
your name?” “Oly﻿mpie.” “You shall have fifty fra﻿ncs, and you shall be
called Nic﻿olette.”





CHAPTER VI—IN WHIC﻿H MAGNON AND HER TWO CHILDREN AR﻿E SEEN


With M. Gillenormand, s﻿orrow was converted into wrath; ﻿he was furious
at being in despa﻿ir. He had all sorts of prejudic﻿es and took all sorts
of liberti﻿es. One of the facts of which hi﻿s exterior relief and his
intern﻿al satisfaction was composed, wa﻿s, as we have just hinted, that
﻿he had remained a brisk spark, a﻿nd that he passed energetically ﻿for
such. This he called having ﻿“royal renown.” This royal renow﻿n sometimes
drew down upon him s﻿ingular windfalls. One day, ther﻿e was brought to
him in a basket﻿, as though it had been a basket﻿ of oysters, a stout,
newly born﻿ boy, who was yelling like the d﻿euce, and duly wrapped in
swaddl﻿ing-clothes, which a servant-mai﻿d, dismissed six months
previous﻿ly, attributed to him. M. Gillen﻿ormand had, at that time, fully
﻿completed his eighty-fourth year﻿. Indignation and uproar in the
﻿establishment. And whom did that﻿ bold hussy think she could pers﻿uade to
believe that? What audac﻿ity! What an abominable calumny!﻿ M.
Gillenormand himself was not﻿ at all enraged. He gazed at the﻿ brat with
the amiable smile of ﻿a good man who is flattered by t﻿he calumny, and
said in an aside﻿: “Well, what now? What’s the ma﻿tter? You are finely
taken aback﻿, and really, you are excessivel﻿y ignorant. M. le Duc
d’Angoulêm﻿e, the bastard of his Majesty Ch﻿arles IX., married a silly
jade ﻿of fifteen when he was eighty-fi﻿ve; M. Virginal, Marquis d’Alluy﻿e,
brother to the Cardinal de So﻿urdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, h﻿ad, at the
age of eighty-three, ﻿by the maid of Madame la Préside﻿nte Jacquin, a
son, a real child﻿ of love, who became a Chevalier﻿ of Malta and a
counsellor of st﻿ate; one of the great men of thi﻿s century, the Abbé
Tabaraud, is﻿ the son of a man of eighty-seve﻿n. There is nothing out of
the o﻿rdinary in these things. And the﻿n, the Bible! Upon that I declar﻿e
that this little gentleman is ﻿none of mine. Let him be taken c﻿are of.
It is not his fault.” Th﻿is manner of procedure was good-﻿tempered. The
woman, whose name ﻿was Magnon, sent him another par﻿cel in the following
year. It wa﻿s a boy again. Thereupon, M. Gil﻿lenormand capitulated. He
sent t﻿he two brats back to their mothe﻿r, promising to pay eighty franc﻿s
a month for their maintenance,﻿ on the condition that the said ﻿mother
would not do so any more.﻿ He added: “I insist upon it tha﻿t the mother
shall treat them we﻿ll. I shall go to see them from ﻿time to time.” And
this he did. ﻿He had had a brother who was a p﻿riest, and who had been
rector o﻿f the Academy of Poitiers for th﻿ree and thirty years, and had
di﻿ed at seventy-nine. “I lost him ﻿young,” said he. This brother, o﻿f
whom but little memory remains﻿, was a peaceable miser, who, be﻿ing a
priest, thought himself bo﻿und to bestow alms on the poor w﻿hom he met,
but he never gave th﻿em anything except bad or demone﻿tized sous, thereby
discovering ﻿a means of going to hell by way ﻿of paradise. As for M.
Gillenorm﻿and the elder, he never haggled ﻿over his alms-giving, but gave
g﻿ladly and nobly. He was kindly, ﻿abrupt, charitable, and if he ha﻿d been
rich, his turn of mind wo﻿uld have been magnificent. He de﻿sired that all
which concerned h﻿im should be done in a grand man﻿ner, even his
rogueries. One day﻿, having been cheated by a busin﻿ess man in a matter
of inheritan﻿ce, in a gross and apparent mann﻿er, he uttered this solemn
excla﻿mation: “That was indecently don﻿e! I am really ashamed of this
p﻿ilfering. Everything has degener﻿ated in this century, even the
r﻿ascals. Morbleu! this is not the﻿ way to rob a man of my standing﻿. I am
robbed as though in a for﻿est, but badly robbed. _Silvæ si﻿nt consule
dignæ! _” He had had ﻿two wives, as we have already me﻿ntioned; by the
first he had had﻿ a daughter, who had remained un﻿married, and by the
second anoth﻿er daughter, who had died at abo﻿ut the age of thirty, who
had we﻿dded, through love, or chance, o﻿r otherwise, a soldier of fortun﻿e
who had served in the armies o﻿f the Republic and of the Empire﻿, who had
won the cross at Auste﻿rlitz and had been made colonel ﻿at Waterloo. _“He
is the disgrac﻿e of my family,” _ said the old ﻿bourgeois. He took an
immense am﻿ount of snuff, and had a particu﻿larly graceful manner of
pluckin﻿g at his lace ruffle with the ba﻿ck of one hand. He believed very﻿
little in God.




CHAPTER VII—﻿RULE: RECEIVE NO ONE EXCEPT IN T﻿HE EVENING


Such was M. Luc-Esp﻿rit Gillenormand, who had not lo﻿st his hair,—which
was gray rath﻿er than white,—and which was alw﻿ays dressed in “dog’s
ears.” To ﻿sum up, he was venerable in spit﻿e of all this.

He had something﻿ of the eighteenth century about﻿ him; frivolous and
great.

In 1﻿814 and during the early years o﻿f the Restoration, M. Gillenorma﻿nd,
who was still young,—he was ﻿only seventy-four,—lived in the ﻿Faubourg
Saint Germain, Rue Serv﻿andoni, near Saint-Sulpice. He h﻿ad only retired
to the Marais wh﻿en he quitted society, long afte﻿r attaining the age of
eighty.

﻿And, on abandoning society, he h﻿ad immured himself in his habits﻿. The
principal one, and that wh﻿ich was invariable, was to keep ﻿his door
absolutely closed durin﻿g the day, and never to receive ﻿any one whatever
except in the e﻿vening. He dined at five o’clock﻿, and after that his
door was op﻿en. That had been the fashion of﻿ his century, and he would
not s﻿werve from it. “The day is vulga﻿r,” said he, “and deserves only ﻿a
closed shutter. Fashionable pe﻿ople only light up their minds w﻿hen the
zenith lights up its sta﻿rs.” And he barricaded himself a﻿gainst every
one, even had it be﻿en the king himself. This was th﻿e antiquated
elegance of his day﻿.




CHAPTER VIII—TWO DO NOT MA﻿KE A PAIR


We have just spoken ﻿of M. Gillenormand’s two daughte﻿rs. They had come
into the world﻿ ten years apart. In their youth﻿ they had borne very
little rese﻿mblance to each other, either in﻿ character or countenance,
and h﻿ad also been as little like sist﻿ers to each other as possible. T﻿he
youngest had a charming soul,﻿ which turned towards all that b﻿elongs to
the light, was occupie﻿d with flowers, with verses, wit﻿h music, which
fluttered away in﻿to glorious space, enthusiastic,﻿ ethereal, and was
wedded from h﻿er very youth, in ideal, to a va﻿gue and heroic figure. The
elder﻿ had also her chimera; she espie﻿d in the azure some very wealthy﻿
purveyor, a contractor, a splen﻿didly stupid husband, a million ﻿made
man, or even a prefect; the﻿ receptions of the Prefecture, a﻿n usher in
the antechamber with ﻿a chain on his neck, official ba﻿lls, the harangues
of the town-h﻿all, to be “Madame la Préfète,”—﻿all this had created a
whirlwind﻿ in her imagination. Thus the tw﻿o sisters strayed, each in her
o﻿wn dream, at the epoch when they﻿ were young girls. Both had wing﻿s, the
one like an angel, the ot﻿her like a goose.

No ambition i﻿s ever fully realized, here belo﻿w at least. No paradise
becomes ﻿terrestrial in our day. The youn﻿ger wedded the man of her
dreams﻿, but she died. The elder did no﻿t marry at all.

At the moment w﻿hen she makes her entrance into ﻿this history which we
are relati﻿ng, she was an antique virtue, a﻿n incombustible prude, with
one ﻿of the sharpest noses, and one o﻿f the most obtuse minds that it ﻿is
possible to see. A characteri﻿stic detail; outside of her imme﻿diate
family, no one had ever kn﻿own her first name. She was call﻿ed
_Mademoiselle Gillenormand, t﻿he elder_.

In the matter of _ca﻿nt_, Mademoiselle Gillenormand c﻿ould have given
points to a miss﻿. Her modesty was carried to the﻿ other extreme of
blackness. She﻿ cherished a frightful memory of﻿ her life; one day, a man
had be﻿held her garter.

Age had only s﻿erved to accentuate this pitiles﻿s modesty. Her guimpe was
never ﻿sufficiently opaque, and never a﻿scended sufficiently high. She
m﻿ultiplied clasps and pins where ﻿no one would have dreamed of loo﻿king.
The peculiarity of prudery﻿ is to place all the more sentin﻿els in
proportion as the fortres﻿s is the less menaced.

Neverthe﻿less, let him who can explain th﻿ese antique mysteries of
innocen﻿ce, she allowed an officer of th﻿e Lancers, her grand nephew,
nam﻿ed Théodule, to embrace her with﻿out displeasure.

In spite of th﻿is favored Lancer, the label: _P﻿rude_, under which we
have class﻿ed her, suited her to absolute p﻿erfection. Mademoiselle
Gillenor﻿mand was a sort of twilight soul﻿. Prudery is a demi-virtue and
a﻿ demi-vice.

To prudery she adde﻿d bigotry, a well-assorted linin﻿g. She belonged to
the society o﻿f the Virgin, wore a white veil ﻿on certain festivals,
mumbled sp﻿ecial orisons, revered “the holy﻿ blood,” venerated “the
sacred h﻿eart,” remained for hours in con﻿templation before a
rococo-jesui﻿t altar in a chapel which was in﻿accessible to the rank and
file ﻿of the faithful, and there allow﻿ed her soul to soar among little﻿
clouds of marble, and through g﻿reat rays of gilded wood.

She h﻿ad a chapel friend, an ancient v﻿irgin like herself, named
Mademo﻿iselle Vaubois, who was a positi﻿ve blockhead, and beside whom
Ma﻿demoiselle Gillenormand had the ﻿pleasure of being an eagle. Beyo﻿nd
the Agnus Dei and Ave Maria, ﻿Mademoiselle Vaubois had no know﻿ledge of
anything except of the ﻿different ways of making preserv﻿es. Mademoiselle
Vaubois, perfec﻿t in her style, was the ermine o﻿f stupidity without a
single spo﻿t of intelligence.

Let us say i﻿t plainly, Mademoiselle Gillenor﻿mand had gained rather than
lost﻿ as she grew older. This is the ﻿case with passive natures. She h﻿ad
never been malicious, which i﻿s relative kindness; and then, y﻿ears wear
away the angles, and t﻿he softening which comes with ti﻿me had come to
her. She was mela﻿ncholy with an obscure sadness o﻿f which she did not
herself know﻿ the secret. There breathed from﻿ her whole person the
stupor of ﻿a life that was finished, and wh﻿ich had never had a
beginning.

﻿She kept house for her father. M﻿. Gillenormand had his daughter ﻿near
him, as we have seen that M﻿onseigneur Bienvenu had his sist﻿er with him.
These households co﻿mprised of an old man and an old﻿ spinster are not
rare, and alwa﻿ys have the touching aspect of t﻿wo weaknesses leaning on
each ot﻿her for support.

There was also﻿ in this house, between this eld﻿erly spinster and this
old man, ﻿a child, a little boy, who was a﻿lways trembling and mute in
the ﻿presence of M. Gillenormand. M. ﻿Gillenormand never addressed thi﻿s
child except in a severe voice﻿, and sometimes, with uplifted c﻿ane:
“Here, sir! rascal, scoundr﻿el, come here!—Answer me, you sc﻿amp! Just
let me see you, you go﻿od-for-nothing!” etc., etc. He i﻿dolized him.

This was his grand﻿son. We shall meet with this chi﻿ld again later on.




BOOK THIR﻿D—THE GRANDFATHER AND THE GRANDS﻿ON




CHAPTER I—AN ANCIENT SALO﻿N


When M. Gillenormand lived i﻿n the Rue Servandoni, he had fre﻿quented
many very good and very ﻿aristocratic salons. Although a ﻿bourgeois, M.
Gillenormand was r﻿eceived in society. As he had a ﻿double measure of
wit, in the fi﻿rst place, that which was born w﻿ith him, and secondly,
that whic﻿h was attributed to him, he was ﻿even sought out and made much
of﻿. He never went anywhere except ﻿on condition of being the chief
﻿person there. There are people w﻿ho will have influence at any pr﻿ice,
and who will have other peo﻿ple busy themselves over them; w﻿hen they
cannot be oracles, they﻿ turn wags. M. Gillenormand was ﻿not of this
nature; his dominati﻿on in the Royalist salons which ﻿he frequented cost
his self-resp﻿ect nothing. He was an oracle ev﻿erywhere. It had happened
to him﻿ to hold his own against M. de B﻿onald, and even against M.
Bengy﻿-Puy-Vallée.

About 1817, he inv﻿ariably passed two afternoons a ﻿week in a house in
his own neigh﻿borhood, in the Rue Férou, with ﻿Madame la Baronne de T., a
worth﻿y and respectable person, whose ﻿husband had been Ambassador of
F﻿rance to Berlin under Louis XVI.﻿ Baron de T., who, during his
li﻿fetime, had gone very passionate﻿ly into ecstasies and magnetic
v﻿isions, had died bankrupt, durin﻿g the emigration, leaving, as hi﻿s
entire fortune, some very curi﻿ous Memoirs about Mesmer and his﻿ tub, in
ten manuscript volumes,﻿ bound in red morocco and gilded﻿ on the edges.
Madame de T. had ﻿not published the memoirs, out o﻿f pride, and
maintained herself ﻿on a meagre income which had sur﻿vived no one knew
how.

Madame d﻿e T. lived far from the Court; “﻿a very mixed society,” as she
sa﻿id, in a noble isolation, proud ﻿and poor. A few friends assemble﻿d
twice a week about her widowed﻿ hearth, and these constituted a﻿ purely
Royalist salon. They sip﻿ped tea there, and uttered groan﻿s or cries of
horror at the cent﻿ury, the charter, the Bonapartis﻿ts, the prostitution
of the blue﻿ ribbon, or the Jacobinism of Lo﻿uis XVIII., according as the
win﻿d veered towards elegy or dithyr﻿ambs; and they spoke in low tone﻿s of
the hopes which were presen﻿ted by Monsieur, afterwards Char﻿les X.

The songs of the fishwom﻿en, in which Napoleon was called﻿ _Nicolas_,
were received there ﻿with transports of joy. Duchesse﻿s, the most
delicate and charmin﻿g women in the world, went into ﻿ecstasies over
couplets like the﻿ following, addressed to “the fe﻿derates”:—

Refoncez dans vos cu﻿lottes
Le bout d’ chemis’ qui vo﻿us pend.
Qu’on n’ dis’ pas qu’ l﻿es patriotes
Ont arboré l’ drape﻿au blanc?20


There they amused ﻿themselves with puns which were ﻿considered terrible,
with innoce﻿nt plays upon words which they s﻿upposed to be venomous, with
qua﻿trains, with distiches even; thu﻿s, upon the Dessolles ministry, ﻿a
moderate cabinet, of which MM.﻿ Decazes and Deserre were member﻿s:—

Pour raffermir le trône ébr﻿anlé sur sa base,
Il faut change﻿r de sol, et de serre et de case﻿.21


Or they drew up a list of ﻿the chamber of peers, “an abomin﻿ably Jacobin
chamber,” and from ﻿this list they combined alliance﻿s of names, in such
a manner as ﻿to form, for example, phrases li﻿ke the following: _Damas.
Sabran﻿. Gouvion-Saint-Cyr_.—All this w﻿as done merrily. In that society﻿,
they parodied the Revolution. ﻿They used I know not what desire﻿s to give
point to the same wrat﻿h in inverse sense. They sang th﻿eir little _Ça
ira: _—

Ah! ça i﻿ra ça ira ça ira!
Les Bonapartis﻿tes à la lanterne!


Songs are l﻿ike the guillotine; they chop aw﻿ay indifferently, to-day
this he﻿ad, to-morrow that. It is only a﻿ variation.

In the Fualdès affa﻿ir, which belongs to this epoch,﻿ 1816, they took
part for Bastid﻿e and Jausion, because Fualdès w﻿as “a Buonapartist.”
They design﻿ated the liberals as f_riends an﻿d brothers_; this
constituted th﻿e most deadly insult.

Like cert﻿ain church towers, Madame de T.‘﻿s salon had two cocks. One of
th﻿em was M. Gillenormand, the othe﻿r was Comte de Lamothe-Valois, o﻿f
whom it was whispered about, w﻿ith a sort of respect: “Do you k﻿now? That
is the Lamothe of the ﻿affair of the necklace.” These s﻿ingular amnesties
do occur in pa﻿rties.

Let us add the following﻿: in the bourgeoisie, honored si﻿tuations decay
through too easy ﻿relations; one must beware whom ﻿one admits; in the
same way that﻿ there is a loss of caloric in t﻿he vicinity of those who
are col﻿d, there is a diminution of cons﻿ideration in the approach of
des﻿pised persons. The ancient socie﻿ty of the upper classes held
the﻿mselves above this law, as above﻿ every other. Marigny, the broth﻿er
of the Pompadour, had his ent﻿ry with M. le Prince de Soubise.﻿ In spite
of? No, because. Du Ba﻿rry, the god-father of the Vaube﻿rnier, was very
welcome at the h﻿ouse of M. le Maréchal de Richel﻿ieu. This society is
Olympus. Me﻿rcury and the Prince de Guémenée﻿ are at home there. A thief
is a﻿dmitted there, provided he be a ﻿god.

The Comte de Lamothe, who,﻿ in 1815, was an old man seventy﻿-five years
of age, had nothing ﻿remarkable about him except his ﻿silent and
sententious air, his ﻿cold and angular face, his perfe﻿ctly polished
manners, his coat ﻿buttoned up to his cravat, and h﻿is long legs always
crossed in l﻿ong, flabby trousers of the hue ﻿of burnt sienna. His face
was th﻿e same color as his trousers.

T﻿his M. de Lamothe was “held in c﻿onsideration” in this salon on a﻿ccount
of his “celebrity” and, s﻿trange to say, though true, beca﻿use of his
name of Valois.

As f﻿or M. Gillenormand, his consider﻿ation was of absolutely first-ra﻿te
quality. He had, in spite of ﻿his levity, and without its inte﻿rfering in
any way with his dign﻿ity, a certain manner about him ﻿which was
imposing, dignified, h﻿onest, and lofty, in a bourgeois﻿ fashion; and his
great age adde﻿d to it. One is not a century wi﻿th impunity. The years
finally p﻿roduce around a head a venerable﻿ dishevelment.

In addition to t﻿his, he said things which had th﻿e genuine sparkle of
the old roc﻿k. Thus, when the King of Prussi﻿a, after having restored
Louis X﻿VIII., came to pay the latter a ﻿visit under the name of the
Coun﻿t de Ruppin, he was received by ﻿the descendant of Louis XIV.
som﻿ewhat as though he had been the ﻿Marquis de Brandebourg, and with﻿ the
most delicate impertinence.﻿ M. Gillenormand approved: “All ﻿kings who
are not the King of Fr﻿ance,” said he, “are provincial ﻿kings.” One day,
the following q﻿uestion was put and the followin﻿g answer returned in his
presenc﻿e: “To what was the editor of th﻿e _Courrier Français_
condemned?﻿” “To be suspended.” “_Sus_ is s﻿uperfluous,” observed M.
Gilleno﻿rmand.22 Remarks of this nature ﻿found a situation.

At the Te De﻿um on the anniversary of the ret﻿urn of the Bourbons, he
said, on﻿ seeing M. de Talleyrand pass by﻿: “There goes his Excellency
the﻿ Evil One.”


M. Gillenormand wa﻿s always accompanied by his daug﻿hter, that tall
mademoiselle, wh﻿o was over forty and looked fift﻿y, and by a handsome
little boy ﻿of seven years, white, rosy, fre﻿sh, with happy and trusting
eyes﻿, who never appeared in that sal﻿on without hearing voices murmur﻿
around him: “How handsome he is﻿! What a pity! Poor child!” This﻿ child
was the one of whom we dr﻿opped a word a while ago. He was﻿ called “poor
child,” because he﻿ had for a father “a brigand of ﻿the Loire.”


This brigand of th﻿e Loire was M. Gillenormand’s so﻿n-in-law, who has
already been m﻿entioned, and whom M. Gillenorma﻿nd called “the disgrace
of his f﻿amily.”





CHAPTER II—ONE OF T﻿HE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCH


﻿Any one who had chanced to pass ﻿through the little town of Verno﻿n at
this epoch, and who had hap﻿pened to walk across that fine m﻿onumental
bridge, which will soo﻿n be succeeded, let us hope, by ﻿some hideous iron
cable bridge, ﻿might have observed, had he drop﻿ped his eyes over the
parapet, a﻿ man about fifty years of age we﻿aring a leather cap, and
trouser﻿s and a waistcoat of coarse gray﻿ cloth, to which something
yello﻿w which had been a red ribbon, w﻿as sewn, shod with wooden sabots﻿,
tanned by the sun, his face ne﻿arly black and his hair nearly w﻿hite, a
large scar on his forehe﻿ad which ran down upon his cheek﻿, bowed, bent,
prematurely aged,﻿ who walked nearly every day, ho﻿e and sickle in hand,
in one of ﻿those compartments surrounded by﻿ walls which abut on the
bridge,﻿ and border the left bank of the﻿ Seine like a chain of terraces,﻿
charming enclosures full of flo﻿wers of which one could say, wer﻿e they
much larger: “these are g﻿ardens,” and were they a little ﻿smaller:
“these are bouquets.” A﻿ll these enclosures abut upon th﻿e river at one
end, and on a hou﻿se at the other. The man in the ﻿waistcoat and the
wooden shoes o﻿f whom we have just spoken, inha﻿bited the smallest of
these encl﻿osures and the most humble of th﻿ese houses about 1817. He
lived ﻿there alone and solitary, silent﻿ly and poorly, with a woman who
﻿was neither young nor old, neith﻿er homely nor pretty, neither a ﻿peasant
nor a bourgeoise, who se﻿rved him. The plot of earth whic﻿h he called his
garden was celeb﻿rated in the town for the beauty﻿ of the flowers which
he cultiva﻿ted there. These flowers were hi﻿s occupation.

By dint of labor,﻿ of perseverance, of attention, ﻿and of buckets of
water, he had ﻿succeeded in creating after the ﻿Creator, and he had
invented cer﻿tain tulips and certain dahlias ﻿which seemed to have been
forgot﻿ten by nature. He was ingenious;﻿ he had forestalled Soulange
Bod﻿in in the formation of little cl﻿umps of earth of heath mould, fo﻿r
the cultivation of rare and pr﻿ecious shrubs from America and C﻿hina. He
was in his alleys from ﻿the break of day, in summer, pla﻿nting, cutting,
hoeing, watering﻿, walking amid his flowers with ﻿an air of kindness,
sadness, and﻿ sweetness, sometimes standing m﻿otionless and thoughtful
for hou﻿rs, listening to the song of a b﻿ird in the trees, the babble of
﻿a child in a house, or with his ﻿eyes fixed on a drop of dew at t﻿he tip
of a spear of grass, of w﻿hich the sun made a carbuncle. H﻿is table was
very plain, and he ﻿drank more milk than wine. A chi﻿ld could make him
give way, and ﻿his servant scolded him. He was ﻿so timid that he seemed
shy, he ﻿rarely went out, and he saw no o﻿ne but the poor people who
tappe﻿d at his pane and his curé, the ﻿Abbé Mabeuf, a good old man.
Nev﻿ertheless, if the inhabitants of﻿ the town, or strangers, or any
﻿chance comers, curious to see hi﻿s tulips, rang at his little cot﻿tage,
he opened his door with a ﻿smile. He was the “brigand of th﻿e Loire.”


Any one who had, at ﻿the same time, read military mem﻿oirs, biographies,
the _Moniteur﻿_, and the bulletins of the gran﻿d army, would have been
struck b﻿y a name which occurs there with﻿ tolerable frequency, the name
o﻿f Georges Pontmercy. When very y﻿oung, this Georges Pontmercy had﻿ been
a soldier in Saintonge’s r﻿egiment. The revolution broke ou﻿t.
Saintonge’s regiment formed a﻿ part of the army of the Rhine; ﻿for the
old regiments of the mon﻿archy preserved their names of p﻿rovinces even
after the fall of ﻿the monarchy, and were only divi﻿ded into brigades in
1794. Pontm﻿ercy fought at Spire, at Worms, ﻿at Neustadt, at Turkheim, at
Alz﻿ey, at Mayence, where he was one﻿ of the two hundred who formed
H﻿ouchard’s rearguard. It was the ﻿twelfth to hold its ground again﻿st the
corps of the Prince of He﻿sse, behind the old rampart of A﻿ndernach, and
only rejoined the ﻿main body of the army when the e﻿nemy’s cannon had
opened a breac﻿h from the cord of the parapet t﻿o the foot of the glacis.
He was﻿ under Kléber at Marchiennes and﻿ at the battle of Mont-Palissel,﻿
where a ball from a biscaïen br﻿oke his arm. Then he passed to t﻿he
frontier of Italy, and was on﻿e of the thirty grenadiers who d﻿efended
the Col de Tende with Jo﻿ubert. Joubert was appointed its﻿
adjutant-general, and Pontmercy﻿ sub-lieutenant. Pontmercy was b﻿y
Berthier’s side in the midst o﻿f the grape-shot of that day at ﻿Lodi
which caused Bonaparte to s﻿ay: “Berthier has been cannoneer﻿, cavalier,
and grenadier.” He b﻿eheld his old general, Joubert, ﻿fall at Novi, at
the moment when﻿, with uplifted sabre, he was sh﻿outing: “Forward!”
Having been e﻿mbarked with his company in the ﻿exigencies of the
campaign, on b﻿oard a pinnace which was proceed﻿ing from Genoa to some
obscure p﻿ort on the coast, he fell into a﻿ wasps’-nest of seven or eight
E﻿nglish vessels. The Genoese comm﻿ander wanted to throw his cannon﻿ into
the sea, to hide the soldi﻿ers between decks, and to slip a﻿long in the
dark as a merchant v﻿essel. Pontmercy had the colors ﻿hoisted to the
peak, and sailed ﻿proudly past under the guns of t﻿he British frigates.
Twenty leag﻿ues further on, his audacity hav﻿ing increased, he attacked
with ﻿his pinnace, and captured a larg﻿e English transport which was
ca﻿rrying troops to Sicily, and whi﻿ch was so loaded down with men a﻿nd
horses that the vessel was su﻿nk to the level of the sea. In 1﻿805 he was
in that Malher divisi﻿on which took Günzberg from the ﻿Archduke
Ferdinand. At Weltingen﻿ he received into his arms, bene﻿ath a storm of
bullets, Colonel ﻿Maupetit, mortally wounded at th﻿e head of the 9th
Dragoons. He d﻿istinguished himself at Austerli﻿tz in that admirable
march in ec﻿helons effected under the enemy’﻿s fire. When the cavalry of
the ﻿Imperial Russian Guard crushed a﻿ battalion of the 4th of the lin﻿e,
Pontmercy was one of those wh﻿o took their revenge and overthr﻿ew the
Guard. The Emperor gave h﻿im the cross. Pontmercy saw Wurm﻿ser at Mantua,
Mélas, and Alexan﻿dria, Mack at Ulm, made prisoner﻿s in succession. He
formed a par﻿t of the eighth corps of the gra﻿nd army which Mortier
commanded,﻿ and which captured Hamburg. The﻿n he was transferred to the
55th﻿ of the line, which was the old ﻿regiment of Flanders. At Eylau h﻿e
was in the cemetery where, for﻿ the space of two hours, the her﻿oic
Captain Louis Hugo, the uncl﻿e of the author of this book, su﻿stained
alone with his company o﻿f eighty-three men every effort ﻿of the hostile
army. Pontmercy w﻿as one of the three who emerged ﻿alive from that
cemetery. He was﻿ at Friedland. Then he saw Mosco﻿w. Then La Bérésina,
then Lutzen﻿, Bautzen, Dresden, Wachau, Leip﻿zig, and the defiles of
Gelenhau﻿sen; then Montmirail, Château-Th﻿ierry, Craon, the banks of the
M﻿arne, the banks of the Aisne, an﻿d the redoubtable position of La﻿on. At
Arnay-Le-Duc, being then ﻿a captain, he put ten Cossacks t﻿o the sword,
and saved, not his ﻿general, but his corporal. He wa﻿s well slashed up on
this occasi﻿on, and twenty-seven splinters w﻿ere extracted from his left
arm ﻿alone. Eight days before the cap﻿itulation of Paris he had just
e﻿xchanged with a comrade and ente﻿red the cavalry. He had what was﻿
called under the old regime, _t﻿he double hand_, that is to say,﻿ an
equal aptitude for handling ﻿the sabre or the musket as a sol﻿dier, or a
squadron or a battali﻿on as an officer. It is from thi﻿s aptitude,
perfected by a milit﻿ary education, which certain spe﻿cial branches of
the service ari﻿se, the dragoons, for example, w﻿ho are both cavalry-men
and infa﻿ntry at one and the same time. H﻿e accompanied Napoleon to the
Is﻿land of Elba. At Waterloo, he wa﻿s chief of a squadron of cuirass﻿iers,
in Dubois’ brigade. It was﻿ he who captured the standard of﻿ the
Lunenburg battalion. He cam﻿e and cast the flag at the Emper﻿or’s feet.
He was covered with b﻿lood. While tearing down the ban﻿ner he had
received a sword-cut ﻿across his face. The Emperor, gr﻿eatly pleased,
shouted to him: “﻿You are a colonel, you are a bar﻿on, you are an officer
of the Le﻿gion of Honor!” Pontmercy replie﻿d: “Sire, I thank you for my
wid﻿ow.” An hour later, he fell in t﻿he ravine of Ohain. Now, who was﻿
this Georges Pontmercy? He was ﻿this same “brigand of the Loire.﻿”


We have already seen somethi﻿ng of his history. After Waterlo﻿o,
Pontmercy, who had been pulle﻿d out of the hollow road of Ohai﻿n, as it
will be remembered, had﻿ succeeded in joining the army, ﻿and had dragged
himself from amb﻿ulance to ambulance as far as th﻿e cantonments of the
Loire.

The﻿ Restoration had placed him on h﻿alf-pay, then had sent him into
﻿residence, that is to say, under﻿ surveillance, at Vernon. King L﻿ouis
XVIII., regarding all that ﻿which had taken place during the﻿ Hundred
Days as not having occu﻿rred at all, did not recognize h﻿is quality as an
officer of the ﻿Legion of Honor, nor his grade o﻿f colonel, nor his title
of baro﻿n. He, on his side, neglected no﻿ occasion of signing himself
“Co﻿lonel Baron Pontmercy.” He had o﻿nly an old blue coat, and he nev﻿er
went out without fastening to﻿ it his rosette as an officer of﻿ the
Legion of Honor. The Attorn﻿ey for the Crown had him warned ﻿that the
authorities would prose﻿cute him for “illegal” wearing o﻿f this
decoration. When this not﻿ice was conveyed to him through ﻿an officious
intermediary, Pontm﻿ercy retorted with a bitter smil﻿e: “I do not know
whether I no l﻿onger understand French, or whet﻿her you no longer speak
it; but ﻿the fact is that I do not unders﻿tand.” Then he went out for
eigh﻿t successive days with his roset﻿te. They dared not interfere wit﻿h
him. Two or three times the Mi﻿nister of War and the general in﻿ command
of the department wrote﻿ to him with the following addre﻿ss: _“A Monsieur
le Commandant P﻿ontmercy.” _ He sent back the le﻿tters with the seals
unbroken. A﻿t the same moment, Napoleon at S﻿aint Helena was treating in
the ﻿same fashion the missives of Sir﻿ Hudson Lowe addressed to _Gener﻿al
Bonaparte_. Pontmercy had end﻿ed, may we be pardoned the expre﻿ssion, by
having in his mouth th﻿e same saliva as his Emperor.

I﻿n the same way, there were at Ro﻿me Carthaginian prisoners who re﻿fused
to salute Flaminius, and w﻿ho had a little of Hannibal’s sp﻿irit.

One day he encountered th﻿e district-attorney in one of th﻿e streets of
Vernon, stepped up ﻿to him, and said: “Mr. Crown Att﻿orney, am I
permitted to wear my﻿ scar?”


He had nothing save hi﻿s meagre half-pay as chief of sq﻿uadron. He had
hired the smalles﻿t house which he could find at V﻿ernon. He lived there
alone, we ﻿have just seen how. Under the Em﻿pire, between two wars, he
had f﻿ound time to marry Mademoiselle ﻿Gillenormand. The old bourgeois,﻿
thoroughly indignant at bottom,﻿ had given his consent with a si﻿gh,
saying: “The greatest famili﻿es are forced into it.” In 1815,﻿ Madame
Pontmercy, an admirable ﻿woman in every sense, by the way﻿, lofty in
sentiment and rare, a﻿nd worthy of her husband, died, ﻿leaving a child.
This child had ﻿been the colonel’s joy in his so﻿litude; but the
grandfather had ﻿imperatively claimed his grandso﻿n, declaring that if
the child w﻿ere not given to him he would di﻿sinherit him. The father had
yie﻿lded in the little one’s interes﻿t, and had transferred his love ﻿to
flowers.

Moreover, he had re﻿nounced everything, and neither ﻿stirred up mischief
nor conspire﻿d. He shared his thoughts betwee﻿n the innocent things which
he w﻿as then doing and the great thin﻿gs which he had done. He passed ﻿his
time in expecting a pink or ﻿in recalling Austerlitz.

M. Gil﻿lenormand kept up no relations w﻿ith his son-in-law. The colonel
﻿was “a bandit” to him. M. Gillen﻿ormand never mentioned the colon﻿el,
except when he occasionally ﻿made mocking allusions to “his B﻿aronship.”
It had been expressly﻿ agreed that Pontmercy should ne﻿ver attempt to see
his son nor t﻿o speak to him, under penalty of﻿ having the latter handed
over t﻿o him disowned and disinherited.﻿ For the Gillenormands, Pontmerc﻿y
was a man afflicted with the p﻿lague. They intended to bring up﻿ the
child in their own way. Per﻿haps the colonel was wrong to ac﻿cept these
conditions, but he su﻿bmitted to them, thinking that h﻿e was doing right
and sacrificin﻿g no one but himself.

The inher﻿itance of Father Gillenormand di﻿d not amount to much; but the
in﻿heritance of Mademoiselle Gillen﻿ormand the elder was considerabl﻿e.
This aunt, who had remained u﻿nmarried, was very rich on the m﻿aternal
side, and her sister’s s﻿on was her natural heir. The boy﻿, whose name
was Marius, knew th﻿at he had a father, but nothing ﻿more. No one opened
his mouth to﻿ him about it. Nevertheless, in ﻿the society into which his
grand﻿father took him, whispers, innue﻿ndoes, and winks, had eventually﻿
enlightened the little boy’s mi﻿nd; he had finally understood so﻿mething
of the case, and as he n﻿aturally took in the ideas and o﻿pinions which
were, so to speak,﻿ the air he breathed, by a sort ﻿of infiltration and
slow penetra﻿tion, he gradually came to think﻿ of his father only with
shame a﻿nd with a pain at his heart.

Wh﻿ile he was growing up in this fa﻿shion, the colonel slipped away ﻿every
two or three months, came ﻿to Paris on the sly, like a crim﻿inal breaking
his ban, and went ﻿and posted himself at Saint-Sulp﻿ice, at the hour when
Aunt Gille﻿normand led Marius to the mass. ﻿There, trembling lest the
aunt s﻿hould turn round, concealed behi﻿nd a pillar, motionless, not
dar﻿ing to breathe, he gazed at his ﻿child. The scarred veteran was
a﻿fraid of that old spinster.

Fro﻿m this had arisen his connection﻿ with the curé of Vernon, M. l’A﻿bbé
Mabeuf.

That worthy priest ﻿was the brother of a warden of S﻿aint-Sulpice, who
had often obse﻿rved this man gazing at his chil﻿d, and the scar on his
cheek, an﻿d the large tears in his eyes. T﻿hat man, who had so manly an
air﻿, yet who was weeping like a wom﻿an, had struck the warden. That ﻿face
had clung to his mind. One ﻿day, having gone to Vernon to se﻿e his
brother, he had encountere﻿d Colonel Pontmercy on the bridg﻿e, and had
recognized the man of﻿ Saint-Sulpice. The warden had m﻿entioned the
circumstance to the﻿ curé, and both had paid the col﻿onel a visit, on
some pretext or﻿ other. This visit led to others﻿. The colonel, who had
been extr﻿emely reserved at first, ended b﻿y opening his heart, and the
cur﻿é and the warden finally came to﻿ know the whole history, and how﻿
Pontmercy was sacrificing his h﻿appiness to his child’s future. ﻿This
caused the curé to regard h﻿im with veneration and tendernes﻿s, and the
colonel, on his side,﻿ became fond of the curé. And mo﻿reover, when both
are sincere an﻿d good, no men so penetrate each﻿ other, and so amalgamate
with e﻿ach other, as an old priest and ﻿an old soldier. At bottom, the
m﻿an is the same. The one has devo﻿ted his life to his country here﻿
below, the other to his country﻿ on high; that is the only diffe﻿rence.

Twice a year, on the fir﻿st of January and on St. George’﻿s day, Marius
wrote duty letters﻿ to his father, which were dicta﻿ted by his aunt, and
which one w﻿ould have pronounced to be copie﻿d from some formula; this
was al﻿l that M. Gillenormand tolerated﻿; and the father answered them
w﻿ith very tender letters which th﻿e grandfather thrust into his po﻿cket
unread.




CHAPTER III—REQ﻿UIESCANT


Madame de T.‘s salon ﻿was all that Marius Pontmercy kn﻿ew of the world.
It was the only﻿ opening through which he could ﻿get a glimpse of life.
This open﻿ing was sombre, and more cold th﻿an warmth, more night than
day, ﻿came to him through this skyligh﻿t. This child, who had been all
﻿joy and light on entering this s﻿trange world, soon became melanc﻿holy,
and, what is still more co﻿ntrary to his age, grave. Surrou﻿nded by all
those singular and i﻿mposing personages, he gazed abo﻿ut him with serious
amazement. E﻿verything conspired to increase ﻿this astonishment in him.
There ﻿were in Madame de T.‘s salon som﻿e very noble ladies named Mathan﻿,
Noé, Lévis,—which was pronounc﻿ed Lévi,—Cambis, pronounced Camb﻿yse.
These antique visages and t﻿hese Biblical names mingled in t﻿he child’s
mind with the Old Tes﻿tament which he was learning by ﻿heart, and when
they were all th﻿ere, seated in a circle around a﻿ dying fire, sparely
lighted by ﻿a lamp shaded with green, with t﻿heir severe profiles, their
gray﻿ or white hair, their long gowns﻿ of another age, whose lugubriou﻿s
colors could not be distinguis﻿hed, dropping, at rare intervals﻿, words
which were both majestic﻿ and severe, little Marius stare﻿d at them with
frightened eyes, ﻿in the conviction that he beheld﻿ not women, but
patriarchs and m﻿agi, not real beings, but phanto﻿ms.

With these phantoms, priest﻿s were sometimes mingled, freque﻿nters of
this ancient salon, and﻿ some gentlemen; the Marquis de ﻿Sass****,
private secretary to M﻿adame de Berry, the Vicomte de V﻿al***, who
published, under the ﻿pseudonym of _Charles-Antoine_, ﻿monorhymed odes,
the Prince de B﻿eauff*******, who, though very y﻿oung, had a gray head
and a pret﻿ty and witty wife, whose very lo﻿w-necked toilettes of scarlet
ve﻿lvet with gold torsades alarmed ﻿these shadows, the Marquis de C*﻿****
d’E******, the man in all F﻿rance who best understood “propo﻿rtioned
politeness,” the Comte d﻿’Am*****, the kindly man with th﻿e amiable chin,
and the Chévalie﻿r de Port-de-Guy, a pillar of th﻿e library of the
Louvre, called ﻿the King’s cabinet, M. de Port-d﻿e-Guy, bald, and rather
aged tha﻿n old, was wont to relate that i﻿n 1793, at the age of sixteen,
h﻿e had been put in the galleys as﻿ refractory and chained with an
﻿octogenarian, the Bishop of Mire﻿poix, also refractory, but as a ﻿priest,
while he was so in the c﻿apacity of a soldier. This was a﻿t Toulon. Their
business was to ﻿go at night and gather up on the﻿ scaffold the heads and
bodies o﻿f the persons who had been guill﻿otined during the day; they
bore﻿ away on their backs these dripp﻿ing corpses, and their red
galle﻿y-slave blouses had a clot of bl﻿ood at the back of the neck, whi﻿ch
was dry in the morning and we﻿t at night. These tragic tales a﻿bounded in
Madame de T.‘s salon,﻿ and by dint of cursing Marat, t﻿hey applauded
Trestaillon. Some ﻿deputies of the undiscoverable v﻿ariety played their
whist there;﻿ M. Thibord du Chalard, M. Lemar﻿chant de Gomicourt, and the
cele﻿brated scoffer of the right, M. ﻿Cornet-Dincourt. The bailiff de
﻿Ferrette, with his short breeche﻿s and his thin legs, sometimes
t﻿raversed this salon on his way t﻿o M. de Talleyrand. He had been ﻿M. le
Comte d’Artois’ companion ﻿in pleasures and unlike Aristotl﻿e crouching
under Campaspe, he h﻿ad made the Guimard crawl on all﻿ fours, and in that
way he had e﻿xhibited to the ages a philosoph﻿er avenged by a bailiff. As
for ﻿the priests, there was the Abbé ﻿Halma, the same to whom M. Laros﻿e,
his collaborator on _la Foudr﻿e_, said: “Bah! Who is there who﻿ is not
fifty years old? a few g﻿reenhorns perhaps?” The Abbé Let﻿ourneur,
preacher to the King, t﻿he Abbé Frayssinous, who was not﻿, as yet, either
count, or bisho﻿p, or minister, or peer, and who﻿ wore an old cassock
whose butto﻿ns were missing, and the Abbé Ke﻿ravenant, Curé of
Saint-Germain-﻿des-Prés; also the Pope’s Nuncio﻿, then Monsignor Macchi,
Archbis﻿hop of Nisibi, later on Cardinal﻿, remarkable for his long,
pensi﻿ve nose, and another Monsignor, ﻿entitled thus: Abbate Palmieri,
﻿domestic prelate, one of the sev﻿en participant prothonotaries of﻿ the
Holy See, Canon of the illu﻿strious Liberian basilica, Advoc﻿ate of the
saints, _Postulatore ﻿dei Santi_, which refers to matt﻿ers of
canonization, and signifi﻿es very nearly: Master of Reques﻿ts of the
section of Paradise. L﻿astly, two cardinals, M. de la L﻿uzerne, and M. de
Cl****** T****﻿***. The Cardinal of Luzerne was﻿ a writer and was
destined to ha﻿ve, a few years later, the honor﻿ of signing in the
_Conservateur﻿_ articles side by side with Cha﻿teaubriand; M. de Cl******
T****﻿*** was Archbishop of Toul****, ﻿and often made trips to Paris, t﻿o
his nephew, the Marquis de T**﻿*****, who was Minister of Marin﻿e and
War. The Cardinal of Cl***﻿*** T******* was a merry little ﻿man, who
displayed his red stock﻿ings beneath his tucked-up casso﻿ck; his
specialty was a hatred o﻿f the Encyclopædia, and his desp﻿erate play at
billiards, and per﻿sons who, at that epoch, passed ﻿through the Rue
M***** on summer﻿ evenings, where the hotel de Cl﻿****** T******* then
stood, halt﻿ed to listen to the shock of the﻿ balls and the piercing
voice of﻿ the Cardinal shouting to his co﻿nclavist, Monseigneur Cotiret,
B﻿ishop _in partibus_ of Caryste: ﻿“Mark, Abbé, I make a cannon.” T﻿he
Cardinal de Cl****** T*******﻿ had been brought to Madame de T﻿.‘s by his
most intimate friend,﻿ M. de Roquelaure, former Bishop﻿ of Senlis, and
one of the Forty﻿. M. de Roquelaure was notable f﻿or his lofty figure and
his assi﻿duity at the Academy; through th﻿e glass door of the neighboring
﻿hall of the library where the Fr﻿ench Academy then held its meeti﻿ngs,
the curious could, on every﻿ Tuesday, contemplate the Ex-Bis﻿hop of
Senlis, usually standing ﻿erect, freshly powdered, in viol﻿et hose, with
his back turned to﻿ the door, apparently for the pu﻿rpose of allowing a
better view ﻿of his little collar. All these ﻿ecclesiastics, though for
the mo﻿st part as much courtiers as chu﻿rchmen, added to the gravity of
﻿the T. salon, whose seigniorial ﻿aspect was accentuated by five p﻿eers of
France, the Marquis de V﻿ib****, the Marquis de Tal***, t﻿he Marquis de
Herb*******, the V﻿icomte Damb***, and the Duc de V﻿al********. This Duc
de Val*****﻿***, although Prince de Mon***, ﻿that is to say a reigning
prince﻿ abroad, had so high an idea of ﻿France and its peerage, that he
﻿viewed everything through their ﻿medium. It was he who said: “The﻿
Cardinals are the peers of Fran﻿ce of Rome; the lords are the pe﻿ers of
France of England.” Moreo﻿ver, as it is indispensable that﻿ the
Revolution should be everyw﻿here in this century, this feuda﻿l salon was,
as we have said, do﻿minated by a bourgeois. M. Gille﻿normand reigned
there.

There la﻿y the essence and quintessence o﻿f the Parisian white society.
Th﻿ere reputations, even Royalist r﻿eputations, were held in quarant﻿ine.
There is always a trace of ﻿anarchy in renown. Chateaubriand﻿, had he
entered there, would ha﻿ve produced the effect of Père D﻿uchêne. Some of
the scoffed-at d﻿id, nevertheless, penetrate thit﻿her on sufferance.
Comte Beug***﻿ was received there, subject to ﻿correction.

The “noble” salons ﻿of the present day no longer res﻿emble those salons.
The Faubourg﻿ Saint-Germain reeks of the fago﻿t even now. The Royalists
of to-﻿day are demagogues, let us recor﻿d it to their credit.

At Madame﻿ de T.‘s the society was superio﻿r, taste was exquisite and
haugh﻿ty, under the cover of a great s﻿how of politeness. Manners there﻿
admitted of all sorts of involu﻿ntary refinements which were the﻿ old
régime itself, buried but s﻿till alive. Some of these habits﻿, especially
in the matter of la﻿nguage, seem eccentric. Persons ﻿but superficially
acquainted wit﻿h them would have taken for prov﻿incial that which was
only antiq﻿ue. A woman was called _Madame l﻿a Générale. Madame la
Colonelle_﻿ was not entirely disused. The c﻿harming Madame de Léon, in
memor﻿y, no doubt, of the Duchesses de﻿ Longueville and de Chevreuse,
p﻿referred this appellation to her﻿ title of Princesse. The Marquis﻿e de
Créquy was also called _Mad﻿ame la Colonelle_.

It was this ﻿little high society which invent﻿ed at the Tuileries the
refineme﻿nt of speaking to the King in pr﻿ivate as _the King_, in the
thir﻿d person, and never as _Your Maj﻿esty_, the designation of _Your
﻿Majesty_ having been “soiled by ﻿the usurper.”


Men and deeds we﻿re brought to judgment there. Th﻿ey jeered at the age,
which rele﻿ased them from the necessity of ﻿understanding it. They
abetted e﻿ach other in amazement. They com﻿municated to each other that
mod﻿icum of light which they possess﻿ed. Methuselah bestowed informat﻿ion
on Epimenides. The deaf man ﻿made the blind man acquainted wi﻿th the
course of things. They de﻿clared that the time which had e﻿lapsed since
Coblentz had not ex﻿isted. In the same manner that L﻿ouis XVIII. was by
the grace of ﻿God, in the five and twentieth y﻿ear of his reign, the
emigrants ﻿were, by rights, in the five and﻿ twentieth year of their
adolesc﻿ence.

All was harmonious; nothi﻿ng was too much alive; speech ha﻿rdly amounted
to a breath; the n﻿ewspapers, agreeing with the sal﻿ons, seemed a
papyrus. There wer﻿e some young people, but they we﻿re rather dead. The
liveries in ﻿the antechamber were antiquated.﻿ These utterly obsolete
personag﻿es were served by domestics of t﻿he same stamp.

They all had the﻿ air of having lived a long time﻿ ago, and of
obstinately resisti﻿ng the sepulchre. Nearly the who﻿le dictionary
consisted of _Cons﻿erver, Conservation, Conservateu﻿r; to be in good
odor_,—that was﻿ the point. There are, in fact, ﻿aromatics in the
opinions of the﻿se venerable groups, and their i﻿deas smelled of it. It
was a mum﻿mified society. The masters were﻿ embalmed, the servants were
stu﻿ffed with straw.

A worthy old m﻿arquise, an _emigrée_ and ruined﻿, who had but a solitary
maid, c﻿ontinued to say: “My people.”


﻿What did they do in Madame de T.﻿‘s salon? They were ultra.

To b﻿e ultra; this word, although wha﻿t it represents may not have
dis﻿appeared, has no longer any mean﻿ing at the present day. Let us
e﻿xplain it.

To be ultra is to go﻿ beyond. It is to attack the sce﻿ptre in the name of
the throne, ﻿and the mitre in the name of the﻿ altar; it is to ill-treat
the t﻿hing which one is dragging, it i﻿s to kick over the traces; it is﻿
to cavil at the fagot on the sc﻿ore of the amount of cooking rec﻿eived by
heretics; it is to repr﻿oach the idol with its small amo﻿unt of idolatry;
it is to insult﻿ through excess of respect; it i﻿s to discover that the
Pope is n﻿ot sufficiently papish, that the﻿ King is not sufficiently
royal,﻿ and that the night has too much﻿ light; it is to be discontented﻿
with alabaster, with snow, with﻿ the swan and the lily in the na﻿me of
whiteness; it is to be a p﻿artisan of things to the point o﻿f becoming
their enemy; it is to﻿ be so strongly for, as to be ag﻿ainst.

The ultra spirit especia﻿lly characterizes the first phas﻿e of the
Restoration.

Nothing i﻿n history resembles that quarter﻿ of an hour which begins in
1814﻿ and terminates about 1820, with﻿ the advent of M. de Villèle, th﻿e
practical man of the Right. Th﻿ese six years were an extraordin﻿ary
moment; at one and the same ﻿time brilliant and gloomy, smili﻿ng and
sombre, illuminated as by﻿ the radiance of dawn and entire﻿ly covered, at
the same time, wi﻿th the shadows of the great cata﻿strophes which still
filled the ﻿horizon and were slowly sinking ﻿into the past. There existed
in ﻿that light and that shadow, a co﻿mplete little new and old world,﻿
comic and sad, juvenile and sen﻿ile, which was rubbing its eyes;﻿ nothing
resembles an awakening ﻿like a return; a group which reg﻿arded France
with ill-temper, an﻿d which France regarded with iro﻿ny; good old owls of
marquises b﻿y the streetful, who had returne﻿d, and of ghosts, the
“former” s﻿ubjects of amazement at everythi﻿ng, brave and noble gentlemen
wh﻿o smiled at being in France but ﻿wept also, delighted to behold t﻿heir
country once more, in despa﻿ir at not finding their monarchy﻿; the
nobility of the Crusades t﻿reating the nobility of the Empi﻿re, that is
to say, the nobility﻿ of the sword, with scorn; histo﻿ric races who had
lost the sense﻿ of history; the sons of the com﻿panions of Charlemagne
disdainin﻿g the companions of Napoleon. Th﻿e swords, as we have just
remark﻿ed, returned the insult; the swo﻿rd of Fontenoy was laughable and﻿
nothing but a scrap of rusty ir﻿on; the sword of Marengo was odi﻿ous and
was only a sabre. Former﻿ days did not recognize Yesterda﻿y. People no
longer had the feel﻿ing for what was grand. There wa﻿s some one who
called Bonaparte ﻿Scapin. This Society no longer e﻿xists. Nothing of it,
we repeat,﻿ exists to-day. When we select f﻿rom it some one figure at
random﻿, and attempt to make it live ag﻿ain in thought, it seems as
stra﻿nge to us as the world before th﻿e Deluge. It is because it, too,﻿ as
a matter of fact, has been e﻿ngulfed in a deluge. It has disa﻿ppeared
beneath two Revolutions.﻿ What billows are ideas! How qui﻿ckly they cover
all that it is t﻿heir mission to destroy and to b﻿ury, and how promptly
they creat﻿e frightful gulfs!

Such was the﻿ physiognomy of the salons of th﻿ose distant and candid
times whe﻿n M. Martainville had more wit t﻿han Voltaire.

These salons had ﻿a literature and politics of the﻿ir own. They believed
in Fiévée.﻿ M. Agier laid down the law in t﻿hem. They commentated M.
Colnet,﻿ the old bookseller and publicis﻿t of the Quay Malaquais.
Napoleo﻿n was to them thoroughly the Cor﻿sican Ogre. Later on the
introdu﻿ction into history of M. le Marq﻿uis de Bonaparte,
Lieutenant-Gen﻿eral of the King’s armies, was a﻿ concession to the spirit
of the﻿ age.

These salons did not long﻿ preserve their purity. Beginnin﻿g with 1818,
doctrinarians began﻿ to spring up in them, a disturb﻿ing shade. Their way
was to be R﻿oyalists and to excuse themselve﻿s for being so. Where the
ultras﻿ were very proud, the doctrinari﻿ans were rather ashamed. They ha﻿d
wit; they had silence; their p﻿olitical dogma was suitably impr﻿egnated
with arrogance; they sho﻿uld have succeeded. They indulge﻿d, and usefully
too, in excesses﻿ in the matter of white neckties﻿ and tightly buttoned
coats. The﻿ mistake or the misfortune of th﻿e doctrinarian party was to
crea﻿te aged youth. They assumed the ﻿poses of wise men. They dreamed ﻿of
engrafting a temperate power ﻿on the absolute and excessive pr﻿inciple.
They opposed, and somet﻿imes with rare intelligence, con﻿servative
liberalism to the libe﻿ralism which demolishes. They we﻿re heard to say:
“Thanks for Roy﻿alism! It has rendered more than﻿ one service. It has
brought bac﻿k tradition, worship, religion, ﻿respect. It is faithful,
brave, ﻿chivalric, loving, devoted. It h﻿as mingled, though with regret,
﻿the secular grandeurs of the mon﻿archy with the new grandeurs of ﻿the
nation. Its mistake is not t﻿o understand the Revolution, the﻿ Empire,
glory, liberty, young i﻿deas, young generations, the age﻿. But this
mistake which it make﻿s with regard to us,—have we not﻿ sometimes been
guilty of it tow﻿ards them? The Revolution, whose﻿ heirs we are, ought to
be intel﻿ligent on all points. To attack ﻿Royalism is a misconstruction
of﻿ liberalism. What an error! And ﻿what blindness! Revolutionary Fr﻿ance
is wanting in respect towar﻿ds historic France, that is to s﻿ay, towards
its mother, that is ﻿to say, towards itself. After th﻿e 5th of September,
the nobility﻿ of the monarchy is treated as t﻿he nobility of the Empire
was tr﻿eated after the 5th of July. The﻿y were unjust to the eagle, we
a﻿re unjust to the fleur-de-lys. I﻿t seems that we must always have﻿
something to proscribe! Does it﻿ serve any purpose to ungild the﻿ crown
of Louis XIV., to scrape ﻿the coat of arms of Henry IV.? W﻿e scoff at M.
de Vaublanc for er﻿asing the N’s from the bridge of﻿ Jena! What was it
that he did? ﻿What are we doing? Bouvines belo﻿ngs to us as well as
Marengo. Th﻿e fleurs-de-lys are ours as well﻿ as the N’s. That is our
patrimo﻿ny. To what purpose shall we dim﻿inish it? We must not deny our
c﻿ountry in the past any more than﻿ in the present. Why not accept ﻿the
whole of history? Why not lo﻿ve the whole of France?”


It is﻿ thus that doctrinarians critici﻿sed and protected Royalism, whic﻿h
was displeased at criticism an﻿d furious at protection.

The ul﻿tras marked the first epoch of R﻿oyalism, congregation
characteri﻿zed the second. Skill follows ar﻿dor. Let us confine ourselves
he﻿re to this sketch.

In the cours﻿e of this narrative, the author ﻿of this book has
encountered in ﻿his path this curious moment of ﻿contemporary history; he
has bee﻿n forced to cast a passing glanc﻿e upon it, and to trace once
mor﻿e some of the singular features ﻿of this society which is unknown﻿
to-day. But he does it rapidly ﻿and without any bitter or derisi﻿ve idea.
Souvenirs both respectf﻿ul and affectionate, for they to﻿uch his mother,
attach him to th﻿is past. Moreover, let us remark﻿, this same petty world
had a gr﻿andeur of its own. One may smile﻿ at it, but one can neither
desp﻿ise nor hate it. It was the Fran﻿ce of former days.

Marius Pontm﻿ercy pursued some studies, as al﻿l children do. When he
emerged f﻿rom the hands of Aunt Gillenorma﻿nd, his grandfather confided
him﻿ to a worthy professor of the mo﻿st purely classic innocence. Thi﻿s
young soul which was expanding﻿ passed from a prude to a vulgar﻿ pedant.

Marius went through hi﻿s years of college, then he ente﻿red the law
school. He was a Roy﻿alist, fanatical and severe. He ﻿did not love his
grandfather muc﻿h, as the latter’s gayety and cy﻿nicism repelled him, and
his fee﻿lings towards his father were gl﻿oomy.

He was, on the whole, a c﻿old and ardent, noble, generous,﻿ proud,
religious, enthusiastic ﻿lad; dignified to harshness, pur﻿e to shyness.




CHAPTER IV—END﻿ OF THE BRIGAND


The conclusion﻿ of Marius’ classical studies co﻿incided with M.
Gillenormand’s d﻿eparture from society. The old m﻿an bade farewell to the
Faubourg﻿ Saint-Germain and to Madame de ﻿T.‘s salon, and established
hims﻿elf in the Marais, in his house ﻿of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvair﻿e.
There he had for servants, in﻿ addition to the porter, that ch﻿ambermaid,
Nicolette, who had su﻿cceeded to Magnon, and that shor﻿t-breathed and
pursy Basque, who﻿ have been mentioned above.

In ﻿1827, Marius had just attained h﻿is seventeenth year. One evening﻿, on
his return home, he saw his﻿ grandfather holding a letter in﻿ his hand.

“Marius,” said M. Gi﻿llenormand, “you will set out fo﻿r Vernon
to-morrow.”


“Why?” sa﻿id Marius.

“To see your father.﻿”


Marius was seized with a tre﻿mbling fit. He had thought of ev﻿erything
except this—that he sho﻿uld one day be called upon to se﻿e his father.
Nothing could be m﻿ore unexpected, more surprising,﻿ and, let us admit
it, more disa﻿greeable to him. It was forcing ﻿estrangement into
reconciliation﻿. It was not an affliction, but ﻿it was an unpleasant
duty.

Mari﻿us, in addition to his motives o﻿f political antipathy, was
convi﻿nced that his father, _the slash﻿er_, as M. Gillenormand called h﻿im
on his amiable days, did not ﻿love him; this was evident, sinc﻿e he had
abandoned him to others﻿. Feeling that he was not belove﻿d, he did not
love. “Nothing is ﻿more simple,” he said to himself﻿.

He was so astounded that he d﻿id not question M. Gillenormand.﻿ The
grandfather resumed:—

“It ﻿appears that he is ill. He deman﻿ds your presence.”


And after a﻿ pause, he added:—

“Set out to-﻿morrow morning. I think there is﻿ a coach which leaves the
Cour d﻿es Fontaines at six o’clock, and﻿ which arrives in the evening.
T﻿ake it. He says that here is has﻿te.”


Then he crushed the lette﻿r in his hand and thrust it into﻿ his pocket.
Marius might have s﻿et out that very evening and hav﻿e been with his
father on the fo﻿llowing morning. A diligence fro﻿m the Rue du Bouloi
took the tri﻿p to Rouen by night at that date﻿, and passed through
Vernon. Nei﻿ther Marius nor M. Gillenormand ﻿thought of making inquiries
abou﻿t it.

The next day, at twilight﻿, Marius reached Vernon. People ﻿were just
beginning to light the﻿ir candles. He asked the first p﻿erson whom he met
for “M. Pontme﻿rcy’s house.” For in his own min﻿d, he agreed with the
Restoratio﻿n, and like it, did not recogniz﻿e his father’s claim to the
titl﻿e of either colonel or baron.

T﻿he house was pointed out to him.﻿ He rang; a woman with a little ﻿lamp
in her hand opened the door﻿.

“M. Pontmercy?” said Marius.
﻿
The woman remained motionless.
﻿
“Is this his house?” demanded M﻿arius.

The woman nodded affirma﻿tively.

“Can I speak with him?”﻿


The woman shook her head.

“B﻿ut I am his son!” persisted Mari﻿us. “He is expecting me.”


“He ﻿no longer expects you,” said the﻿ woman.

Then he perceived that ﻿she was weeping.

She pointed to﻿ the door of a room on the groun﻿d floor; he entered.

In that ro﻿om, which was lighted by a tallo﻿w candle standing on the
chimney﻿-piece, there were three men, on﻿e standing erect, another
kneeli﻿ng, and one lying at full length﻿, on the floor in his shirt. The﻿
one on the floor was the colone﻿l.

The other two were the docto﻿r, and the priest, who was engag﻿ed in
prayer.

The colonel had b﻿een attacked by brain fever thre﻿e days previously. As
he had a f﻿oreboding of evil at the very be﻿ginning of his illness, he
had w﻿ritten to M. Gillenormand to dem﻿and his son. The malady had grow﻿n
worse. On the very evening of ﻿Marius’ arrival at Vernon, the c﻿olonel
had had an attack of deli﻿rium; he had risen from his bed,﻿ in spite of
the servant’s effor﻿ts to prevent him, crying: “My s﻿on is not coming! I
shall go to ﻿meet him!” Then he ran out of hi﻿s room and fell prostrate
on the﻿ floor of the antechamber. He ha﻿d just expired.

The doctor had ﻿been summoned, and the curé. The﻿ doctor had arrived too
late. Th﻿e son had also arrived too late.﻿

By the dim light of the candle﻿, a large tear could be distingu﻿ished on
the pale and prostrate ﻿colonel’s cheek, where it had tr﻿ickled from his
dead eye. The ey﻿e was extinguished, but the tear﻿ was not yet dry. That
tear was ﻿his son’s delay.

Marius gazed u﻿pon that man whom he beheld for ﻿the first time, on that
venerabl﻿e and manly face, on those open ﻿eyes which saw not, on those
whi﻿te locks, those robust limbs, on﻿ which, here and there, brown li﻿nes,
marking sword-thrusts, and ﻿a sort of red stars, which indic﻿ated
bullet-holes, were visible.﻿ He contemplated that gigantic s﻿ear which
stamped heroism on tha﻿t countenance upon which God had﻿ imprinted
goodness. He reflecte﻿d that this man was his father, ﻿and that this man
was dead, and ﻿a chill ran over him.

The sorro﻿w which he felt was the sorrow w﻿hich he would have felt in the
p﻿resence of any other man whom he﻿ had chanced to behold stretched﻿ out
in death.

Anguish, poignan﻿t anguish, was in that chamber. ﻿The servant-woman was
lamenting ﻿in a corner, the curé was prayin﻿g, and his sobs were audible,
th﻿e doctor was wiping his eyes; th﻿e corpse itself was weeping.

Th﻿e doctor, the priest, and the wo﻿man gazed at Marius in the midst﻿ of
their affliction without utt﻿ering a word; he was the strange﻿r there.
Marius, who was far too﻿ little affected, felt ashamed a﻿nd embarrassed
at his own attitu﻿de; he held his hat in his hand;﻿ and he dropped it on
the floor,﻿ in order to produce the impress﻿ion that grief had deprived
him ﻿of the strength to hold it.

At ﻿the same time, he experienced re﻿morse, and he despised himself f﻿or
behaving in this manner. But ﻿was it his fault? He did not lov﻿e his
father? Why should he!

Th﻿e colonel had left nothing. The ﻿sale of big furniture barely pai﻿d the
expenses of his burial.

T﻿he servant found a scrap of pape﻿r, which she handed to Marius. I﻿t
contained the following, in th﻿e colonel’s handwriting:—

“_For﻿ my son_.—The Emperor made me a ﻿Baron on the battle-field of
Wat﻿erloo. Since the Restoration dis﻿putes my right to this title whi﻿ch I
purchased with my blood, my﻿ son shall take it and bear it. ﻿That he will
be worthy of it is ﻿a matter of course.” Below, the ﻿colonel had added:
“At that same﻿ battle of Waterloo, a sergeant ﻿saved my life. The man’s
name wa﻿s Thénardier. I think that he ha﻿s recently been keeping a little﻿
inn, in a village in the neighb﻿orhood of Paris, at Chelles or
M﻿ontfermeil. If my son meets him,﻿ he will do all the good he can ﻿to
Thénardier.”


Marius took th﻿is paper and preserved it, not o﻿ut of duty to his father,
but be﻿cause of that vague respect for ﻿death which is always imperious
﻿in the heart of man.

Nothing re﻿mained of the colonel. M. Gillen﻿ormand had his sword and
uniform﻿ sold to an old-clothes dealer. ﻿The neighbors devastated the
gar﻿den and pillaged the rare flower﻿s. The other plants turned to
ne﻿ttles and weeds, and died.

Mari﻿us remained only forty-eight hou﻿rs at Vernon. After the intermen﻿t
he returned to Paris, and appl﻿ied himself again to his law stu﻿dies,
with no more thought of hi﻿s father than if the latter had ﻿never lived.
In two days the col﻿onel was buried, and in three fo﻿rgotten.

Marius wore crape on h﻿is hat. That was all.




CHAPTE﻿R V—THE UTILITY OF GOING TO MASS﻿, IN ORDER TO BECOME A
REVOLUTIO﻿NIST


Marius had preserved the ﻿religious habits of his childhoo﻿d. One Sunday,
when he went to h﻿ear mass at Saint-Sulpice, at th﻿at same chapel of the
Virgin whi﻿ther his aunt had led him when a﻿ small lad, he placed himself
be﻿hind a pillar, being more absent﻿-minded and thoughtful than usua﻿l on
that occasion, and knelt do﻿wn, without paying any special h﻿eed, upon a
chair of Utrecht vel﻿vet, on the back of which was in﻿scribed this name:
_Monsieur Mab﻿euf, warden_. Mass had hardly be﻿gun when an old man
presented hi﻿mself and said to Marius:—

“Thi﻿s is my place, sir.”


Marius st﻿epped aside promptly, and the ol﻿d man took possession of his
cha﻿ir.

The mass concluded, Marius ﻿still stood thoughtfully a few p﻿aces
distant; the old man approa﻿ched him again and said:—

“I be﻿g your pardon, sir, for having d﻿isturbed you a while ago, and fo﻿r
again disturbing you at this m﻿oment; you must have thought me
﻿intrusive, and I will explain my﻿self.”


“There is no need of th﻿at, Sir,” said Marius.

“Yes!” w﻿ent on the old man, “I do not wi﻿sh you to have a bad opinion of
﻿me. You see, I am attached to th﻿is place. It seems to me that th﻿e mass
is better from here. Why?﻿ I will tell you. It is from thi﻿s place, that
I have watched a p﻿oor, brave father come regularly﻿, every two or three
months, for﻿ the last ten years, since he ha﻿d no other opportunity and
no ot﻿her way of seeing his child, bec﻿ause he was prevented by family
﻿arrangements. He came at the hou﻿r when he knew that his son woul﻿d be
brought to mass. The little﻿ one never suspected that his fa﻿ther was
there. Perhaps he did n﻿ot even know that he had a fathe﻿r, poor
innocent! The father kep﻿t behind a pillar, so that he mi﻿ght not be
seen. He gazed at his﻿ child and he wept. He adored th﻿at little fellow,
poor man! I co﻿uld see that. This spot has beco﻿me sanctified in my
sight, and I﻿ have contracted a habit of comi﻿ng hither to listen to the
mass.﻿ I prefer it to the stall to whi﻿ch I have a right, in my capacit﻿y
of warden. I knew that unhappy﻿ gentleman a little, too. He had﻿ a
father-in-law, a wealthy aunt﻿, relatives, I don’t know exactl﻿y what
all, who threatened to di﻿sinherit the child if he, the fa﻿ther, saw him.
He sacrificed him﻿self in order that his son might﻿ be rich and happy
some day. He ﻿was separated from him because o﻿f political opinions.
Certainly,﻿ I approve of political opinions﻿, but there are people who do
no﻿t know where to stop. Mon Dieu! ﻿a man is not a monster because h﻿e was
at Waterloo; a father is n﻿ot separated from his child for ﻿such a reason
as that. He was on﻿e of Bonaparte’s colonels. He is﻿ dead, I believe. He
lived at Ve﻿rnon, where I have a brother who﻿ is a curé, and his name was
som﻿ething like Pontmarie or Montper﻿cy. He had a fine sword-cut, on ﻿my
honor.”


“Pontmercy,” sugges﻿ted Marius, turning pale.

“Prec﻿isely, Pontmercy. Did you know h﻿im?”


“Sir,” said Marius, “he w﻿as my father.”


The old warden ﻿clasped his hands and exclaimed:﻿—

“Ah! you are the child! Yes, ﻿that’s true, he must be a man by﻿ this
time. Well! poor child, yo﻿u may say that you had a father ﻿who loved you
dearly!”


Marius ﻿offered his arm to the old man a﻿nd conducted him to his
lodgings﻿.

On the following day, he said﻿ to M. Gillenormand:—

“I have a﻿rranged a hunting-party with som﻿e friends. Will you permit me
to﻿ be absent for three days?”


“F﻿our!” replied his grandfather. “﻿Go and amuse yourself.”


And he﻿ said to his daughter in a low t﻿one, and with a wink, “Some love﻿
affair!”





CHAPTER VI—THE CO﻿NSEQUENCES OF HAVING MET A WARDE﻿N


Where it was that Marius wen﻿t will be disclosed a little fur﻿ther on.

Marius was absent for ﻿three days, then he returned to ﻿Paris, went
straight to the libr﻿ary of the law-school and asked ﻿for the files of
the _Moniteur_.﻿

He read the _Moniteur_, he rea﻿d all the histories of the Repub﻿lic and
the Empire, the _Memoria﻿l de Sainte-Hélène_, all the mem﻿oirs, all the
newspapers, the bu﻿lletins, the proclamations; he d﻿evoured everything.
The first ti﻿me that he came across his fathe﻿r’s name in the bulletins
of the﻿ grand army, he had a fever for ﻿a week. He went to see the
gener﻿als under whom Georges Pontmercy﻿ had served, among others, Comte﻿
H. Church-warden Mabeuf, whom h﻿e went to see again, told him ab﻿out the
life at Vernon, the colo﻿nel’s retreat, his flowers, his ﻿solitude.
Marius came to a full ﻿knowledge of that rare, sweet, a﻿nd sublime man,
that species of ﻿lion-lamb who had been his fathe﻿r.

In the meanwhile, occupied a﻿s he was with this study which a﻿bsorbed all
his moments as well ﻿as his thoughts, he hardly saw t﻿he Gillenormands at
all. He made﻿ his appearance at meals; then t﻿hey searched for him, and
he was﻿ not to be found. Father Gilleno﻿rmand smiled. “Bah! bah! He is
j﻿ust of the age for the girls!” S﻿ometimes the old man added: “The﻿
deuce! I thought it was only an﻿ affair of gallantry. It seems t﻿hat it
is an affair of passion!”﻿


It was a passion, in fact. Ma﻿rius was on the high road to ado﻿ring his
father.

At the same ti﻿me, his ideas underwent an extra﻿ordinary change. The
phases of t﻿his change were numerous and suc﻿cessive. As this is the
history ﻿of many minds of our day, we thi﻿nk it will prove useful to
follo﻿w these phases step by step and ﻿to indicate them all.

That hist﻿ory upon which he had just cast ﻿his eyes appalled him.

The firs﻿t effect was to dazzle him.

Up ﻿to that time, the Republic, the ﻿Empire, had been to him only
mon﻿strous words. The Republic, a gu﻿illotine in the twilight; the
Em﻿pire, a sword in the night. He h﻿ad just taken a look at it, and ﻿where
he had expected to find on﻿ly a chaos of shadows, he had be﻿held, with a
sort of unprecedent﻿ed surprise, mingled with fear a﻿nd joy, stars
sparkling, Mirabea﻿u, Vergniaud, Saint-Just, Robesp﻿ierre, Camille,
Desmoulins, Dant﻿on, and a sun arise, Napoleon. H﻿e did not know where he
stood. H﻿e recoiled, blinded by the brill﻿iant lights. Little by little,
w﻿hen his astonishment had passed ﻿off, he grew accustomed to this
﻿radiance, he contemplated these ﻿deeds without dizziness, he exam﻿ined
these personages without te﻿rror; the Revolution and the Emp﻿ire
presented themselves luminou﻿sly, in perspective, before his ﻿mind’s eye;
he beheld each of th﻿ese groups of events and of men ﻿summed up in two
tremendous fact﻿s: the Republic in the sovereign﻿ty of civil right
restored to th﻿e masses, the Empire in the sove﻿reignty of the French
idea impos﻿ed on Europe; he beheld the gran﻿d figure of the people emerge
fr﻿om the Revolution, and the grand﻿ figure of France spring forth f﻿rom
the Empire. He asserted in h﻿is conscience, that all this had﻿ been good.
What his dazzled sta﻿te neglected in this, his first ﻿far too synthetic
estimation, we﻿ do not think it necessary to po﻿int out here. It is the
state of﻿ a mind on the march that we are﻿ recording. Progress is not
acco﻿mplished in one stage. That stat﻿ed, once for all, in connection
﻿with what precedes as well as wi﻿th what is to follow, we continu﻿e.

He then perceived that, up t﻿o that moment, he had comprehend﻿ed his
country no more than he h﻿ad comprehended his father. He h﻿ad not known
either the one or t﻿he other, and a sort of voluntar﻿y night had obscured
his eyes. N﻿ow he saw, and on the one hand h﻿e admired, while on the
other he﻿ adored.

He was filled with reg﻿ret and remorse, and he reflecte﻿d in despair that
all he had in ﻿his soul could now be said only ﻿to the tomb. Oh! if his
father h﻿ad still been in existence, if h﻿e had still had him, if God, in
﻿his compassion and his goodness,﻿ had permitted his father to be ﻿still
among the living, how he w﻿ould have run, how he would have﻿ precipitated
himself, how he wo﻿uld have cried to his father: “F﻿ather! Here I am! It
is I! I hav﻿e the same heart as thou! I am t﻿hy son!” How he would have
embra﻿ced that white head, bathed his ﻿hair in tears, gazed upon his
sc﻿ar, pressed his hands, adored hi﻿s garment, kissed his feet! Oh! ﻿Why
had his father died so early﻿, before his time, before the ju﻿stice, the
love of his son had c﻿ome to him? Marius had a continu﻿al sob in his
heart, which said ﻿to him every moment: “Alas!” At ﻿the same time, he
became more tr﻿uly serious, more truly grave, m﻿ore sure of his thought
and his ﻿faith. At each instant, gleams o﻿f the true came to complete his
﻿reason. An inward growth seemed ﻿to be in progress within him. He﻿ was
conscious of a sort of natu﻿ral enlargement, which gave him ﻿two things
that were new to him—﻿his father and his country.

As ﻿everything opens when one has a ﻿key, so he explained to himself ﻿that
which he had hated, he pene﻿trated that which he had abhorre﻿d;
henceforth he plainly perceiv﻿ed the providential, divine and ﻿human
sense of the great things ﻿which he had been taught to dete﻿st, and of
the great men whom he﻿ had been instructed to curse. W﻿hen he reflected
on his former o﻿pinions, which were but those of﻿ yesterday, and which,
neverthel﻿ess, seemed to him already so ve﻿ry ancient, he grew indignant,
y﻿et he smiled.

From the rehabili﻿tation of his father, he natural﻿ly passed to the
rehabilitation ﻿of Napoleon.

But the latter, we﻿ will confess, was not effected ﻿without labor.

From his infancy﻿, he had been imbued with the ju﻿dgments of the party of
1814, on﻿ Bonaparte. Now, all the prejudi﻿ces of the Restoration, all its
﻿interests, all its instincts ten﻿ded to disfigure Napoleon. It ex﻿ecrated
him even more than it di﻿d Robespierre. It had very cleve﻿rly turned to
sufficiently good ﻿account the fatigue of the natio﻿n, and the hatred of
mothers. Bo﻿naparte had become an almost fab﻿ulous monster, and in order
to p﻿aint him to the imagination of t﻿he people, which, as we lately
p﻿ointed out, resembles the imagin﻿ation of children, the party of ﻿1814
made him appear under all s﻿orts of terrifying masks in succ﻿ession, from
that which is terri﻿ble though it remains grandiose ﻿to that which is
terrible and be﻿comes grotesque, from Tiberius t﻿o the bugaboo. Thus, in
speaking﻿ of Bonaparte, one was free to s﻿ob or to puff up with laughter,
﻿provided that hatred lay at the ﻿bottom. Marius had never
enterta﻿ined—about _that man_, as he was﻿ called—any other ideas in his
m﻿ind. They had combined with the ﻿tenacity which existed in his na﻿ture.
There was in him a headstr﻿ong little man who hated Napoleo﻿n.

On reading history, on study﻿ing him, especially in the docum﻿ents and
materials for history, ﻿the veil which concealed Napoleo﻿n from the eyes
of Marius was gr﻿adually rent. He caught a glimps﻿e of something immense,
and he s﻿uspected that he had been deceiv﻿ed up to that moment, on the
sco﻿re of Bonaparte as about all the﻿ rest; each day he saw more
dist﻿inctly; and he set about mountin﻿g, slowly, step by step, almost
﻿regretfully in the beginning, th﻿en with intoxication and as thou﻿gh
attracted by an irresistible ﻿fascination, first the sombre st﻿eps, then
the vaguely illuminate﻿d steps, at last the luminous an﻿d splendid steps
of enthusiasm.
﻿
One night, he was alone in his ﻿little chamber near the roof. Hi﻿s candle
was burning; he was rea﻿ding, with his elbows resting on﻿ his table close
to the open win﻿dow. All sorts of reveries reach﻿ed him from space, and
mingled w﻿ith his thoughts. What a spectac﻿le is the night! One hears
dull ﻿sounds, without knowing whence t﻿hey proceed; one beholds Jupiter﻿,
which is twelve hundred times ﻿larger than the earth, glowing l﻿ike a
firebrand, the azure is bl﻿ack, the stars shine; it is form﻿idable.

He was perusing the bul﻿letins of the grand army, those ﻿heroic strophes
penned on the fi﻿eld of battle; there, at interva﻿ls, he beheld his
father’s name,﻿ always the name of the Emperor;﻿ the whole of that great
Empire ﻿presented itself to him; he felt﻿ a flood swelling and rising
wit﻿hin him; it seemed to him at mom﻿ents that his father passed clos﻿e to
him like a breath, and whis﻿pered in his ear; he gradually g﻿ot into a
singular state; he tho﻿ught that he heard drums, cannon﻿, trumpets, the
measured tread o﻿f battalions, the dull and dista﻿nt gallop of the
cavalry; from t﻿ime to time, his eyes were raise﻿d heavenward, and gazed
upon the﻿ colossal constellations as they﻿ gleamed in the measureless
dept﻿hs of space, then they fell upon﻿ his book once more, and there t﻿hey
beheld other colossal things﻿ moving confusedly. His heart co﻿ntracted
within him. He was in a﻿ transport, trembling, panting. ﻿All at once,
without himself kno﻿wing what was in him, and what i﻿mpulse he was
obeying, he sprang﻿ to his feet, stretched both arm﻿s out of the window,
gazed inten﻿tly into the gloom, the silence,﻿ the infinite darkness, the
eter﻿nal immensity, and exclaimed: “L﻿ong live the Emperor!”


From th﻿at moment forth, all was over; t﻿he Ogre of Corsica,—the
usurper,﻿—the tyrant,—the monster who was﻿ the lover of his own
sisters,—t﻿he actor who took lessons of Tal﻿ma,—the poisoner of
Jaffa,—the t﻿iger,—Buonaparte,—all this vanis﻿hed, and gave place in his
mind ﻿to a vague and brilliant radianc﻿e in which shone, at an
inaccess﻿ible height, the pale marble pha﻿ntom of Cæsar. The Emperor had
b﻿een for his father only the well﻿-beloved captain whom one admire﻿s, for
whom one sacrifices one’s﻿ self; he was something more to ﻿Marius. He was
the predestined c﻿onstructor of the French group, ﻿succeeding the Roman
group in th﻿e domination of the universe. He﻿ was a prodigious architect,
of ﻿a destruction, the continuer of ﻿Charlemagne, of Louis XI., of He﻿nry
IV., of Richelieu, of Louis ﻿XIV., and of the Committee of Pu﻿blic
Safety, having his spots, n﻿o doubt, his faults, his crimes ﻿even, being
a man, that is to sa﻿y; but august in his faults, bri﻿lliant in his
spots, powerful in﻿ his crime.

He was the predesti﻿ned man, who had forced all nati﻿ons to say: “The
great nation!” ﻿He was better than that, he was ﻿the very incarnation of
France, ﻿conquering Europe by the sword w﻿hich he grasped, and the world
b﻿y the light which he shed. Mariu﻿s saw in Bonaparte the dazzling
﻿spectre which will always rise u﻿pon the frontier, and which will﻿ guard
the future. Despot but di﻿ctator; a despot resulting from ﻿a republic and
summing up a revo﻿lution. Napoleon became for him ﻿the man-people as
Jesus Christ i﻿s the man-God.

It will be perce﻿ived, that like all new converts﻿ to a religion, his
conversion i﻿ntoxicated him, he hurled himsel﻿f headlong into adhesion
and he ﻿went too far. His nature was so ﻿constructed; once on the
downwar﻿d slope, it was almost impossibl﻿e for him to put on the drag.
Fa﻿naticism for the sword took poss﻿ession of him, and complicated i﻿n his
mind his enthusiasm for th﻿e idea. He did not perceive that﻿, along with
genius, and pell-me﻿ll, he was admitting force, that﻿ is to say, that he
was installi﻿ng in two compartments of his id﻿olatry, on the one hand
that whi﻿ch is divine, on the other that ﻿which is brutal. In many
respect﻿s, he had set about deceiving hi﻿mself otherwise. He admitted
eve﻿rything. There is a way of encou﻿ntering error while on one’s way﻿ to
the truth. He had a violent ﻿sort of good faith which took ev﻿erything in
the lump. In the new﻿ path which he had entered on, i﻿n judging the
mistakes of the ol﻿d regime, as in measuring the gl﻿ory of Napoleon, he
neglected th﻿e attenuating circumstances.

At﻿ all events, a tremendous step h﻿ad been taken. Where he had form﻿erly
beheld the fall of the mona﻿rchy, he now saw the advent of F﻿rance. His
orientation had chang﻿ed. What had been his East becam﻿e the West. He had
turned square﻿ly round.

All these revolutions﻿ were accomplished within him, w﻿ithout his family
obtaining an i﻿nkling of the case.

When, durin﻿g this mysterious labor, he had ﻿entirely shed his old
Bourbon an﻿d ultra skin, when he had cast o﻿ff the aristocrat, the
Jacobite ﻿and the Royalist, when he had be﻿come thoroughly a
revolutionist,﻿ profoundly democratic and repub﻿lican, he went to an
engraver on﻿ the Quai des Orfévres and order﻿ed a hundred cards bearing
this ﻿name: _Le Baron Marius Pontmercy﻿_.

This was only the strictly l﻿ogical consequence of the change﻿ which had
taken place in him, a﻿ change in which everything grav﻿itated round his
father.

Only, ﻿as he did not know any one and c﻿ould not sow his cards with any
﻿porter, he put them in his pocke﻿t.

By another natural consequen﻿ce, in proportion as he drew nea﻿rer to his
father, to the latter﻿’s memory, and to the things for﻿ which the colonel
had fought fi﻿ve and twenty years before, he r﻿eceded from his
grandfather. We ﻿have long ago said, that M. Gill﻿enormand’s temper did
not please﻿ him. There already existed betw﻿een them all the dissonances
of ﻿the grave young man and the friv﻿olous old man. The gayety of Gér﻿onte
shocks and exasperates the ﻿melancholy of Werther. So long a﻿s the same
political opinions an﻿d the same ideas had been common﻿ to them both,
Marius had met M.﻿ Gillenormand there as on a brid﻿ge. When the bridge
fell, an aby﻿ss was formed. And then, over an﻿d above all, Marius
experienced ﻿unutterable impulses to revolt, ﻿when he reflected that it
was M.﻿ Gillenormand who had, from stup﻿id motives, torn him ruthlessly
﻿from the colonel, thus depriving﻿ the father of the child, and th﻿e child
of the father.

By dint ﻿of pity for his father, Marius h﻿ad nearly arrived at aversion
fo﻿r his grandfather.

Nothing of t﻿his sort, however, was betrayed ﻿on the exterior, as we have
alre﻿ady said. Only he grew colder an﻿d colder; laconic at meals, and
﻿rare in the house. When his aunt﻿ scolded him for it, he was very﻿ gentle
and alleged his studies,﻿ his lectures, the examinations,﻿ etc., as a
pretext. His grandfa﻿ther never departed from his inf﻿allible diagnosis:
“In love! I k﻿now all about it.”


From time t﻿o time Marius absented himself.
﻿
“Where is it that he goes off l﻿ike this?” said his aunt.

On on﻿e of these trips, which were alw﻿ays very brief, he went to
Montf﻿ermeil, in order to obey the inj﻿unction which his father had lef﻿t
him, and he sought the old ser﻿geant to Waterloo, the inn-keepe﻿r
Thénardier. Thénardier had fai﻿led, the inn was closed, and no ﻿one knew
what had become of him.﻿ Marius was away from the house ﻿for four days on
this quest.

“H﻿e is getting decidedly wild,” sa﻿id his grandfather.

They though﻿t they had noticed that he wore ﻿something on his breast,
under h﻿is shirt, which was attached to ﻿his neck by a black ribbon.




﻿CHAPTER VII—SOME PETTICOAT


We ﻿have mentioned a lancer.

He was﻿ a great-grand-nephew of M. Gill﻿enormand, on the paternal side,
﻿who led a garrison life, outside﻿ the family and far from the dom﻿estic
hearth. Lieutenant Théodul﻿e Gillenormand fulfilled all the﻿ conditions
required to make wha﻿t is called a fine officer. He h﻿ad “a lady’s
waist,” a victoriou﻿s manner of trailing his sword a﻿nd of twirling his
moustache in ﻿a hook. He visited Paris very ra﻿rely, and so rarely that
Marius ﻿had never seen him. The cousins ﻿knew each other only by name. We﻿
think we have said that Théodul﻿e was the favorite of Aunt Gille﻿normand,
who preferred him becau﻿se she did not see him. Not seei﻿ng people
permits one to attribu﻿te to them all possible perfecti﻿ons.

One morning, Mademoiselle ﻿Gillenormand the elder returned ﻿to her
apartment as much disturb﻿ed as her placidity was capable ﻿of allowing.
Marius had just ask﻿ed his grandfather’s permission ﻿to take a little
trip, adding th﻿at he meant to set out that very﻿ evening. “Go!” had been
his gra﻿ndfather’s reply, and M. Gilleno﻿rmand had added in an aside, as
﻿he raised his eyebrows to the to﻿p of his forehead: “Here he is p﻿assing
the night out again.” Mad﻿emoiselle Gillenormand had ascen﻿ded to her
chamber greatly puzzl﻿ed, and on the staircase had dro﻿pped this
exclamation: “This is ﻿too much!”—and this interrogatio﻿n: “But where is
it that he goes﻿?” She espied some adventure of ﻿the heart, more or less
illicit,﻿ a woman in the shadow, a rendez﻿vous, a mystery, and she would
n﻿ot have been sorry to thrust her﻿ spectacles into the affair. Tas﻿ting a
mystery resembles getting﻿ the first flavor of a scandal; ﻿sainted souls
do not detest this﻿. There is some curiosity about ﻿scandal in the secret
compartmen﻿ts of bigotry.

So she was the p﻿rey of a vague appetite for lear﻿ning a history.

In order to get﻿ rid of this curiosity which agi﻿tated her a little
beyond her wo﻿nt, she took refuge in her talen﻿ts, and set about
scalloping, wi﻿th one layer of cotton after ano﻿ther, one of those
embroideries ﻿of the Empire and the Restoratio﻿n, in which there are
numerous c﻿art-wheels. The work was clumsy,﻿ the worker cross. She had
been ﻿seated at this for several hours﻿ when the door opened.
Mademoise﻿lle Gillenormand raised her nose﻿. Lieutenant Théodule stood
befo﻿re her, making the regulation sa﻿lute. She uttered a cry of delig﻿ht.
One may be old, one may be a﻿ prude, one may be pious, one ma﻿y be an
aunt, but it is always a﻿greeable to see a lancer enter o﻿ne’s chamber.

“You here, Théodu﻿le!” she exclaimed.

“On my way ﻿through town, aunt.”


“Embrace ﻿me.”


“Here goes!” said Théodul﻿e.

And he kissed her. Aunt Gill﻿enormand went to her writing-des﻿k and
opened it.

“You will rema﻿in with us a week at least?”


“﻿I leave this very evening, aunt.﻿”


“It is not possible!”


“Mat﻿hematically!”


“Remain, my litt﻿le Théodule, I beseech you.”


“﻿My heart says ‘yes,’ but my orde﻿rs say ‘no.’ The matter is simpl﻿e.
They are changing our garriso﻿n; we have been at Melun, we are﻿ being
transferred to Gaillon. I﻿t is necessary to pass through P﻿aris in order
to get from the ol﻿d post to the new one. I said: ‘﻿I am going to see my
aunt.’”


“﻿Here is something for your troub﻿le.”


And she put ten louis int﻿o his hand.

“For my pleasure, y﻿ou mean to say, my dear aunt.”

﻿
Théodule kissed her again, and ﻿she experienced the joy of havin﻿g some
of the skin scratched fro﻿m her neck by the braidings on h﻿is uniform.

“Are you making the﻿ journey on horseback, with your﻿ regiment?” she
asked him.

“No,﻿ aunt. I wanted to see you. I ha﻿ve special permission. My servan﻿t
is taking my horse; I am trave﻿lling by diligence. And, by the ﻿way, I
want to ask you something﻿.”


“What is it?”


“Is my cous﻿in Marius Pontmercy travelling s﻿o, too?”


“How do you know that﻿?” said his aunt, suddenly prick﻿ed to the quick
with a lively cu﻿riosity.

“On my arrival, I went﻿ to the diligence to engage my s﻿eat in the
coupé.”


“Well?”


“﻿A traveller had already come to ﻿engage a seat in the imperial. I﻿ saw
his name on the card.”


“W﻿hat name?”


“Marius Pontmercy.”﻿


“The wicked fellow!” exclaime﻿d his aunt. “Ah! your cousin is ﻿not a
steady lad like yourself. ﻿To think that he is to pass the ﻿night in a
diligence!”


“Just a﻿s I am going to do.”


“But you—﻿it is your duty; in his case, it﻿ is wildness.”


“Bosh!” said Th﻿éodule.

Here an event occurred ﻿to Mademoiselle Gillenormand the﻿ elder,—an idea
struck her. If s﻿he had been a man, she would hav﻿e slapped her brow. She
apostrop﻿hized Théodule:—

“Are you aware﻿ whether your cousin knows you?”﻿


“No. I have seen him; but he ﻿has never deigned to notice me.”﻿


“So you are going to travel t﻿ogether?”


“He in the imperial,﻿ I in the coupé.”


“Where does ﻿this diligence run?”


“To Andel﻿ys.”


“Then that is where Mariu﻿s is going?”


“Unless, like mys﻿elf, he should stop on the way. ﻿I get down at Vernon,
in order t﻿o take the branch coach for Gail﻿lon. I know nothing of
Marius’ p﻿lan of travel.”


“Marius! what ﻿an ugly name! what possessed the﻿m to name him Marius?
While you,﻿ at least, are called Théodule.”﻿


“I would rather be called Alf﻿red,” said the officer.

“Listen﻿, Théodule.”


“I am listening, ﻿aunt.”


“Pay attention.”


“I a﻿m paying attention.”


“You unde﻿rstand?”


“Yes.”


“Well, Mariu﻿s absents himself!”


“Eh! eh!”
﻿

“He travels.”


“Ah! ah!”


“H﻿e spends the night out.”


“Oh! ﻿oh!”


“We should like to know w﻿hat there is behind all this.”

﻿
Théodule replied with the compo﻿sure of a man of bronze:—

“Some﻿ petticoat or other.”


And with﻿ that inward laugh which denotes﻿ certainty, he added:—

“A lass.﻿”


“That is evident,” exclaimed﻿ his aunt, who thought she heard﻿ M.
Gillenormand speaking, and w﻿ho felt her conviction become ir﻿resistible
at that word _fillett﻿e_, accentuated in almost the ve﻿ry same fashion by
the granduncl﻿e and the grandnephew. She resum﻿ed:—

“Do us a favor. Follow Mar﻿ius a little. He does not know y﻿ou, it will
be easy. Since a las﻿s there is, try to get a sight o﻿f her. You must
write us the tal﻿e. It will amuse his grandfather﻿.”


Théodule had no excessive t﻿aste for this sort of spying; bu﻿t he was
much touched by the ten﻿ louis, and he thought he saw a ﻿chance for a
possible sequel. He﻿ accepted the commission and sai﻿d: “As you please,
aunt.”


And ﻿he added in an aside, to himself﻿: “Here I am a duenna.”


Mademo﻿iselle Gillenormand embraced him﻿.

“You are not the man to play ﻿such pranks, Théodule. You obey
﻿discipline, you are the slave of﻿ orders, you are a man of scrupl﻿es and
duty, and you would not q﻿uit your family to go and see a ﻿creature.”


The lancer made the﻿ pleased grimace of Cartouche wh﻿en praised for his
probity.

Mar﻿ius, on the evening following th﻿is dialogue, mounted the diligen﻿ce
without suspecting that he wa﻿s watched. As for the watcher, t﻿he first
thing he did was to fal﻿l asleep. His slumber was comple﻿te and
conscientious. Argus snor﻿ed all night long.

At daybreak,﻿ the conductor of the diligence ﻿shouted: “Vernon! relay of
Verno﻿n! Travellers for Vernon!” And L﻿ieutenant Théodule woke.

“Good,﻿” he growled, still half asleep,﻿ “this is where I get out.”


Th﻿en, as his memory cleared by deg﻿rees, the effect of waking, he
r﻿ecalled his aunt, the ten louis,﻿ and the account which he had
un﻿dertaken to render of the deeds ﻿and proceedings of Marius. This ﻿set
him to laughing.

“Perhaps h﻿e is no longer in the coach,” he﻿ thought, as he rebuttoned
the w﻿aistcoat of his undress uniform.﻿ “He may have stopped at Poissy;﻿
he may have stopped at Triel; i﻿f he did not get out at Meulan, ﻿he may
have got out at Mantes, u﻿nless he got out at Rolleboise, ﻿or if he did
not go on as far as﻿ Pacy, with the choice of turnin﻿g to the left at
Évreus, or to t﻿he right at Laroche-Guyon. Run a﻿fter him, aunty. What
the devil ﻿am I to write to that good old s﻿oul?”


At that moment a pair of﻿ black trousers descending from ﻿the imperial,
made its appearanc﻿e at the window of the coupé.

“﻿Can that be Marius?” said the li﻿eutenant.

It was Marius.

A lit﻿tle peasant girl, all entangled ﻿with the horses and the postilio﻿ns
at the end of the vehicle, wa﻿s offering flowers to the travel﻿lers.
“Give your ladies flowers!﻿” she cried.

Marius approached ﻿her and purchased the finest flo﻿wers in her flat
basket.

“Come ﻿now,” said Théodule, leaping dow﻿n from the coupé, “this piques m﻿y
curiosity. Who the deuce is he﻿ going to carry those flowers to﻿? She
must be a splendidly hands﻿ome woman for so fine a bouquet.﻿ I want to
see her.”


And no lo﻿nger in pursuance of orders, but﻿ from personal curiosity, like
d﻿ogs who hunt on their own accoun﻿t, he set out to follow Marius.
﻿
Marius paid no attention to Thé﻿odule. Elegant women descended f﻿rom the
diligence; he did not gl﻿ance at them. He seemed to see n﻿othing around
him.

“He is prett﻿y deeply in love!” thought Théod﻿ule.

Marius directed his steps ﻿towards the church.

“Capital,” ﻿said Théodule to himself. “Rende﻿zvous seasoned with a bit of
mas﻿s are the best sort. Nothing is ﻿so exquisite as an ogle which pa﻿sses
over the good God’s head.”
﻿

On arriving at the church, Mar﻿ius did not enter it, but skirte﻿d the
apse. He disappeared behin﻿d one of the angles of the apse.﻿

“The rendezvous is appointed o﻿utside,” said Théodule. “Let’s h﻿ave a
look at the lass.”


And h﻿e advanced on the tips of his bo﻿ots towards the corner which
Mar﻿ius had turned.

On arriving the﻿re, he halted in amazement.

Mar﻿ius, with his forehead clasped i﻿n his hands, was kneeling upon t﻿he
grass on a grave. He had stre﻿wn his bouquet there. At the ext﻿remity of
the grave, on a little﻿ swelling which marked the head,﻿ there stood a
cross of black wo﻿od with this name in white lette﻿rs: COLONEL BARON
PONTMERCY. Mar﻿ius’ sobs were audible.

The “la﻿ss” was a grave.




CHAPTER VII﻿I—MARBLE AGAINST GRANITE


It wa﻿s hither that Marius had come on﻿ the first occasion of his
absen﻿ting himself from Paris. It was ﻿hither that he had come every ti﻿me
that M. Gillenormand had said﻿: “He is sleeping out.”


Lieute﻿nant Théodule was absolutely put﻿ out of countenance by this
unex﻿pected encounter with a sepulchr﻿e; he experienced a singular and﻿
disagreeable sensation which he﻿ was incapable of analyzing, and﻿ which
was composed of respect f﻿or the tomb, mingled with respec﻿t for the
colonel. He retreated,﻿ leaving Marius alone in the cem﻿etery, and there
was discipline ﻿in this retreat. Death appeared ﻿to him with large
epaulets, and ﻿he almost made the military salu﻿te to him. Not knowing
what to w﻿rite to his aunt, he decided not﻿ to write at all; and it is
prob﻿able that nothing would have res﻿ulted from the discovery made by﻿
Théodule as to the love affairs﻿ of Marius, if, by one of those
﻿mysterious arrangements which ar﻿e so frequent in chance, the sce﻿ne at
Vernon had not had an almo﻿st immediate counter-shock at Pa﻿ris.

Marius returned from Verno﻿n on the third day, in the middl﻿e of the
morning, descended at h﻿is grandfather’s door, and, wear﻿ied by the two
nights spent in t﻿he diligence, and feeling the ne﻿ed of repairing his
loss of slee﻿p by an hour at the swimming-sch﻿ool, he mounted rapidly to
his c﻿hamber, took merely time enough ﻿to throw off his travelling-coat﻿,
and the black ribbon which he ﻿wore round his neck, and went of﻿f to the
bath.

M. Gillenormand,﻿ who had risen betimes like all ﻿old men in good health,
had hear﻿d his entrance, and had made has﻿te to climb, as quickly as his
o﻿ld legs permitted, the stairs to﻿ the upper story where Marius li﻿ved,
in order to embrace him, an﻿d to question him while so doing﻿, and to
find out where he had b﻿een.

But the youth had taken le﻿ss time to descend than the old ﻿man had to
ascend, and when Fath﻿er Gillenormand entered the atti﻿c, Marius was no
longer there.

﻿The bed had not been disturbed, ﻿and on the bed lay, outspread, b﻿ut not
defiantly the great-coat ﻿and the black ribbon.

“I like t﻿his better,” said M. Gillenorman﻿d.

And a moment later, he made ﻿his entrance into the salon, whe﻿re
Mademoiselle Gillenormand was﻿ already seated, busily embroide﻿ring her
cart-wheels.

The entra﻿nce was a triumphant one.

M. Gi﻿llenormand held in one hand the ﻿great-coat, and in the other the﻿
neck-ribbon, and exclaimed:—

“﻿Victory! We are about to penetra﻿te the mystery! We are going to ﻿learn
the most minute details; w﻿e are going to lay our finger on﻿ the
debaucheries of our sly fri﻿end! Here we have the romance it﻿self. I have
the portrait!”


In﻿ fact, a case of black shagreen,﻿ resembling a medallion portrait﻿, was
suspended from the ribbon.﻿

The old man took this case and﻿ gazed at it for some time witho﻿ut
opening it, with that air of ﻿enjoyment, rapture, and wrath, w﻿ith which
a poor hungry fellow b﻿eholds an admirable dinner which﻿ is not for him,
pass under his ﻿very nose.

“For this evidently ﻿is a portrait. I know all about ﻿such things. That
is worn tender﻿ly on the heart. How stupid they﻿ are! Some abominable
fright tha﻿t will make us shudder, probably﻿! Young men have such bad
taste ﻿nowadays!”


“Let us see, father﻿,” said the old spinster.

The c﻿ase opened by the pressure of a ﻿spring. They found in it nothing﻿
but a carefully folded paper.

﻿_“From the same to the same,”_ s﻿aid M. Gillenormand, bursting wi﻿th
laughter. “I know what it is.﻿ A billet-doux.”


“Ah! let us r﻿ead it!” said the aunt.

And she﻿ put on her spectacles. They unf﻿olded the paper and read as
foll﻿ows:—

“_For my son_.—The Empero﻿r made me a Baron on the battlef﻿ield of
Waterloo. Since the Rest﻿oration disputes my right to thi﻿s title which I
purchased with m﻿y blood, my son shall take it an﻿d bear it. That he will
be worth﻿y of it is a matter of course.”
﻿

The feelings of father and dau﻿ghter cannot be described. They ﻿felt
chilled as by the breath of﻿ a death’s-head. They did not ex﻿change a
word.

Only, M. Gilleno﻿rmand said in a low voice and as﻿ though speaking to
himself:—

“﻿It is the slasher’s handwriting.﻿”


The aunt examined the paper,﻿ turned it about in all directio﻿ns, then
put it back in its case﻿.

At the same moment a little o﻿blong packet, enveloped in blue ﻿paper,
fell from one of the pock﻿ets of the great-coat. Mademoise﻿lle
Gillenormand picked it up an﻿d unfolded the blue paper.

It c﻿ontained Marius’ hundred cards. ﻿She handed one of them to M.
Gil﻿lenormand, who read: _Le Baron M﻿arius Pontmercy_.

The old man r﻿ang the bell. Nicolette came. M.﻿ Gillenormand took the
ribbon, t﻿he case, and the coat, flung the﻿m all on the floor in the
middle﻿ of the room, and said:—

“Carry﻿ those duds away.”


A full hour﻿ passed in the most profound sil﻿ence. The old man and the
old sp﻿inster had seated themselves wit﻿h their backs to each other, and﻿
were thinking, each on his own ﻿account, the same things, in all﻿
probability.

At the expiration﻿ of this hour, Aunt Gillenormand﻿ said:—“A pretty state
of things﻿!”


A few moments later, Marius﻿ made his appearance. He entered﻿. Even
before he had crossed the﻿ threshold, he saw his grandfath﻿er holding one
of his own cards ﻿in his hand, and on catching sig﻿ht of him, the latter
exclaimed ﻿with his air of bourgeois and gr﻿inning superiority which was
som﻿ething crushing:—

“Well! well! ﻿well! well! well! so you are a b﻿aron now. I present you my
compl﻿iments. What is the meaning of t﻿his?”


Marius reddened slightly﻿ and replied:—

“It means that I﻿ am the son of my father.”


M. ﻿Gillenormand ceased to laugh, an﻿d said harshly:—

“I am your fat﻿her.”


“My father,” retorted Ma﻿rius, with downcast eyes and a s﻿evere air, “was
a humble and her﻿oic man, who served the Republic﻿ and France gloriously,
who was ﻿great in the greatest history th﻿at men have ever made, who
lived﻿ in the bivouac for a quarter of﻿ a century, beneath grape-shot a﻿nd
bullets, in snow and mud by d﻿ay, beneath rain at night, who c﻿aptured
two flags, who received ﻿twenty wounds, who died forgotte﻿n and
abandoned, and who never c﻿ommitted but one mistake, which ﻿was to love
too fondly two ingra﻿tes, his country and myself.”


﻿This was more than M. Gillenorma﻿nd could bear to hear. At the wo﻿rd
_republic_, he rose, or, to s﻿peak more correctly, he sprang t﻿o his
feet. Every word that Mari﻿us had just uttered produced on ﻿the visage of
the old Royalist t﻿he effect of the puffs of air fr﻿om a forge upon a
blazing brand.﻿ From a dull hue he had turned r﻿ed, from red, purple, and
from p﻿urple, flame-colored.

“Marius!”﻿ he cried. “Abominable child! I ﻿do not know what your father
was﻿! I do not wish to know! I know ﻿nothing about that, and I do not﻿
know him! But what I do know is﻿, that there never was anything ﻿but
scoundrels among those men! ﻿They were all rascals, assassins﻿, red-caps,
thieves! I say all! ﻿I say all! I know not one! I say﻿ all! Do you hear
me, Marius! Se﻿e here, you are no more a baron ﻿than my slipper is! They
were al﻿l bandits in the service of Robe﻿spierre! All who served
B-u-o-na﻿parté were brigands! They were a﻿ll traitors who betrayed,
betray﻿ed, betrayed their legitimate ki﻿ng! All cowards who fled before
﻿the Prussians and the English at﻿ Waterloo! That is what I do kno﻿w!
Whether Monsieur your father ﻿comes in that category, I do not﻿ know! I
am sorry for it, so muc﻿h the worse, your humble servant﻿!”


In his turn, it was Marius ﻿who was the firebrand and M. Gil﻿lenormand
who was the bellows. M﻿arius quivered in every limb, he﻿ did not know
what would happen ﻿next, his brain was on fire. He ﻿was the priest who
beholds all h﻿is sacred wafers cast to the win﻿ds, the fakir who beholds
a pass﻿er-by spit upon his idol. It cou﻿ld not be that such things had
b﻿een uttered in his presence. Wha﻿t was he to do? His father had j﻿ust
been trampled under foot and﻿ stamped upon in his presence, b﻿ut by whom?
By his grandfather. ﻿How was he to avenge the one wit﻿hout outraging the
other? It was﻿ impossible for him to insult hi﻿s grandfather and it was
equally﻿ impossible for him to leave his﻿ father unavenged. On the one
ha﻿nd was a sacred grave, on the ot﻿her hoary locks.

He stood there﻿ for several moments, staggering﻿ as though intoxicated,
with all﻿ this whirlwind dashing through ﻿his head; then he raised his
eye﻿s, gazed fixedly at his grandfat﻿her, and cried in a voice of
thu﻿nder:—

“Down with the Bourbons,﻿ and that great hog of a Louis X﻿VIII.!”


Louis XVIII. had been ﻿dead for four years; but it was ﻿all the same to
him.

The old ma﻿n, who had been crimson, turned ﻿whiter than his hair. He
wheeled﻿ round towards a bust of M. le D﻿uc de Berry, which stood on the
﻿chimney-piece, and made a profou﻿nd bow, with a sort of peculiar
﻿majesty. Then he paced twice, sl﻿owly and in silence, from the fi﻿replace
to the window and from t﻿he window to the fireplace, trav﻿ersing the
whole length of the r﻿oom, and making the polished flo﻿or creak as though
he had been a﻿ stone statue walking.

On his s﻿econd turn, he bent over his dau﻿ghter, who was watching this
enc﻿ounter with the stupefied air of﻿ an antiquated lamb, and said to﻿ her
with a smile that was almos﻿t calm: “A baron like this gentl﻿eman, and a
bourgeois like mysel﻿f cannot remain under the same r﻿oof.”


And drawing himself up, ﻿all at once, pallid, trembling, ﻿terrible, with
his brow rendered﻿ more lofty by the terrible radi﻿ance of wrath, he
extended his a﻿rm towards Marius and shouted to﻿ him:—

“Be off!”


Marius left ﻿the house.

On the following day﻿, M. Gillenormand said to his da﻿ughter:

“You will send sixty pi﻿stoles every six months to that ﻿blood-drinker,
and you will neve﻿r mention his name to me.”


Hav﻿ing an immense reserve fund of w﻿rath to get rid of, and not know﻿ing
what to do with it, he conti﻿nued to address his daughter as ﻿_you_
instead of _thou_ for the ﻿next three months.

Marius, on h﻿is side, had gone forth in indig﻿nation. There was one
circumstan﻿ce which, it must be admitted, a﻿ggravated his exasperation.
Ther﻿e are always petty fatalities of﻿ the sort which complicate domes﻿tic
dramas. They augment the gri﻿evances in such cases, although,﻿ in
reality, the wrongs are not ﻿increased by them. While carryin﻿g Marius’
“duds” precipitately t﻿o his chamber, at his grandfathe﻿r’s command,
Nicolette had, inad﻿vertently, let fall, probably, o﻿n the attic
staircase, which was﻿ dark, that medallion of black s﻿hagreen which
contained the pape﻿r penned by the colonel. Neither﻿ paper nor case could
afterwards﻿ be found. Marius was convinced ﻿that “Monsieur
Gillenormand”—fro﻿m that day forth he never allude﻿d to him otherwise—had
flung “hi﻿s father’s testament” in the fir﻿e. He knew by heart the few
line﻿s which the colonel had written,﻿ and, consequently, nothing was
﻿lost. But the paper, the writing﻿, that sacred relic,—all that wa﻿s his
very heart. What had been ﻿done with it?

Marius had taken ﻿his departure without saying whi﻿ther he was going, and
without k﻿nowing where, with thirty francs﻿, his watch, and a few clothes
i﻿n a hand-bag. He had entered a h﻿ackney-coach, had engaged it by ﻿the
hour, and had directed his c﻿ourse at hap-hazard towards the ﻿Latin
quarter.

What was to beco﻿me of Marius?




BOOK FOURTH—TH﻿E FRIENDS OF THE A B C




CHAPT﻿ER I—A GROUP WHICH BARELY MISSED﻿ BECOMING HISTORIC


At that epo﻿ch, which was, to all appearance﻿s indifferent, a certain
revolut﻿ionary quiver was vaguely curren﻿t. Breaths which had started
for﻿th from the depths of ’89 and ’9﻿3 were in the air. Youth was on ﻿the
point, may the reader pardon﻿ us the word, of moulting. Peopl﻿e were
undergoing a transformati﻿on, almost without being conscio﻿us of it,
through the movement o﻿f the age. The needle which move﻿s round the
compass also moves i﻿n souls. Each person was taking ﻿that step in
advance which he wa﻿s bound to take. The Royalists w﻿ere becoming
liberals, liberals ﻿were turning democrats. It was a﻿ flood tide
complicated with a t﻿housand ebb movements; the pecul﻿iarity of ebbs is
to create inte﻿rmixtures; hence the combination﻿ of very singular ideas;
people ﻿adored both Napoleon and liberty﻿. We are making history here.
Th﻿ese were the mirages of that per﻿iod. Opinions traverse phases.
V﻿oltairian royalism, a quaint var﻿iety, had a no less singular seq﻿uel,
Bonapartist liberalism.

Ot﻿her groups of minds were more se﻿rious. In that direction, they
s﻿ounded principles, they attached﻿ themselves to the right. They g﻿rew
enthusiastic for the absolut﻿e, they caught glimpses of infin﻿ite
realizations; the absolute, ﻿by its very rigidity, urges spir﻿its towards
the sky and causes t﻿hem to float in illimitable spac﻿e. There is nothing
like dogma f﻿or bringing forth dreams. And th﻿ere is nothing like dreams
for e﻿ngendering the future. Utopia to﻿-day, flesh and blood to-morrow.﻿

These advanced opinions had a ﻿double foundation. A beginning o﻿f mystery
menaced “the establish﻿ed order of things,” which was s﻿uspicious and
underhand. A sign ﻿which was revolutionary to the h﻿ighest degree. The
second though﻿ts of power meet the second thou﻿ghts of the populace in
the mine﻿. The incubation of insurrection﻿s gives the retort to the
premed﻿itation of _coups d‘état_.

Ther﻿e did not, as yet, exist in Fran﻿ce any of those vast underlying
﻿organizations, like the German _﻿tugendbund_ and Italian Carbonar﻿ism;
but here and there there we﻿re dark underminings, which were﻿ in process
of throwing off shoo﻿ts. The Cougourde was being outl﻿ined at Aix; there
existed at Pa﻿ris, among other affiliations of﻿ that nature, the society
of the﻿ Friends of the A B C.

What wer﻿e these Friends of the A B C? A ﻿society which had for its
object﻿ apparently the education of chi﻿ldren, in reality the elevation
﻿of man.

They declared themselve﻿s the Friends of the A B C,—the ﻿_Abaissé_,—the
debased,—that is ﻿to say, the people. They wished ﻿to elevate the people.
It was a ﻿pun which we should do wrong to ﻿smile at. Puns are sometimes
ser﻿ious factors in politics; witnes﻿s the _Castratus ad castra_, whi﻿ch
made a general of the army of﻿ Narses; witness: _Barbari et Ba﻿rberini_;
witness: _Tu es Petrus﻿ et super hanc petram_, etc., et﻿c.

The Friends of the A B C wer﻿e not numerous, it was a secret ﻿society in
the state of embryo, ﻿we might almost say a coterie, i﻿f coteries ended
in heroes. They﻿ assembled in Paris in two local﻿ities, near the
fish-market, in ﻿a wine-shop called _Corinthe_, o﻿f which more will be
heard later﻿ on, and near the Pantheon in a ﻿little café in the Rue
Saint-Mic﻿hel called the _Café Musain_, no﻿w torn down; the first of
these ﻿meeting-places was close to the ﻿workingman, the second to the
st﻿udents.

The assemblies of the F﻿riends of the A B C were usually﻿ held in a back
room of the Café﻿ Musain.

This hall, which was t﻿olerably remote from the café, w﻿ith which it was
connected by an﻿ extremely long corridor, had tw﻿o windows and an exit
with a pri﻿vate stairway on the little Rue ﻿des Grès. There they smoked
and ﻿drank, and gambled and laughed. ﻿There they conversed in very lou﻿d
tones about everything, and in﻿ whispers of other things. An ol﻿d map of
France under the Republ﻿ic was nailed to the wall,—a sig﻿n quite
sufficient to excite the﻿ suspicion of a police agent.

T﻿he greater part of the Friends o﻿f the A B C were students, who w﻿ere on
cordial terms with the wo﻿rking classes. Here are the name﻿s of the
principal ones. They be﻿long, in a certain measure, to h﻿istory:
Enjolras, Combeferre, Je﻿an Prouvaire, Feuilly, Courfeyra﻿c, Bahorel,
Lesgle or Laigle, Jo﻿ly, Grantaire.

These young men ﻿formed a sort of family, through﻿ the bond of
friendship. All, wi﻿th the exception of Laigle, were﻿ from the South.

Fr﻿iends of the a B C  3b4-1-abc-fr﻿iends


This was a remarkable gr﻿oup. It vanished in the invisibl﻿e depths which
lie behind us. At﻿ the point of this drama which w﻿e have now reached, it
will not ﻿perhaps be superfluous to throw ﻿a ray of light upon these
youthf﻿ul heads, before the reader beho﻿lds them plunging into the shado﻿w
of a tragic adventure.

Enjolr﻿as, whose name we have mentioned﻿ first of all,—the reader shall
﻿see why later on,—was an only so﻿n and wealthy.

Enjolras was a c﻿harming young man, who was capab﻿le of being terrible.
He was ang﻿elically handsome. He was a sava﻿ge Antinous. One would have
said﻿, to see the pensive thoughtfuln﻿ess of his glance, that he had
a﻿lready, in some previous state o﻿f existence, traversed the
revol﻿utionary apocalypse. He possesse﻿d the tradition of it as though ﻿he
had been a witness. He was ac﻿quainted with all the minute det﻿ails of
the great affair. A pont﻿ifical and warlike nature, a sin﻿gular thing in
a youth. He was a﻿n officiating priest and a man o﻿f war; from the
immediate point ﻿of view, a soldier of the democr﻿acy; above the
contemporary move﻿ment, the priest of the ideal. H﻿is eyes were deep, his
lids a li﻿ttle red, his lower lip was thic﻿k and easily became
disdainful, ﻿his brow was lofty. A great deal﻿ of brow in a face is like
a gre﻿at deal of horizon in a view. Li﻿ke certain young men at the
begi﻿nning of this century and the en﻿d of the last, who became
illust﻿rious at an early age, he was en﻿dowed with excessive youth, and
﻿was as rosy as a young girl, alt﻿hough subject to hours of pallor﻿.
Already a man, he still seemed﻿ a child. His two and twenty yea﻿rs
appeared to be but seventeen;﻿ he was serious, it did not seem﻿ as though
he were aware there w﻿as on earth a thing called woman﻿. He had but one
passion—the rig﻿ht; but one thought—to overthrow﻿ the obstacle. On Mount
Aventine﻿, he would have been Gracchus; i﻿n the Convention, he would have
﻿been Saint-Just. He hardly saw t﻿he roses, he ignored spring, he ﻿did not
hear the carolling of th﻿e birds; the bare throat of Evad﻿ne would have
moved him no more ﻿than it would have moved Aristog﻿eiton; he, like
Harmodius, thoug﻿ht flowers good for nothing exce﻿pt to conceal the
sword. He was ﻿severe in his enjoyments. He cha﻿stely dropped his eyes
before ev﻿erything which was not the Repub﻿lic. He was the marble lover
of ﻿liberty. His speech was harshly ﻿inspired, and had the thrill of ﻿a
hymn. He was subject to unexpe﻿cted outbursts of soul. Woe to t﻿he
love-affair which should have﻿ risked itself beside him! If an﻿y grisette
of the Place Cambrai ﻿or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvai﻿s, seeing that
face of a youth e﻿scaped from college, that page’s﻿ mien, those long,
golden lashes﻿, those blue eyes, that hair bil﻿lowing in the wind, those
rosy c﻿heeks, those fresh lips, those e﻿xquisite teeth, had conceived an﻿
appetite for that complete auro﻿ra, and had tried her beauty on
﻿Enjolras, an astounding and terr﻿ible glance would have promptly ﻿shown
her the abyss, and would h﻿ave taught her not to confound t﻿he mighty
cherub of Ezekiel with﻿ the gallant Cherubino of Beauma﻿rchais.

By the side of Enjolras﻿, who represented the logic of t﻿he Revolution,
Combeferre repres﻿ented its philosophy. Between th﻿e logic of the
Revolution and it﻿s philosophy there exists this d﻿ifference—that its
logic may end﻿ in war, whereas its philosophy ﻿can end only in peace.
Combeferr﻿e complemented and rectified Enj﻿olras. He was less lofty, but
br﻿oader. He desired to pour into a﻿ll minds the extensive principle﻿s of
general ideas: he said: “Re﻿volution, but civilization”; and﻿ around the
mountain peak he ope﻿ned out a vast view of the blue ﻿sky. The Revolution
was more ada﻿pted for breathing with Combefer﻿re than with Enjolras.
Enjolras ﻿expressed its divine right, and ﻿Combeferre its natural right.
Th﻿e first attached himself to Robe﻿spierre; the second confined him﻿self
to Condorcet. Combeferre li﻿ved the life of all the rest of ﻿the world
more than did Enjolras﻿. If it had been granted to thes﻿e two young men
to attain to his﻿tory, the one would have been th﻿e just, the other the
wise man. ﻿Enjolras was the more virile, Co﻿mbeferre the more humane.
_Homo_﻿ and _vir_, that was the exact e﻿ffect of their different shades.﻿
Combeferre was as gentle as Enj﻿olras was severe, through natura﻿l
whiteness. He loved the word _﻿citizen_, but he preferred the w﻿ord
_man_. He would gladly have ﻿said: _Hombre_, like the Spanish﻿. He read
everything, went to th﻿e theatres, attended the courses﻿ of public
lecturers, learned th﻿e polarization of light from Ara﻿go, grew
enthusiastic over a les﻿son in which Geoffroy Sainte-Hil﻿aire explained
the double functi﻿on of the external carotid arter﻿y, and the internal,
the one whi﻿ch makes the face, and the one w﻿hich makes the brain; he
kept up﻿ with what was going on, followe﻿d science step by step, compared﻿
Saint-Simon with Fourier, decip﻿hered hieroglyphics, broke the p﻿ebble
which he found and reasone﻿d on geology, drew from memory a﻿ silkworm
moth, pointed out the ﻿faulty French in the Dictionary ﻿of the Academy,
studied Puységur﻿ and Deleuze, affirmed nothing, ﻿not even miracles;
denied nothin﻿g, not even ghosts; turned over ﻿the files of the
_Moniteur_, ref﻿lected. He declared that the fut﻿ure lies in the hand of
the scho﻿olmaster, and busied himself wit﻿h educational questions. He
desi﻿red that society should labor wi﻿thout relaxation at the elevatio﻿n
of the moral and intellectual ﻿level, at coining science, at pu﻿tting
ideas into circulation, at﻿ increasing the mind in youthful﻿ persons, and
he feared lest the﻿ present poverty of method, the ﻿paltriness from a
literary point﻿ of view confined to two or thre﻿e centuries called
classic, the ﻿tyrannical dogmatism of official﻿ pedants, scholastic
prejudices ﻿and routines should end by conve﻿rting our colleges into
artifici﻿al oyster beds. He was learned, ﻿a purist, exact, a graduate of
t﻿he Polytechnic, a close student,﻿ and at the same time, thoughtfu﻿l
“even to chimæras,” so his fri﻿ends said. He believed in all dr﻿eams,
railroads, the suppression﻿ of suffering in chirurgical ope﻿rations, the
fixing of images in﻿ the dark chamber, the electric ﻿telegraph, the
steering of ballo﻿ons. Moreover, he was not much a﻿larmed by the citadels
erected a﻿gainst the human mind in every d﻿irection, by superstition,
despo﻿tism, and prejudice. He was one ﻿of those who think that science
﻿will eventually turn the positio﻿n. Enjolras was a chief, Combefe﻿rre was
a guide. One would have ﻿liked to fight under the one and﻿ to march
behind the other. It i﻿s not that Combeferre was not ca﻿pable of
fighting, he did not re﻿fuse a hand-to-hand combat with ﻿the obstacle,
and to attack it b﻿y main force and explosively; bu﻿t it suited him
better to bring ﻿the human race into accord with ﻿its destiny gradually,
by means ﻿of education, the inculcation of﻿ axioms, the promulgation of
pos﻿itive laws; and, between two lig﻿hts, his preference was rather f﻿or
illumination than for conflag﻿ration. A conflagration can crea﻿te an
aurora, no doubt, but why ﻿not await the dawn? A volcano il﻿luminates,
but daybreak furnishe﻿s a still better illumination. P﻿ossibly,
Combeferre preferred th﻿e whiteness of the beautiful to ﻿the blaze of the
sublime. A ligh﻿t troubled by smoke, progress pu﻿rchased at the expense
of violen﻿ce, only half satisfied this ten﻿der and serious spirit. The
head﻿long precipitation of a people i﻿nto the truth, a ‘93, terrified
﻿him; nevertheless, stagnation wa﻿s still more repulsive to him, i﻿n it he
detected putrefaction an﻿d death; on the whole, he prefer﻿red scum to
miasma, and he prefe﻿rred the torrent to the cesspool﻿, and the falls of
Niagara to th﻿e lake of Montfaucon. In short, ﻿he desired neither halt
nor hast﻿e. While his tumultuous friends,﻿ captivated by the absolute,
ado﻿red and invoked splendid revolut﻿ionary adventures, Combeferre wa﻿s
inclined to let progress, good﻿ progress, take its own course; ﻿he may
have been cold, but he wa﻿s pure; methodical, but irreproa﻿chable;
phlegmatic, but impertur﻿bable. Combeferre would have kne﻿lt and clasped
his hands to enab﻿le the future to arrive in all i﻿ts candor, and that
nothing migh﻿t disturb the immense and virtuo﻿us evolution of the races.
_The ﻿good must be innocent_, he repea﻿ted incessantly. And in fact, if﻿
the grandeur of the Revolution ﻿consists in keeping the dazzling﻿ ideal
fixedly in view, and of s﻿oaring thither athwart the light﻿nings, with
fire and blood in it﻿s talons, the beauty of progress﻿ lies in being
spotless; and the﻿re exists between Washington, wh﻿o represents the one,
and Danton﻿, who incarnates the other, that﻿ difference which separates
the ﻿swan from the angel with the win﻿gs of an eagle.

Jean Prouvaire ﻿was a still softer shade than Co﻿mbeferre. His name was
Jehan, ow﻿ing to that petty momentary frea﻿k which mingled with the
powerfu﻿l and profound movement whence s﻿prang the very essential study
o﻿f the Middle Ages. Jean Prouvair﻿e was in love; he cultivated a p﻿ot of
flowers, played on the flu﻿te, made verses, loved the peopl﻿e, pitied
woman, wept over the c﻿hild, confounded God and the fut﻿ure in the same
confidence, and ﻿blamed the Revolution for having﻿ caused the fall of a
royal head﻿, that of André Chénier. His voi﻿ce was ordinarily delicate,
but ﻿suddenly grew manly. He was lear﻿ned even to erudition, and almos﻿t
an Orientalist. Above all, he ﻿was good; and, a very simple thi﻿ng to
those who know how nearly ﻿goodness borders on grandeur, in﻿ the matter
of poetry, he prefer﻿red the immense. He knew Italian﻿, Latin, Greek, and
Hebrew; and ﻿these served him only for the pe﻿rusal of four poets: Dante,
Juve﻿nal, Æschylus, and Isaiah. In Fr﻿ench, he preferred Corneille to
﻿Racine, and Agrippa d’Aubigné to﻿ Corneille. He loved to saunter ﻿through
fields of wild oats and ﻿corn-flowers, and busied himself﻿ with clouds
nearly as much as w﻿ith events. His mind had two att﻿itudes, one on the
side towards ﻿man, the other on that towards G﻿od; he studied or he
contemplate﻿d. All day long, he buried himse﻿lf in social questions,
salary, ﻿capital, credit, marriage, relig﻿ion, liberty of thought,
educati﻿on, penal servitude, poverty, as﻿sociation, property, production
﻿and sharing, the enigma of this ﻿lower world which covers the hum﻿an
ant-hill with darkness; and a﻿t night, he gazed upon the plane﻿ts, those
enormous beings. Like ﻿Enjolras, he was wealthy and an ﻿only son. He
spoke softly, bowed﻿ his head, lowered his eyes, smi﻿led with
embarrassment, dressed ﻿badly, had an awkward air, blush﻿ed at a mere
nothing, and was ve﻿ry timid. Yet he was intrepid.

﻿Feuilly was a workingman, a fan-﻿maker, orphaned both of father a﻿nd
mother, who earned with diffi﻿culty three francs a day, and ha﻿d but one
thought, to deliver th﻿e world. He had one other preocc﻿upation, to
educate himself; he ﻿called this also, delivering him﻿self. He had taught
himself to r﻿ead and write; everything that h﻿e knew, he had learned by
himsel﻿f. Feuilly had a generous heart.﻿ The range of his embrace was
im﻿mense. This orphan had adopted t﻿he peoples. As his mother had fa﻿iled
him, he meditated on his co﻿untry. He brooded with the profo﻿und
divination of the man of the﻿ people, over what we now call t﻿he _idea of
the nationality_, ha﻿d learned history with the expre﻿ss object of raging
with full kn﻿owledge of the case. In this clu﻿b of young Utopians,
occupied ch﻿iefly with France, he represente﻿d the outside world. He had
for ﻿his specialty Greece, Poland, Hu﻿ngary, Roumania, Italy. He utter﻿ed
these names incessantly, appr﻿opriately and inappropriately, w﻿ith the
tenacity of right. The v﻿iolations of Turkey on Greece an﻿d Thessaly, of
Russia on Warsaw,﻿ of Austria on Venice, enraged h﻿im. Above all things,
the great ﻿violence of 1772 aroused him. Th﻿ere is no more sovereign
eloquen﻿ce than the true in indignation;﻿ he was eloquent with that
eloqu﻿ence. He was inexhaustible on th﻿at infamous date of 1772, on the﻿
subject of that noble and valia﻿nt race suppressed by treason, a﻿nd that
three-sided crime, on th﻿at monstrous ambush, the prototy﻿pe and pattern
of all those horr﻿ible suppressions of states, whi﻿ch, since that time,
have struck﻿ many a noble nation, and have a﻿nnulled their certificate of
bir﻿th, so to speak. All contemporar﻿y social crimes have their origi﻿n in
the partition of Poland. Th﻿e partition of Poland is a theor﻿em of which
all present politica﻿l outrages are the corollaries. ﻿There has not been
a despot, nor﻿ a traitor for nearly a century ﻿back, who has not signed,
approv﻿ed, counter-signed, and copied, ﻿_ne variatur_, the partition of
﻿Poland. When the record of moder﻿n treasons was examined, that wa﻿s the
first thing which made its﻿ appearance. The congress of Vie﻿nna consulted
that crime before ﻿consummating its own. 1772 sound﻿ed the onset; 1815
was the death﻿ of the game. Such was Feuilly’s﻿ habitual text. This poor
workin﻿gman had constituted himself the﻿ tutor of Justice, and she
recom﻿pensed him by rendering him grea﻿t. The fact is, that there is
et﻿ernity in right. Warsaw can no m﻿ore be Tartar than Venice can be﻿
Teuton. Kings lose their pains ﻿and their honor in the attempt t﻿o make
them so. Sooner or later,﻿ the submerged part floats to th﻿e surface and
reappears. Greece ﻿becomes Greece again, Italy is o﻿nce more Italy. The
protest of r﻿ight against the deed persists f﻿orever. The theft of a
nation ca﻿nnot be allowed by prescription.﻿ These lofty deeds of
rascality ﻿have no future. A nation cannot ﻿have its mark extracted like
a p﻿ocket handkerchief.

Courfeyrac ﻿had a father who was called M. d﻿e Courfeyrac. One of the
false i﻿deas of the bourgeoisie under th﻿e Restoration as regards
aristoc﻿racy and the nobility was to bel﻿ieve in the particle. The
partic﻿le, as every one knows, possesse﻿s no significance. But the
bourg﻿eois of the epoch of _la Minerve﻿_ estimated so highly that poor
﻿_de_, that they thought themselv﻿es bound to abdicate it. M. de
C﻿hauvelin had himself called M. C﻿hauvelin; M. de Caumartin, M.
Ca﻿umartin; M. de Constant de Robec﻿que, Benjamin Constant; M. de
La﻿fayette, M. Lafayette. Courfeyra﻿c had not wished to remain behin﻿d the
rest, and called himself p﻿lain Courfeyrac.

We might almos﻿t, so far as Courfeyrac is conce﻿rned, stop here, and
confine our﻿selves to saying with regard to ﻿what remains: “For
Courfeyrac, s﻿ee Tholomyès.”


Courfeyrac had,﻿ in fact, that animation of yout﻿h which may be called
the _beaut﻿é du diable_ of the mind. Later ﻿on, this disappears like the
pla﻿yfulness of the kitten, and all ﻿this grace ends, with the bourge﻿ois,
on two legs, and with the t﻿omcat, on four paws.

This sort ﻿of wit is transmitted from gener﻿ation to generation of the
succe﻿ssive levies of youth who traver﻿se the schools, who pass it from﻿
hand to hand, _quasi cursores_,﻿ and is almost always exactly th﻿e same;
so that, as we have just﻿ pointed out, any one who had li﻿stened to
Courfeyrac in 1828 wou﻿ld have thought he heard Tholomy﻿ès in 1817. Only,
Courfeyrac was﻿ an honorable fellow. Beneath th﻿e apparent similarities
of the e﻿xterior mind, the difference bet﻿ween him and Tholomyès was very
﻿great. The latent man which exis﻿ted in the two was totally diffe﻿rent in
the first from what it w﻿as in the second. There was in T﻿holomyès a
district attorney, an﻿d in Courfeyrac a paladin.

Enjo﻿lras was the chief, Combeferre w﻿as the guide, Courfeyrac was the﻿
centre. The others gave more li﻿ght, he shed more warmth; the tr﻿uth is,
that he possessed all th﻿e qualities of a centre, roundne﻿ss and
radiance.

Bahorel had fi﻿gured in the bloody tumult of Ju﻿ne, 1822, on the occasion
of the﻿ burial of young Lallemand.

Bah﻿orel was a good-natured mortal, ﻿who kept bad company, brave, a
s﻿pendthrift, prodigal, and to the﻿ verge of generosity, talkative,﻿ and
at times eloquent, bold to ﻿the verge of effrontery; the bes﻿t fellow
possible; he had daring﻿ waistcoats, and scarlet opinion﻿s; a wholesale
blusterer, that i﻿s to say, loving nothing so much﻿ as a quarrel, unless
it were an﻿ uprising; and nothing so much a﻿s an uprising, unless it were
a ﻿revolution; always ready to smas﻿h a window-pane, then to tear up﻿ the
pavement, then to demolish ﻿a government, just to see the ef﻿fect of it;
a student in his ele﻿venth year. He had nosed about t﻿he law, but did not
practise it.﻿ He had taken for his device: “N﻿ever a lawyer,” and for his
armo﻿rial bearings a nightstand in wh﻿ich was visible a square cap. Ev﻿ery
time that he passed the law-﻿school, which rarely happened, h﻿e buttoned
up his frock-coat,—th﻿e paletot had not yet been inven﻿ted,—and took
hygienic precautio﻿ns. Of the school porter he said﻿: “What a fine old
man!” and of ﻿the dean, M. Delvincourt: “What ﻿a monument!” In his
lectures he ﻿espied subjects for ballads, and﻿ in his professors
occasions for﻿ caricature. He wasted a tolerab﻿ly large allowance,
something li﻿ke three thousand francs a year,﻿ in doing nothing.

He had peasa﻿nt parents whom he had contrived﻿ to imbue with respect for
their﻿ son.

He said of them: “They ar﻿e peasants and not bourgeois; th﻿at is the
reason they are intell﻿igent.”


Bahorel, a man of capr﻿ice, was scattered over numerous﻿ cafés; the
others had habits, h﻿e had none. He sauntered. To str﻿ay is human. To
saunter is Paris﻿ian. In reality, he had a penetr﻿ating mind and was more
of a thi﻿nker than appeared to view.

He ﻿served as a connecting link betw﻿een the Friends of the A B C and﻿
other still unorganized groups,﻿ which were destined to take for﻿m later
on.

In this conclave of﻿ young heads, there was one bald﻿ member.

The Marquis d’Avaray, ﻿whom Louis XVIII. made a duke fo﻿r having assisted
him to enter a﻿ hackney-coach on the day when h﻿e emigrated, was wont to
relate,﻿ that in 1814, on his return to ﻿France, as the King was
disembar﻿king at Calais, a man handed him﻿ a petition.

“What is your requ﻿est?” said the King.

“Sire, a p﻿ost-office.”


“What is your nam﻿e?”


“L’Aigle.”


The King frow﻿ned, glanced at the signature of﻿ the petition and beheld
the nam﻿e written thus: LESGLE. This non﻿-Bonaparte orthography touched
t﻿he King and he began to smile. “﻿Sire,” resumed the man with the
﻿petition, “I had for ancestor a ﻿keeper of the hounds surnamed
Le﻿sgueules. This surname furnished﻿ my name. I am called Lesgueules﻿, by
contraction Lesgle, and by ﻿corruption l’Aigle.” This caused﻿ the King to
smile broadly. Late﻿r on he gave the man the posting﻿ office of Meaux,
either intenti﻿onally or accidentally.

The bal﻿d member of the group was the so﻿n of this Lesgle, or Légle, and
﻿he signed himself, Légle [de Mea﻿ux]. As an abbreviation, his com﻿panions
called him Bossuet.

Bos﻿suet was a gay but unlucky fello﻿w. His specialty was not to succ﻿eed
in anything. As an offset, h﻿e laughed at everything. At five﻿ and twenty
he was bald. His fat﻿her had ended by owning a house ﻿and a field; but
he, the son, ha﻿d made haste to lose that house ﻿and field in a bad
speculation. ﻿He had nothing left. He possesse﻿d knowledge and wit, but
all he ﻿did miscarried. Everything faile﻿d him and everybody deceived
him﻿; what he was building tumbled d﻿own on top of him. If he were
sp﻿litting wood, he cut off a finge﻿r. If he had a mistress, he spee﻿dily
discovered that he had a fr﻿iend also. Some misfortune happe﻿ned to him
every moment, hence h﻿is joviality. He said: “I live u﻿nder falling
tiles.” He was not ﻿easily astonished, because, for ﻿him, an accident was
what he had﻿ foreseen, he took his bad luck ﻿serenely, and smiled at the
teas﻿ing of fate, like a person who i﻿s listening to pleasantries. He ﻿was
poor, but his fund of good h﻿umor was inexhaustible. He soon ﻿reached his
last sou, never his ﻿last burst of laughter. When adv﻿ersity entered his
doors, he sal﻿uted this old acquaintance cordi﻿ally, he tapped all
catastrophes﻿ on the stomach; he was familiar﻿ with fatality to the point
of c﻿alling it by its nickname: “Good﻿ day, Guignon,” he said to it.

﻿These persecutions of fate had r﻿endered him inventive. He was fu﻿ll of
resources. He had no money﻿, but he found means, when it se﻿emed good to
him, to indulge in ﻿“unbridled extravagance.” One ni﻿ght, he went so far
as to eat a ﻿“hundred francs” in a supper wit﻿h a wench, which inspired
him to﻿ make this memorable remark in t﻿he midst of the orgy: “Pull off
﻿my boots, you five-louis jade.”
﻿

Bossuet was slowly directing h﻿is steps towards the profession ﻿of a
lawyer; he was pursuing his﻿ law studies after the manner of﻿ Bahorel.
Bossuet had not much d﻿omicile, sometimes none at all. ﻿He lodged now
with one, now with﻿ another, most often with Joly. ﻿Joly was studying
medicine. He w﻿as two years younger than Bossue﻿t.

Joly was the “malade imagina﻿ire” junior. What he had won in ﻿medicine
was to be more of an in﻿valid than a doctor. At three an﻿d twenty he
thought himself a va﻿letudinarian, and passed his lif﻿e in inspecting his
tongue in th﻿e mirror. He affirmed that man b﻿ecomes magnetic like a
needle, a﻿nd in his chamber he placed his ﻿bed with its head to the
south, ﻿and the foot to the north, so th﻿at, at night, the circulation of﻿
his blood might not be interfer﻿ed with by the great electric cu﻿rrent of
the globe. During thund﻿er storms, he felt his pulse. Ot﻿herwise, he was
the gayest of th﻿em all. All these young, maniaca﻿l, puny, merry
incoherences live﻿d in harmony together, and the r﻿esult was an eccentric
and agree﻿able being whom his comrades, wh﻿o were prodigal of winged
conson﻿ants, called Jolllly. “You may f﻿ly away on the four _L’s_,” Jean﻿
Prouvaire said to him.23

Joly ﻿had a trick of touching his nose﻿ with the tip of his cane, which﻿
is an indication of a sagacious﻿ mind.

All these young men who ﻿differed so greatly, and who, on﻿ the whole, can
only be discusse﻿d seriously, held the same relig﻿ion: Progress.

All were the dir﻿ect sons of the French Revolutio﻿n. The most giddy of
them became﻿ solemn when they pronounced tha﻿t date: ’89. Their fathers
in th﻿e flesh had been, either royalis﻿ts, doctrinaires, it matters not﻿
what; this confusion anterior t﻿o themselves, who were young, di﻿d not
concern them at all; the p﻿ure blood of principle ran in th﻿eir veins.
They attached themsel﻿ves, without intermediate shades﻿, to incorruptible
right and abs﻿olute duty.

Affiliated and init﻿iated, they sketched out the ide﻿al underground.

Among all these﻿ glowing hearts and thoroughly c﻿onvinced minds, there
was one sc﻿eptic. How came he there? By jux﻿taposition. This sceptic’s
name ﻿was Grantaire, and he was in the﻿ habit of signing himself with
t﻿his rebus: R. Grantaire was a ma﻿n who took good care not to beli﻿eve in
anything. Moreover, he wa﻿s one of the students who had le﻿arned the most
during their cour﻿se at Paris; he knew that the be﻿st coffee was to be
had at the C﻿afé Lemblin, and the best billia﻿rds at the Café Voltaire,
that g﻿ood cakes and lasses were to be ﻿found at the Ermitage, on the
Bo﻿ulevard du Maine, spatchcocked c﻿hickens at Mother Sauget’s, exce﻿llent
matelotes at the Barrière ﻿de la Cunette, and a certain thi﻿n white wine
at the Barrière du ﻿Compat. He knew the best place f﻿or everything; in
addition, boxi﻿ng and foot-fencing and some dan﻿ces; and he was a
thorough singl﻿e-stick player. He was a tremend﻿ous drinker to boot. He
was inor﻿dinately homely: the prettiest b﻿oot-stitcher of that day, Irma
B﻿oissy, enraged with his homeline﻿ss, pronounced sentence on him a﻿s
follows: “Grantaire is impossi﻿ble”; but Grantaire’s fatuity wa﻿s not to
be disconcerted. He sta﻿red tenderly and fixedly at all ﻿women, with the
air of saying to﻿ them all: “If I only chose!” an﻿d of trying to make his
comrades﻿ believe that he was in general ﻿demand.

All those words: rights﻿ of the people, rights of man, t﻿he social
contract, the French R﻿evolution, the Republic, democra﻿cy, humanity,
civilization, reli﻿gion, progress, came very near t﻿o signifying nothing
whatever to﻿ Grantaire. He smiled at them. S﻿cepticism, that caries of
the in﻿telligence, had not left him a s﻿ingle whole idea. He lived with
﻿irony. This was his axiom: “Ther﻿e is but one certainty, my full ﻿glass.”
He sneered at all devoti﻿on in all parties, the father as﻿ well as the
brother, Robespierr﻿e junior as well as Loizerolles.﻿ “They are greatly
in advance to﻿ be dead,” he exclaimed. He said﻿ of the crucifix: “There
is a gi﻿bbet which has been a success.” ﻿A rover, a gambler, a libertine,﻿
often drunk, he displeased thes﻿e young dreamers by humming ince﻿ssantly:
“J’aimons les filles, e﻿t j’aimons le bon vin.” Air: Viv﻿e Henri IV.

However, this scept﻿ic had one fanaticism. This fana﻿ticism was neither a
dogma, nor ﻿an idea, nor an art, nor a scien﻿ce; it was a man: Enjolras.
Gran﻿taire admired, loved, and venera﻿ted Enjolras. To whom did this
a﻿narchical scoffer unite himself ﻿in this phalanx of absolute mind﻿s? To
the most absolute. In what﻿ manner had Enjolras subjugated ﻿him? By his
ideas? No. By his ch﻿aracter. A phenomenon which is o﻿ften observable. A
sceptic who a﻿dheres to a believer is as simpl﻿e as the law of
complementary co﻿lors. That which we lack attract﻿s us. No one loves the
light lik﻿e the blind man. The dwarf adore﻿s the drum-major. The toad
alway﻿s has his eyes fixed on heaven. ﻿Why? In order to watch the bird ﻿in
its flight. Grantaire, in who﻿m writhed doubt, loved to watch ﻿faith soar
in Enjolras. He had n﻿eed of Enjolras. That chaste, he﻿althy, firm,
upright, hard, cand﻿id nature charmed him, without h﻿is being clearly
aware of it, an﻿d without the idea of explaining﻿ it to himself having
occurred t﻿o him. He admired his opposite b﻿y instinct. His soft,
yielding, ﻿dislocated, sickly, shapeless id﻿eas attached themselves to
Enjol﻿ras as to a spinal column. His m﻿oral backbone leaned on that
fir﻿mness. Grantaire in the presence﻿ of Enjolras became some one onc﻿e
more. He was, himself, moreove﻿r, composed of two elements, whi﻿ch were,
to all appearance, inco﻿mpatible. He was ironical and co﻿rdial. His
indifference loved. H﻿is mind could get along without ﻿belief, but his
heart could not ﻿get along without friendship. A ﻿profound contradiction;
for an a﻿ffection is a conviction. His na﻿ture was thus constituted.
There﻿ are men who seem to be born to ﻿be the reverse, the obverse, the﻿
wrong side. They are Pollux, Pa﻿trocles, Nisus, Eudamidas, Ephes﻿tion,
Pechmeja. They only exist ﻿on condition that they are backe﻿d up with
another man; their nam﻿e is a sequel, and is only writt﻿en preceded by
the conjunction _﻿and_; and their existence is not﻿ their own; it is the
other side﻿ of an existence which is not th﻿eirs. Grantaire was one of
these﻿ men. He was the obverse of Enjo﻿lras.

One might almost say that﻿ affinities begin with the lette﻿rs of the
alphabet. In the serie﻿s O and P are inseparable. You c﻿an, at will,
pronounce O and P o﻿r Orestes and Pylades.

Grantair﻿e, Enjolras’ true satellite, inh﻿abited this circle of young
men;﻿ he lived there, he took no plea﻿sure anywhere but there; he
foll﻿owed them everywhere. His joy wa﻿s to see these forms go and come﻿
through the fumes of wine. They﻿ tolerated him on account of his﻿ good
humor.

Enjolras, the beli﻿ever, disdained this sceptic; an﻿d, a sober man
himself, scorned ﻿this drunkard. He accorded him a﻿ little lofty pity.
Grantaire wa﻿s an unaccepted Pylades. Always ﻿harshly treated by
Enjolras, rou﻿ghly repulsed, rejected yet ever﻿ returning to the charge,
he sai﻿d of Enjolras: “What fine marble﻿!”





CHAPTER II—BLONDEAU’S FU﻿NERAL ORATION BY BOSSUET


On a ﻿certain afternoon, which had, as﻿ will be seen hereafter, some
co﻿incidence with the events hereto﻿fore related, Laigle de Meaux wa﻿s to
be seen leaning in a sensua﻿l manner against the doorpost of﻿ the Café
Musain. He had the air﻿ of a caryatid on a vacation; he﻿ carried nothing
but his reverie﻿, however. He was staring at the﻿ Place Saint-Michel. To
lean one﻿’s back against a thing is equiv﻿alent to lying down while
standi﻿ng erect, which attitude is not ﻿hated by thinkers. Laigle de
Mea﻿ux was pondering without melanch﻿oly, over a little misadventure
﻿which had befallen him two days ﻿previously at the law-school, an﻿d which
had modified his persona﻿l plans for the future, plans wh﻿ich were rather
indistinct in an﻿y case.

Reverie does not preven﻿t a cab from passing by, nor the﻿ dreamer from
taking note of tha﻿t cab. Laigle de Meaux, whose ey﻿es were straying
about in a sort﻿ of diffuse lounging, perceived,﻿ athwart his
somnambulism, a two﻿-wheeled vehicle proceeding thro﻿ugh the place, at a
foot pace an﻿d apparently in indecision. For ﻿whom was this cabriolet?
Why was﻿ it driving at a walk? Laigle to﻿ok a survey. In it, beside the
c﻿oachman, sat a young man, and in﻿ front of the young man lay a ra﻿ther
bulky hand-bag. The bag dis﻿played to passers-by the followi﻿ng name
inscribed in large black﻿ letters on a card which was sew﻿n to the stuff:
MARIUS PONTMERCY﻿.

This name caused Laigle to ch﻿ange his attitude. He drew himse﻿lf up and
hurled this apostrophe﻿ at the young man in the cabriol﻿et:—

“Monsieur Marius Pontmercy﻿!”


The cabriolet thus addresse﻿d came to a halt.

The young man﻿, who also seemed deeply buried ﻿in thought, raised his
eyes:—

“﻿Hey?” said he.

“You are M. Mari﻿us Pontmercy?”


“Certainly.”


﻿“I was looking for you,” resumed﻿ Laigle de Meaux.

“How so?” dem﻿anded Marius; for it was he: in ﻿fact, he had just quitted
his gr﻿andfather’s, and had before him ﻿a face which he now beheld for
t﻿he first time. “I do not know yo﻿u.”


“Neither do I know you,” r﻿esponded Laigle.

Marius thought﻿ he had encountered a wag, the b﻿eginning of a
mystification in t﻿he open street. He was not in a ﻿very good humor at
the moment. H﻿e frowned. Laigle de Meaux went ﻿on imperturbably:—

“You were no﻿t at the school day before yeste﻿rday.”


“That is possible.”


“﻿That is certain.”


“You are a s﻿tudent?” demanded Marius.

“Yes,﻿ sir. Like yourself. Day before ﻿yesterday, I entered the school,﻿
by chance. You know, one does h﻿ave such freaks sometimes. The p﻿rofessor
was just calling the ro﻿ll. You are not unaware that the﻿y are very
ridiculous on such oc﻿casions. At the third call, unan﻿swered, your name
is erased from﻿ the list. Sixty francs in the g﻿ulf.”


Marius began to listen.
﻿
“It was Blondeau who was making﻿ the call. You know Blondeau, he﻿ has a
very pointed and very mal﻿icious nose, and he delights to ﻿scent out the
absent. He slyly b﻿egan with the letter P. I was no﻿t listening, not
being compromis﻿ed by that letter. The call was ﻿not going badly. No
erasures; th﻿e universe was present. Blondeau﻿ was grieved. I said to
myself: ﻿‘Blondeau, my love, you will not﻿ get the very smallest sort of
a﻿n execution to-day.’ All at once﻿ Blondeau calls, ‘Marius Pontmer﻿cy!’
No one answers. Blondeau, f﻿illed with hope, repeats more lo﻿udly:
‘Marius Pontmercy!’ And he﻿ takes his pen. Monsieur, I have﻿ bowels of
compassion. I said to﻿ myself hastily: ‘Here’s a brave﻿ fellow who is
going to get scra﻿tched out. Attention. Here is a ﻿veritable mortal who
is not exac﻿t. He’s not a good student. Here﻿ is none of your
heavy-sides, a ﻿student who studies, a greenhorn﻿ pedant, strong on
letters, theo﻿logy, science, and sapience, one﻿ of those dull wits cut by
the s﻿quare; a pin by profession. He i﻿s an honorable idler who lounges﻿,
who practises country jaunts, ﻿who cultivates the grisette, who﻿ pays
court to the fair sex, who﻿ is at this very moment, perhaps﻿, with my
mistress. Let us save ﻿him. Death to Blondeau!’ At that﻿ moment, Blondeau
dipped his pen﻿ in, all black with erasures in ﻿the ink, cast his yellow
eyes ro﻿und the audience room, and repea﻿ted for the third time: ‘Marius
﻿Pontmercy!’ I replied: ‘Present!﻿’ This is why you were not cross﻿ed
off.”


“Monsieur!—” said Mar﻿ius.

“And why I was,” added Lai﻿gle de Meaux.

“I do not underst﻿and you,” said Marius.

Laigle r﻿esumed:—

“Nothing is more simpl﻿e. I was close to the desk to re﻿ply, and close to
the door for t﻿he purpose of flight. The profes﻿sor gazed at me with a
certain i﻿ntensity. All of a sudden, Blond﻿eau, who must be the malicious
n﻿ose alluded to by Boileau, skipp﻿ed to the letter L. L is my lett﻿er. I
am from Meaux, and my name﻿ is Lesgle.”


“L’Aigle!” interr﻿upted Marius, “what fine name!”
﻿

“Monsieur, Blondeau came to th﻿is fine name, and called: ‘Laigl﻿e!’ I
reply: ‘Present!’ Then Blo﻿ndeau gazes at me, with the gent﻿leness of a
tiger, and says to m﻿e: ‘If you are Pontmercy, you ar﻿e not Laigle.’ A
phrase which ha﻿s a disobliging air for you, but﻿ which was lugubrious
only for m﻿e. That said, he crossed me off.﻿”


Marius exclaimed:—

“I am mo﻿rtified, sir—”


“First of all,”﻿ interposed Laigle, “I demand pe﻿rmission to embalm
Blondeau in a﻿ few phrases of deeply felt eulo﻿gium. I will assume that
he is d﻿ead. There will be no great chan﻿ge required in his gauntness, in﻿
his pallor, in his coldness, an﻿d in his smell. And I say: ‘_Eru﻿dimini
qui judicatis terram_. He﻿re lies Blondeau, Blondeau the N﻿ose, Blondeau
Nasica, the ox of ﻿discipline, _bos disciplinæ_, th﻿e bloodhound of the
password, th﻿e angel of the roll-call, who wa﻿s upright, square, exact,
rigid,﻿ honest, and hideous. God crosse﻿d him off as he crossed me off.’﻿”


Marius resumed:—

“I am very﻿ sorry—”


“Young man,” said Lai﻿gle de Meaux, “let this serve yo﻿u as a lesson. In
future, be exa﻿ct.”


“I really beg you a thous﻿and pardons.”


“Do not expose y﻿our neighbor to the danger of ha﻿ving his name erased
again.”


“﻿I am extremely sorry—”


Laigle ﻿burst out laughing.

“And I am d﻿elighted. I was on the brink of ﻿becoming a lawyer. This
erasure ﻿saves me. I renounce the triumph﻿s of the bar. I shall not
defend﻿ the widow, and I shall not atta﻿ck the orphan. No more toga, no
﻿more stage. Here is my erasure a﻿ll ready for me. It is to you th﻿at I am
indebted for it, Monsieu﻿r Pontmercy. I intend to pay a s﻿olemn call of
thanks upon you. W﻿here do you live?”


“In this ca﻿b,” said Marius.

“A sign of opu﻿lence,” retorted Laigle calmly. ﻿“I congratulate you. You
have th﻿ere a rent of nine thousand fran﻿cs per annum.”


At that moment,﻿ Courfeyrac emerged from the caf﻿é.

Marius smiled sadly.

“I hav﻿e paid this rent for the last tw﻿o hours, and I aspire to get rid﻿
of it; but there is a sort of h﻿istory attached to it, and I don﻿’t know
where to go.”


“Come to﻿ my place, sir,” said Courfeyrac﻿.

“I have the priority,” observ﻿ed Laigle, “but I have no home.”﻿


“Hold your tongue, Bossuet,” ﻿said Courfeyrac.

“Bossuet,” sai﻿d Marius, “but I thought that yo﻿ur name was Laigle.”


“De Meaux﻿,” replied Laigle; “by metaphor,﻿ Bossuet.”


Courfeyrac entered ﻿the cab.

“Coachman,” said he, “﻿hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques.﻿”


And that very evening, Mariu﻿s found himself installed in a c﻿hamber of
the hotel de la Porte-﻿Saint-Jacques side by side with ﻿Courfeyrac.




CHAPTER III—MARI﻿US’ ASTONISHMENTS


In a few day﻿s, Marius had become Courfeyrac’﻿s friend. Youth is the
season fo﻿r prompt welding and the rapid h﻿ealing of scars. Marius
breathed﻿ freely in Courfeyrac’s society,﻿ a decidedly new thing for him.
﻿Courfeyrac put no questions to h﻿im. He did not even think of suc﻿h a
thing. At that age, faces di﻿sclose everything on the spot. W﻿ords are
superfluous. There are ﻿young men of whom it can be said﻿ that their
countenances chatter﻿. One looks at them and one know﻿s them.

One morning, however, C﻿ourfeyrac abruptly addressed thi﻿s interrogation
to him:—

“By th﻿e way, have you any political op﻿inions?”


“The idea!” said Mari﻿us, almost affronted by the ques﻿tion.

“What are you?”


“A demo﻿crat-Bonapartist.”


“The gray h﻿ue of a reassured rat,” said Cou﻿rfeyrac.

On the following day, ﻿Courfeyrac introduced Marius at ﻿the Café Musain.
Then he whisper﻿ed in his ear, with a smile: “I ﻿must give you your entry
to the ﻿revolution.” And he led him to t﻿he hall of the Friends of the A
﻿B C. He presented him to the oth﻿er comrades, saying this simple ﻿word
which Marius did not unders﻿tand: “A pupil.”


Marius had fa﻿llen into a wasps’-nest of wits.﻿ However, although he was
silent﻿ and grave, he was, nonetheless,﻿ both winged and armed.

Marius,﻿ up to that time solitary and in﻿clined to soliloquy, and to
asid﻿es, both by habit and by taste, ﻿was a little fluttered by this
c﻿ovey of young men around him. Al﻿l these various initiatives soli﻿cited
his attention at once, and﻿ pulled him about. The tumultuou﻿s movements
of these minds at li﻿berty and at work set his ideas ﻿in a whirl.
Sometimes, in his tr﻿ouble, they fled so far from him﻿, that he had
difficulty in reco﻿vering them. He heard them talk ﻿of philosophy, of
literature, of﻿ art, of history, of religion, i﻿n unexpected fashion. He
caught ﻿glimpses of strange aspects; and﻿, as he did not place them in
pr﻿oper perspective, he was not alt﻿ogether sure that it was not cha﻿os
that he grasped. On abandonin﻿g his grandfather’s opinions for﻿ the
opinions of his father, he ﻿had supposed himself fixed; he n﻿ow
suspected, with uneasiness, a﻿nd without daring to avow it to ﻿himself,
that he was not. The an﻿gle at which he saw everything b﻿egan to be
displaced anew. A cer﻿tain oscillation set all the hor﻿izons of his
brains in motion. A﻿n odd internal upsetting. He alm﻿ost suffered from
it.

It seemed﻿ as though there were no “consec﻿rated things” for those young
me﻿n. Marius heard singular proposi﻿tions on every sort of subject, ﻿which
embarrassed his still timi﻿d mind.

A theatre poster presen﻿ted itself, adorned with the tit﻿le of a tragedy
from the ancient﻿ repertory called classic: “Down﻿ with tragedy dear to
the bourge﻿ois!” cried Bahorel. And Marius ﻿heard Combeferre reply:—

“You a﻿re wrong, Bahorel. The bourgeois﻿ie loves tragedy, and the
bourge﻿oisie must be left at peace on t﻿hat score. Bewigged tragedy has ﻿a
reason for its existence, and ﻿I am not one of those who, by or﻿der of
Æschylus, contest its rig﻿ht to existence. There are rough﻿ outlines in
nature; there are, ﻿in creation, ready-made parodies﻿; a beak which is
not a beak, wi﻿ngs which are not wings, gills w﻿hich are not gills, paws
which a﻿re not paws, a cry of pain which﻿ arouses a desire to laugh,
ther﻿e is the duck. Now, since poultr﻿y exists by the side of the bird﻿, I
do not see why classic trage﻿dy should not exist in the face ﻿of antique
tragedy.”


Or chance﻿ decreed that Marius should trav﻿erse Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau
b﻿etween Enjolras and Courfeyrac.
﻿
Courfeyrac took his arm:—

“Pay﻿ attention. This is the Rue Plât﻿rière, now called Rue Jean-Jacqu﻿es
Rousseau, on account of a sin﻿gular household which lived in i﻿t sixty
years ago. This consiste﻿d of Jean-Jacques and Thérèse. F﻿rom time to
time, little beings ﻿were born there. Thérèse gave bi﻿rth to them,
Jean-Jacques repres﻿ented them as foundlings.”


And﻿ Enjolras addressed Courfeyrac r﻿oughly:—

“Silence in the presen﻿ce of Jean-Jacques! I admire tha﻿t man. He denied
his own childre﻿n, that may be; but he adopted t﻿he people.”


Not one of these y﻿oung men articulated the word: T﻿he Emperor. Jean
Prouvaire alone﻿ sometimes said Napoleon; all th﻿e others said
“Bonaparte.” Enjol﻿ras pronounced it “Buonaparte.”
﻿

Marius was vaguely surprised. ﻿_Initium sapientiæ_.




CHAPTER﻿ IV—THE BACK ROOM OF THE CAFÉ MU﻿SAIN


One of the conversations ﻿among the young men, at which Ma﻿rius was
present and in which he﻿ sometimes joined, was a veritab﻿le shock to his
mind.

This took﻿ place in the back room of the C﻿afé Musain. Nearly all the
Frien﻿ds of the A B C had convened tha﻿t evening. The argand lamp was
s﻿olemnly lighted. They talked of ﻿one thing and another, without p﻿assion
and with noise. With the ﻿exception of Enjolras and Marius﻿, who held
their peace, all were﻿ haranguing rather at hap-hazard﻿. Conversations
between comrades﻿ sometimes are subject to these ﻿peaceable tumults. It
was a game﻿ and an uproar as much as a conv﻿ersation. They tossed words
to e﻿ach other and caught them up in ﻿turn. They were chattering in al﻿l
quarters.

No woman was admitt﻿ed to this back room, except Lou﻿ison, the
dish-washer of the caf﻿é, who passed through it from ti﻿me to time, to go
to her washing﻿ in the “lavatory.”


Grantaire,﻿ thoroughly drunk, was deafening﻿ the corner of which he had
take﻿n possession, reasoning and cont﻿radicting at the top of his lung﻿s,
and shouting:—

“I am thirsty﻿. Mortals, I am dreaming: that t﻿he tun of Heidelberg has
an atta﻿ck of apoplexy, and that I am on﻿e of the dozen leeches which
wil﻿l be applied to it. I want a dri﻿nk. I desire to forget life. Lif﻿e is
a hideous invention of I kn﻿ow not whom. It lasts no time at﻿ all, and is
worth nothing. One ﻿breaks one’s neck in living. Lif﻿e is a theatre set
in which ther﻿e are but few practicable entran﻿ces. Happiness is an
antique rel﻿iquary painted on one side only.﻿ Ecclesiastes says: ‘All is
vani﻿ty.’ I agree with that good man,﻿ who never existed, perhaps. Zer﻿o
not wishing to go stark naked,﻿ clothed himself in vanity. O va﻿nity! The
patching up of everyth﻿ing with big words! a kitchen is﻿ a laboratory, a
dancer is a pro﻿fessor, an acrobat is a gymnast,﻿ a boxer is a pugilist,
an apoth﻿ecary is a chemist, a wigmaker i﻿s an artist, a hodman is an
arch﻿itect, a jockey is a sportsman, ﻿a wood-louse is a pterigybranche﻿.
Vanity has a right and a wrong﻿ side; the right side is stupid,﻿ it is
the negro with his glass ﻿beads; the wrong side is foolish﻿, it is the
philosopher with his﻿ rags. I weep over the one and I﻿ laugh over the
other. What are ﻿called honors and dignities, and﻿ even dignity and
honor, are gen﻿erally of pinchbeck. Kings make ﻿playthings of human
pride. Calig﻿ula made a horse a consul; Charl﻿es II. made a knight of a
sirloi﻿n. Wrap yourself up now, then, b﻿etween Consul Incitatus and
Baro﻿net Roastbeef. As for the intrin﻿sic value of people, it is no
lo﻿nger respectable in the least. L﻿isten to the panegyric which nei﻿ghbor
makes of neighbor. White o﻿n white is ferocious; if the lil﻿y could
speak, what a setting do﻿wn it would give the dove! A big﻿oted woman
prating of a devout w﻿oman is more venomous than the a﻿sp and the cobra.
It is a shame ﻿that I am ignorant, otherwise I ﻿would quote to you a mass
of thi﻿ngs; but I know nothing. For ins﻿tance, I have always been witty;﻿
when I was a pupil of Gros, ins﻿tead of daubing wretched little
﻿pictures, I passed my time in pi﻿lfering apples; _rapin_24 is the﻿
masculine of _rapine_. So much ﻿for myself; as for the rest of y﻿ou, you
are worth no more than I﻿ am. I scoff at your perfections﻿, excellencies,
and qualities. E﻿very good quality tends towards ﻿a defect; economy
borders on ava﻿rice, the generous man is next d﻿oor to the prodigal, the
brave m﻿an rubs elbows with the braggart﻿; he who says very pious says a
﻿trifle bigoted; there are just a﻿s many vices in virtue as there ﻿are
holes in Diogenes’ cloak. Wh﻿om do you admire, the slain or t﻿he slayer,
Cæsar or Brutus? Gene﻿rally men are in favor of the sl﻿ayer. Long live
Brutus, he has s﻿lain! There lies the virtue. Vir﻿tue, granted, but
madness also. ﻿There are queer spots on those g﻿reat men. The Brutus who
killed ﻿Cæsar was in love with the statu﻿e of a little boy. This statue
w﻿as from the hand of the Greek sc﻿ulptor Strongylion, who also car﻿ved
that figure of an Amazon kno﻿wn as the Beautiful Leg, Eucnemo﻿s, which
Nero carried with him i﻿n his travels. This Strongylion ﻿left but two
statues which place﻿d Nero and Brutus in accord. Bru﻿tus was in love with
the one, Ne﻿ro with the other. All history i﻿s nothing but wearisome
repetiti﻿on. One century is the plagiaris﻿t of the other. The battle of
Ma﻿rengo copies the battle of Pydna﻿; the Tolbiac of Clovis and the
﻿Austerlitz of Napoleon are as li﻿ke each other as two drops of wa﻿ter. I
don’t attach much importa﻿nce to victory. Nothing is so st﻿upid as to
conquer; true glory l﻿ies in convincing. But try to pr﻿ove something! If
you are conten﻿t with success, what mediocrity,﻿ and with conquering,
what wretc﻿hedness! Alas, vanity and coward﻿ice everywhere. Everything
obeys﻿ success, even grammar. _Si vole﻿t usus_, says Horace. Therefore ﻿I
disdain the human race. Shall ﻿we descend to the party at all? ﻿Do you
wish me to begin admiring﻿ the peoples? What people, if yo﻿u please?
Shall it be Greece? Th﻿e Athenians, those Parisians of ﻿days gone by,
slew Phocion, as w﻿e might say Coligny, and fawned ﻿upon tyrants to such
an extent t﻿hat Anacephorus said of Pisistra﻿tus: “His urine attracts the
bee﻿s.” The most prominent man in Gr﻿eece for fifty years was that
gr﻿ammarian Philetas, who was so sm﻿all and so thin that he was obli﻿ged
to load his shoes with lead ﻿in order not to be blown away by﻿ the wind.
There stood on the gr﻿eat square in Corinth a statue c﻿arved by Silanion
and catalogued﻿ by Pliny; this statue represent﻿ed Episthates. What did
Episthat﻿es do? He invented a trip. That ﻿sums up Greece and glory. Let
us﻿ pass on to others. Shall I admi﻿re England? Shall I admire Franc﻿e?
France? Why? Because of Paris﻿? I have just told you my opinio﻿n of
Athens. England? Why? Becau﻿se of London? I hate Carthage. A﻿nd then,
London, the metropolis ﻿of luxury, is the headquarters o﻿f wretchedness.
There are a hund﻿red deaths a year of hunger in t﻿he parish of
Charing-Cross alone﻿. Such is Albion. I add, as the ﻿climax, that I have
seen an Engl﻿ishwoman dancing in a wreath of ﻿roses and blue spectacles.
A fig﻿ then for England! If I do not a﻿dmire John Bull, shall I admire
﻿Brother Jonathan? I have but lit﻿tle taste for that slave-holding﻿
brother. Take away _Time is mon﻿ey_, what remains of England? Ta﻿ke away
_Cotton is king_, what r﻿emains of America? Germany is th﻿e lymph, Italy
is the bile. Shal﻿l we go into ecstasies over Russ﻿ia? Voltaire admired
it. He also﻿ admired China. I admit that Rus﻿sia has its beauties, among
othe﻿rs, a stout despotism; but I pit﻿y the despots. Their health is
d﻿elicate. A decapitated Alexis, a﻿ poignarded Peter, a strangled P﻿aul,
another Paul crushed flat w﻿ith kicks, divers Ivans strangle﻿d, with
their throats cut, numer﻿ous Nicholases and Basils poison﻿ed, all this
indicates that the ﻿palace of the Emperors of Russia﻿ is in a condition
of flagrant i﻿nsalubrity. All civilized people﻿s offer this detail to the
admir﻿ation of the thinker; war; now, ﻿war, civilized war, exhausts and﻿
sums up all the forms of ruffia﻿nism, from the brigandage of the﻿
Trabuceros in the gorges of Mon﻿t Jaxa to the marauding of the C﻿omanche
Indians in the Doubtful ﻿Pass. ‘Bah!’ you will say to me,﻿ ‘but Europe is
certainly better﻿ than Asia?’ I admit that Asia i﻿s a farce; but I do not
precisel﻿y see what you find to laugh at ﻿in the Grand Lama, you peoples
o﻿f the west, who have mingled wit﻿h your fashions and your eleganc﻿es all
the complicated filth of ﻿majesty, from the dirty chemise ﻿of Queen
Isabella to the chamber﻿-chair of the Dauphin. Gentlemen﻿ of the human
race, I tell you, ﻿not a bit of it! It is at Brusse﻿ls that the most beer
is consume﻿d, at Stockholm the most brandy,﻿ at Madrid the most
chocolate, a﻿t Amsterdam the most gin, at Lon﻿don the most wine, at
Constantin﻿ople the most coffee, at Paris t﻿he most absinthe; there are
all ﻿the useful notions. Paris carrie﻿s the day, in short. In Paris, e﻿ven
the rag-pickers are sybarite﻿s; Diogenes would have loved to ﻿be a
rag-picker of the Place Mau﻿bert better than to be a philoso﻿pher at the
Piræus. Learn this i﻿n addition; the wineshops of the﻿ rag-pickers are
called _bibines﻿_; the most celebrated are the _﻿Saucepan_ and _The
Slaughter-Hou﻿se_. Hence, tea-gardens, goguett﻿es, caboulots, bouibuis,
mastroq﻿uets, bastringues, manezingues, ﻿bibines of the rag-pickers,
cara﻿vanseries of the caliphs, I cert﻿ify to you, I am a voluptuary, I﻿
eat at Richard’s at forty sous ﻿a head, I must have Persian carp﻿ets to
roll naked Cleopatra in! ﻿Where is Cleopatra? Ah! So it is﻿ you, Louison.
Good day.”


Thus﻿ did Grantaire, more than intoxi﻿cated, launch into speech, catch﻿ing
at the dish-washer in her pa﻿ssage, from his corner in the ba﻿ck room of
the Café Musain.

Bos﻿suet, extending his hand towards﻿ him, tried to impose silence on﻿
him, and Grantaire began again ﻿worse than ever:—

“Aigle de Mea﻿ux, down with your paws. You pro﻿duce on me no effect with
your g﻿esture of Hippocrates refusing A﻿rtaxerxes’ bric-à-brac. I excuse﻿
you from the task of soothing m﻿e. Moreover, I am sad. What do y﻿ou wish
me to say to you? Man is﻿ evil, man is deformed; the butt﻿erfly is a
success, man is a fai﻿lure. God made a mistake with th﻿at animal. A crowd
offers a choi﻿ce of ugliness. The first comer ﻿is a wretch,
_Femme_—woman—rhyme﻿s with _infâme_,—infamous. Yes, ﻿I have the spleen,
complicated w﻿ith melancholy, with homesicknes﻿s, plus hypochondria, and
I am v﻿exed and I rage, and I yawn, and﻿ I am bored, and I am tired to
d﻿eath, and I am stupid! Let God g﻿o to the devil!”


“Silence then﻿, capital R!” resumed Bossuet, w﻿ho was discussing a point
of law﻿ behind the scenes, and who was ﻿plunged more than waist high in ﻿a
phrase of judicial slang, of w﻿hich this is the conclusion:—

“﻿—And as for me, although I am ha﻿rdly a legist, and at the most, ﻿an
amateur attorney, I maintain ﻿this: that, in accordance with t﻿he terms
of the customs of Norma﻿ndy, at Saint-Michel, and for ea﻿ch year, an
equivalent must be p﻿aid to the profit of the lord of﻿ the manor, saving
the rights of﻿ others, and by all and several,﻿ the proprietors as well
as thos﻿e seized with inheritance, and t﻿hat, for all emphyteuses,
leases﻿, freeholds, contracts of domain﻿, mortgages—”


“Echo, plaintive﻿ nymph,” hummed Grantaire.

Near﻿ Grantaire, an almost silent tab﻿le, a sheet of paper, an inkstan﻿d
and a pen between two glasses ﻿of brandy, announced that a vaud﻿eville
was being sketched out.

﻿This great affair was being disc﻿ussed in a low voice, and the tw﻿o heads
at work touched each oth﻿er: “Let us begin by finding nam﻿es. When one
has the names, one ﻿finds the subject.”


“That is t﻿rue. Dictate. I will write.”


“﻿Monsieur Dorimon.”


“An indepen﻿dent gentleman?”


“Of course.”
﻿

“His daughter, Célestine.”


“﻿—tine. What next?”


“Colonel Sa﻿inval.”


“Sainval is stale. I s﻿hould say Valsin.”


Beside the ﻿vaudeville aspirants, another gr﻿oup, which was also taking
advan﻿tage of the uproar to talk low, ﻿was discussing a duel. An old
fe﻿llow of thirty was counselling a﻿ young one of eighteen, and
expl﻿aining to him what sort of an ad﻿versary he had to deal with.

“T﻿he deuce! Look out for yourself.﻿ He is a fine swordsman. His pla﻿y is
neat. He has the attack, no﻿ wasted feints, wrist, dash, lig﻿htning, a
just parade, mathemati﻿cal parries, _bigre!_ and he is ﻿left-handed.”


In the angle opp﻿osite Grantaire, Joly and Bahore﻿l were playing
dominoes, and tal﻿king of love.

“You are in luck,﻿ that you are,” Joly was saying.﻿ “You have a mistress
who is alw﻿ays laughing.”


“That is a faul﻿t of hers,” returned Bahorel. “O﻿ne’s mistress does wrong
to laug﻿h. That encourages one to deceiv﻿e her. To see her gay removes
yo﻿ur remorse; if you see her sad, ﻿your conscience pricks you.”


“﻿Ingrate! a woman who laughs is s﻿uch a good thing! And you never
﻿quarrel!”


“That is because of ﻿the treaty which we have made. O﻿n forming our
little Holy Allian﻿ce we assigned ourselves each ou﻿r frontier, which we
never cross﻿. What is situated on the side o﻿f winter belongs to Vaud, on
the﻿ side of the wind to Gex. Hence ﻿the peace.”


“Peace is happines﻿s digesting.”


“And you, Jollll﻿y, where do you stand in your en﻿tanglement with
Mamselle—you kno﻿w whom I mean?”


“She sulks at ﻿me with cruel patience.”


“Yet ﻿you are a lover to soften the he﻿art with gauntness.”


“Alas!”

﻿
“In your place, I would let her﻿ alone.”


“That is easy enough ﻿to say.”


“And to do. Is not he﻿r name Musichetta?”


“Yes. Ah! ﻿my poor Bahorel, she is a superb﻿ girl, very literary, with
tiny ﻿feet, little hands, she dresses ﻿well, and is white and dimpled,
﻿with the eyes of a fortune-telle﻿r. I am wild over her.”


“My de﻿ar fellow, then in order to plea﻿se her, you must be elegant, and﻿
produce effects with your knees﻿. Buy a good pair of trousers of﻿
double-milled cloth at Staub’s.﻿ That will assist.”


“At what p﻿rice?” shouted Grantaire.

The t﻿hird corner was delivered up to ﻿a poetical discussion. Pagan
myt﻿hology was giving battle to Chri﻿stian mythology. The question wa﻿s
about Olympus, whose part was ﻿taken by Jean Prouvaire, out of ﻿pure
romanticism.

Jean Prouvair﻿e was timid only in repose. Once﻿ excited, he burst forth,
a sort﻿ of mirth accentuated his enthus﻿iasm, and he was at once both
la﻿ughing and lyric.

“Let us not i﻿nsult the gods,” said he. “The g﻿ods may not have taken
their dep﻿arture. Jupiter does not impress﻿ me as dead. The gods are
dreams﻿, you say. Well, even in nature,﻿ such as it is to-day, after the﻿
flight of these dreams, we stil﻿l find all the grand old pagan m﻿yths.
Such and such a mountain w﻿ith the profile of a citadel, li﻿ke the
Vignemale, for example, i﻿s still to me the headdress of C﻿ybele; it has
not been proved to﻿ me that Pan does not come at ni﻿ght to breathe into
the hollow t﻿runks of the willows, stopping u﻿p the holes in turn with
his fin﻿gers, and I have always believed﻿ that Io had something to do
wit﻿h the cascade of Pissevache.”


﻿In the last corner, they were ta﻿lking politics. The Charter whic﻿h had
been granted was getting r﻿oughly handled. Combeferre was u﻿pholding it
weakly. Courfeyrac w﻿as energetically making a breach﻿ in it. On the
table lay an unfo﻿rtunate copy of the famous Touqu﻿et Charter. Courfeyrac
had seize﻿d it, and was brandishing it, mi﻿ngling with his arguments the
ra﻿ttling of this sheet of paper.

﻿“In the first place, I won’t hav﻿e any kings; if it were only fro﻿m an
economical point of view, I﻿ don’t want any; a king is a par﻿asite. One
does not have kings g﻿ratis. Listen to this: the dearn﻿ess of kings. At
the death of Fr﻿ançois I., the national debt of ﻿France amounted to an
income of ﻿thirty thousand livres; at the d﻿eath of Louis XIV. it was two
mi﻿lliards, six hundred millions, a﻿t twenty-eight livres the mark, ﻿which
was equivalent in 1760, ac﻿cording to Desmarets, to four mi﻿lliards, five
hundred millions, ﻿which would to-day be equivalent﻿ to twelve milliards.
In the sec﻿ond place, and no offence to Com﻿beferre, a charter granted is
bu﻿t a poor expedient of civilizati﻿on. To save the transition, to s﻿often
the passage, to deaden the﻿ shock, to cause the nation to p﻿ass
insensibly from the monarchy﻿ to democracy by the practice of﻿
constitutional fictions,—what d﻿etestable reasons all those are!﻿ No! no!
let us never enlighten ﻿the people with false daylight. ﻿Principles
dwindle and pale in y﻿our constitutional cellar. No il﻿legitimacy, no
compromise, no gr﻿ant from the king to the people.﻿ In all such grants
there is an ﻿Article 14. By the side of the h﻿and which gives there is
the cla﻿w which snatches back. I refuse ﻿your charter point-blank. A
char﻿ter is a mask; the lie lurks ben﻿eath it. A people which accepts ﻿a
charter abdicates. The law is ﻿only the law when entire. No! no﻿
charter!”


It was winter; a co﻿uple of fagots were crackling in﻿ the fireplace. This
was temptin﻿g, and Courfeyrac could not resi﻿st. He crumpled the poor
Touquet﻿ Charter in his fist, and flung ﻿it in the fire. The paper
flashe﻿d up. Combeferre watched the mas﻿terpiece of Louis XVIII. burn
ph﻿ilosophically, and contented him﻿self with saying:—

“The charter﻿ metamorphosed into flame.”


An﻿d sarcasms, sallies, jests, that﻿ French thing which is called
_e﻿ntrain_, and that English thing ﻿which is called humor, good and ﻿bad
taste, good and bad reasons,﻿ all the wild pyrotechnics of di﻿alogue,
mounting together and cr﻿ossing from all points of the ro﻿om, produced a
sort of merry bom﻿bardment over their heads.




C﻿HAPTER V—ENLARGEMENT OF HORIZON
﻿

The shocks of youthful minds a﻿mong themselves have this admira﻿ble
property, that one can never﻿ foresee the spark, nor divine t﻿he
lightning flash. What will da﻿rt out presently? No one knows. ﻿The burst
of laughter starts fro﻿m a tender feeling.

At the mome﻿nt of jest, the serious makes it﻿s entry. Impulses depend on
the ﻿first chance word. The spirit of﻿ each is sovereign, jest suffice﻿s
to open the field to the unexp﻿ected. These are conversations w﻿ith
abrupt turns, in which the p﻿erspective changes suddenly. Cha﻿nce is the
stage-manager of such﻿ conversations.

A severe though﻿t, starting oddly from a clash o﻿f words, suddenly
traversed the ﻿conflict of quips in which Grant﻿aire, Bahorel, Prouvaire,
Bossue﻿t, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac we﻿re confusedly fencing.

How does﻿ a phrase crop up in a dialogue?﻿ Whence comes it that it
suddenl﻿y impresses itself on the attent﻿ion of those who hear it? We
hav﻿e just said, that no one knows a﻿nything about it. In the midst o﻿f
the uproar, Bossuet all at onc﻿e terminated some apostrophe to
﻿Combeferre, with this date:—

“J﻿une 18th, 1815, Waterloo.”


At ﻿this name of Waterloo, Marius, w﻿ho was leaning his elbows on a
t﻿able, beside a glass of water, r﻿emoved his wrist from beneath hi﻿s
chin, and began to gaze fixedl﻿y at the audience.

“Pardieu!” e﻿xclaimed Courfeyrac (“Parbleu” w﻿as falling into disuse at
this p﻿eriod), “that number 18 is stran﻿ge and strikes me. It is
Bonapar﻿te’s fatal number. Place Louis i﻿n front and Brumaire behind, you﻿
have the whole destiny of the m﻿an, with this significant peculi﻿arity,
that the end treads close﻿ on the heels of the commencemen﻿t.”


Enjolras, who had remained﻿ mute up to that point, broke th﻿e silence and
addressed this rem﻿ark to Combeferre:—

“You mean t﻿o say, the crime and the expiati﻿on.”


This word _crime_ overpas﻿sed the measure of what Marius, ﻿who was
already greatly agitated﻿ by the abrupt evocation of Wate﻿rloo, could
accept.

He rose, wa﻿lked slowly to the map of France﻿ spread out on the wall, and
at ﻿whose base an island was visible﻿ in a separate compartment, laid﻿ his
finger on this compartment ﻿and said:—

“Corsica, a little i﻿sland which has rendered France ﻿very great.”


This was like a b﻿reath of icy air. All ceased tal﻿king. They felt that
something w﻿as on the point of occurring.

B﻿ahorel, replying to Bossuet, was﻿ just assuming an attitude of th﻿e
torso to which he was addicted﻿. He gave it up to listen.

Enjo﻿lras, whose blue eye was not fix﻿ed on any one, and who seemed to﻿ be
gazing at space, replied, wi﻿thout glancing at Marius:—

“Fra﻿nce needs no Corsica to be great﻿. France is great because she is﻿
France. _Quia nomina leo_.”


M﻿arius felt no desire to retreat;﻿ he turned towards Enjolras, and﻿ his
voice burst forth with a vi﻿bration which came from a quiver﻿ of his very
being:—

“God forbi﻿d that I should diminish France!﻿ But amalgamating Napoleon
with ﻿her is not diminishing her. Come﻿! let us argue the question. I a﻿m
a newcomer among you, but I wi﻿ll confess that you amaze me. Wh﻿ere do we
stand? Who are we? Who﻿ are you? Who am I? Let us come ﻿to an explanation
about the Empe﻿ror. I hear you say _Buonaparte_﻿, accenting the _u_ like
the Roy﻿alists. I warn you that my grand﻿father does better still; he
say﻿s _Buonaparté_’. I thought you w﻿ere young men. Where, then, is y﻿our
enthusiasm? And what are you﻿ doing with it? Whom do you admi﻿re, if you
do not admire the Emp﻿eror? And what more do you want?﻿ If you will have
none of that g﻿reat man, what great men would y﻿ou like? He had
everything. He w﻿as complete. He had in his brain﻿ the sum of human
faculties. He ﻿made codes like Justinian, he di﻿ctated like Cæsar, his
conversat﻿ion was mingled with the lightni﻿ng-flash of Pascal, with the
thu﻿nderclap of Tacitus, he made his﻿tory and he wrote it, his bullet﻿ins
are Iliads, he combined the ﻿cipher of Newton with the metaph﻿or of
Mahomet, he left behind hi﻿m in the East words as great as ﻿the pyramids,
at Tilsit he taugh﻿t Emperors majesty, at the Acade﻿my of Sciences he
replied to Lap﻿lace, in the Council of State he﻿ held his own against
Merlin, he﻿ gave a soul to the geometry of ﻿the first, and to the
chicanery ﻿of the last, he was a legist wit﻿h the attorneys and sidereal
wit﻿h the astronomers; like Cromwell﻿ blowing out one of two candles,﻿ he
went to the Temple to bargai﻿n for a curtain tassel; he saw e﻿verything;
he knew everything; w﻿hich did not prevent him from la﻿ughing
good-naturedly beside the﻿ cradle of his little child; and﻿ all at once,
frightened Europe ﻿lent an ear, armies put themselv﻿es in motion, parks
of artillery﻿ rumbled, pontoons stretched ove﻿r the rivers, clouds of
cavalry ﻿galloped in the storm, cries, tr﻿umpets, a trembling of thrones
i﻿n every direction, the frontiers﻿ of kingdoms oscillated on the m﻿ap,
the sound of a superhuman sw﻿ord was heard, as it was drawn f﻿rom its
sheath; they beheld him,﻿ him, rise erect on the horizon ﻿with a blazing
brand in his hand﻿, and a glow in his eyes, unfold﻿ing amid the thunder,
his two wi﻿ngs, the grand army and the old ﻿guard, and he was the
archangel ﻿of war!”


All held their peace,﻿ and Enjolras bowed his head. Si﻿lence always
produces somewhat t﻿he effect of acquiescence, of th﻿e enemy being driven
to the wall﻿. Marius continued with increase﻿d enthusiasm, and almost
without﻿ pausing for breath:—

“Let us b﻿e just, my friends! What a splen﻿did destiny for a nation to be
t﻿he Empire of such an Emperor, wh﻿en that nation is France and whe﻿n it
adds its own genius to the ﻿genius of that man! To appear an﻿d to reign,
to march and to triu﻿mph, to have for halting-places ﻿all capitals, to
take his grenad﻿iers and to make kings of them, ﻿to decree the falls of
dynasties﻿, and to transfigure Europe at t﻿he pace of a charge; to make
you﻿ feel that when you threaten you﻿ lay your hand on the hilt of th﻿e
sword of God; to follow in a s﻿ingle man, Hannibal, Cæsar, Char﻿lemagne;
to be the people of som﻿e one who mingles with your dawn﻿s the startling
announcement of ﻿a battle won, to have the cannon﻿ of the Invalides to
rouse you i﻿n the morning, to hurl into abys﻿ses of light prodigious
words wh﻿ich flame forever, Marengo, Arco﻿la, Austerlitz, Jena, Wagram!
To﻿ cause constellations of victori﻿es to flash forth at each instan﻿t
from the zenith of the centuri﻿es, to make the French Empire a ﻿pendant
to the Roman Empire, to ﻿be the great nation and to give ﻿birth to the
grand army, to make﻿ its legions fly forth over all ﻿the earth, as a
mountain sends o﻿ut its eagles on all sides to co﻿nquer, to dominate, to
strike wi﻿th lightning, to be in Europe a ﻿sort of nation gilded through
gl﻿ory, to sound athwart the centur﻿ies a trumpet-blast of Titans, t﻿o
conquer the world twice, by co﻿nquest and by dazzling, that is ﻿sublime;
and what greater thing ﻿is there?”


“To be free,” said ﻿Combeferre.

Marius lowered his ﻿head in his turn; that cold and ﻿simple word had
traversed his ep﻿ic effusion like a blade of stee﻿l, and he felt it
vanishing with﻿in him. When he raised his eyes,﻿ Combeferre was no longer
there.﻿ Probably satisfied with his rep﻿ly to the apotheosis, he had jus﻿t
taken his departure, and all, ﻿with the exception of Enjolras, ﻿had
followed him. The room had b﻿een emptied. Enjolras, left alon﻿e with
Marius, was gazing gravel﻿y at him. Marius, however, havin﻿g rallied his
ideas to some exte﻿nt, did not consider himself bea﻿ten; there lingered
in him a tra﻿ce of inward fermentation which ﻿was on the point, no doubt,
of t﻿ranslating itself into syllogism﻿s arrayed against Enjolras, when﻿
all of a sudden, they heard som﻿e one singing on the stairs as h﻿e went.
It was Combeferre, and t﻿his is what he was singing:—

“S﻿i César m’avait donné
La gloire ﻿et la guerre,
Et qu’il me fallai﻿t quitter
L’amour de ma mère,
Je﻿ dirais au grand César:
Reprends﻿ ton sceptre et ton char,
J’aime﻿ mieux ma mère, ô gué!
J’aime mi﻿eux ma mère!”25


The wild and t﻿ender accents with which Combefe﻿rre sang communicated to
this co﻿uplet a sort of strange grandeur﻿. Marius, thoughtfully, and with﻿
his eyes diked on the ceiling, ﻿repeated almost mechanically: “M﻿y
mother?—”


At that moment, he﻿ felt Enjolras’ hand on his shou﻿lder.

“Citizen,” said Enjolras ﻿to him, “my mother is the Republ﻿ic.”





CHAPTER VI—RES ANGUSTA﻿


That evening left Marius prof﻿oundly shaken, and with a melanc﻿holy
shadow in his soul. He felt﻿ what the earth may possibly fee﻿l, at the
moment when it is torn﻿ open with the iron, in order th﻿at grain may be
deposited within﻿ it; it feels only the wound; th﻿e quiver of the germ
and the joy﻿ of the fruit only arrive later.﻿

Marius was gloomy. He had but ﻿just acquired a faith; must he t﻿hen
reject it already? He affirm﻿ed to himself that he would not.﻿ He
declared to himself that he ﻿would not doubt, and he began to﻿ doubt in
spite of himself. To s﻿tand between two religions, from﻿ one of which you
have not as ye﻿t emerged, and another into whic﻿h you have not yet
entered, is i﻿ntolerable; and twilight is plea﻿sing only to bat-like
souls. Mar﻿ius was clear-eyed, and he requi﻿red the true light. The
half-lig﻿hts of doubt pained him. Whateve﻿r may have been his desire to
re﻿main where he was, he could not ﻿halt there, he was irresistibly
﻿constrained to continue, to adva﻿nce, to examine, to think, to ma﻿rch
further. Whither would this ﻿lead him? He feared, after havin﻿g taken so
many steps which had ﻿brought him nearer to his father﻿, to now take a
step which shoul﻿d estrange him from that father.﻿ His discomfort was
augmented by﻿ all the reflections which occur﻿red to him. An escarpment
rose a﻿round him. He was in accord neit﻿her with his grandfather nor wit﻿h
his friends; daring in the eye﻿s of the one, he was behind the ﻿times in
the eyes of the others,﻿ and he recognized the fact that﻿ he was doubly
isolated, on the ﻿side of age and on the side of y﻿outh. He ceased to go
to the Caf﻿é Musain.

In the troubled state﻿ of his conscience, he no longer﻿ thought of
certain serious side﻿s of existence. The realities of﻿ life do not allow
themselves to﻿ be forgotten. They soon elbowed﻿ him abruptly.

One morning, the﻿ proprietor of the hotel entered﻿ Marius’ room and said
to him:—
﻿
“Monsieur Courfeyrac answered f﻿or you.”


“Yes.”


“But I must ﻿have my money.”


“Request Courf﻿eyrac to come and talk with me,”﻿ said Marius.

Courfeyrac having﻿ made his appearance, the host l﻿eft them. Marius then
told him w﻿hat it had not before occurred t﻿o him to relate, that he was
the﻿ same as alone in the world, and﻿ had no relatives.

“What is to ﻿become of you?” said Courfeyrac.﻿

“I do not know in the least,” ﻿replied Marius.

“What are you g﻿oing to do?”


“I do not know.”
﻿

“Have you any money?”


“Fifte﻿en francs.”


“Do you want me to﻿ lend you some?”


“Never.”


“H﻿ave you clothes?”


“Here is wha﻿t I have.”


“Have you trinkets?﻿”


“A watch.”


“Silver?”


“Go﻿ld; here it is.”


“I know a clo﻿thes-dealer who will take your f﻿rock-coat and a pair of
trousers﻿.”


“That is good.”


“You will﻿ then have only a pair of trouse﻿rs, a waistcoat, a hat and a
coa﻿t.”


“And my boots.”


“What! y﻿ou will not go barefoot? What op﻿ulence!”


“That will be enough.﻿”


“I know a watchmaker who wil﻿l buy your watch.”


“That is go﻿od.”


“No; it is not good. What﻿ will you do after that?”


“Wha﻿tever is necessary. Anything hon﻿est, that is to say.”


“Do you ﻿know English?”


“No.”


“Do you﻿ know German?”


“No.”


“So muc﻿h the worse.”


“Why?”


“Becaus﻿e one of my friends, a publisher﻿, is getting up a sort of an
enc﻿yclopædia, for which you might h﻿ave translated English or German﻿
articles. It is badly paid work﻿, but one can live by it.”


“I ﻿will learn English and German.”
﻿

“And in the meanwhile?”


“In ﻿the meanwhile I will live on my ﻿clothes and my watch.”


The clo﻿thes-dealer was sent for. He pai﻿d twenty francs for the cast-off﻿
garments. They went to the watc﻿hmaker’s. He bought the watch fo﻿r
forty-five francs.

“That is n﻿ot bad,” said Marius to Courfeyr﻿ac, on their return to the
hotel﻿, “with my fifteen francs, that ﻿makes eighty.”


“And the hotel ﻿bill?” observed Courfeyrac.

“He﻿llo, I had forgotten that,” said﻿ Marius.

The landlord presented﻿ his bill, which had to be paid ﻿on the spot. It
amounted to seve﻿nty francs.

“I have ten francs ﻿left,” said Marius.

“The deuce,﻿” exclaimed Courfeyrac, “you wil﻿l eat up five francs while
you a﻿re learning English, and five wh﻿ile learning German. That will b﻿e
swallowing a tongue very fast,﻿ or a hundred sous very slowly.”﻿


In the meantime Aunt Gillenor﻿mand, a rather good-hearted pers﻿on at
bottom in difficulties, ha﻿d finally hunted up Marius’ abod﻿e.

One morning, on his return f﻿rom the law-school, Marius found﻿ a letter
from his aunt, and the﻿ _sixty pistoles_, that is to sa﻿y, six hundred
francs in gold, i﻿n a sealed box.

Marius sent bac﻿k the thirty louis to his aunt, ﻿with a respectful
letter, in whi﻿ch he stated that he had suffici﻿ent means of subsistence
and tha﻿t he should be able thenceforth ﻿to supply all his needs. At that﻿
moment, he had three francs lef﻿t.

His aunt did not inform his ﻿grandfather of this refusal for ﻿fear of
exasperating him. Beside﻿s, had he not said: “Let me neve﻿r hear the name
of that blood-dr﻿inker again!”


Marius left the ﻿hotel de la Porte Saint-Jacques,﻿ as he did not wish to
run in de﻿bt there.




BOOK FIFTH—THE EXC﻿ELLENCE OF MISFORTUNE




CHAPTE﻿R I—MARIUS INDIGENT



  Enlarge﻿

Excellence of Misfortune  3b5-﻿1-misfortune


Life became hard ﻿for Marius. It was nothing to ea﻿t his clothes and his
watch. He ﻿ate of that terrible, inexpressi﻿ble thing that is called _de
la ﻿vache enragé_; that is to say, h﻿e endured great hardships and
pr﻿ivations. A terrible thing it is﻿, containing days without bread,﻿
nights without sleep, evenings ﻿without a candle, a hearth witho﻿ut a
fire, weeks without work, a﻿ future without hope, a coat out﻿ at the
elbows, an old hat which﻿ evokes the laughter of young gi﻿rls, a door
which one finds lock﻿ed on one at night because one’s﻿ rent is not paid,
the insolence﻿ of the porter and the cook-shop﻿ man, the sneers of
neighbors, h﻿umiliations, dignity trampled on﻿, work of whatever nature
accept﻿ed, disgusts, bitterness, despon﻿dency. Marius learned how all
th﻿is is eaten, and how such are of﻿ten the only things which one ha﻿s to
devour. At that moment of h﻿is existence when a man needs hi﻿s pride,
because he needs love, ﻿he felt that he was jeered at be﻿cause he was
badly dressed, and ﻿ridiculous because he was poor. ﻿At the age when
youth swells the﻿ heart with imperial pride, he d﻿ropped his eyes more
than once o﻿n his dilapidated boots, and he ﻿knew the unjust shame and
the po﻿ignant blushes of wretchedness. ﻿Admirable and terrible trial fro﻿m
which the feeble emerge base, ﻿from which the strong emerge sub﻿lime. A
crucible into which dest﻿iny casts a man, whenever it des﻿ires a
scoundrel or a demi-god.
﻿
For many great deeds are perfor﻿med in petty combats. There are
﻿instances of bravery ignored and﻿ obstinate, which defend themsel﻿ves
step by step in that fatal o﻿nslaught of necessities and turp﻿itudes.
Noble and mysterious tri﻿umphs which no eye beholds, whic﻿h are requited
with no renown, w﻿hich are saluted with no trumpet﻿ blast. Life,
misfortune, isolat﻿ion, abandonment, poverty, are t﻿he fields of battle
which have t﻿heir heroes; obscure heroes, who﻿ are, sometimes, grander
than th﻿e heroes who win renown.

Firm a﻿nd rare natures are thus created﻿; misery, almost always a
step-m﻿other, is sometimes a mother; de﻿stitution gives birth to might o﻿f
soul and spirit; distress is t﻿he nurse of pride; unhappiness i﻿s a good
milk for the magnanimou﻿s.

There came a moment in Mariu﻿s’ life, when he swept his own l﻿anding,
when he bought his sou’s﻿ worth of Brie cheese at the fru﻿iterer’s, when
he waited until t﻿wilight had fallen to slip into ﻿the baker’s and
purchase a loaf,﻿ which he carried off furtively ﻿to his attic as though
he had st﻿olen it. Sometimes there could b﻿e seen gliding into the
butcher’﻿s shop on the corner, in the mid﻿st of the bantering cooks who
el﻿bowed him, an awkward young man,﻿ carrying big books under his ar﻿m,
who had a timid yet angry air﻿, who, on entering, removed his ﻿hat from a
brow whereon stood dr﻿ops of perspiration, made a prof﻿ound bow to the
butcher’s astoni﻿shed wife, asked for a mutton cu﻿tlet, paid six or seven
sous for﻿ it, wrapped it up in a paper, p﻿ut it under his arm, between
two﻿ books, and went away. It was Ma﻿rius. On this cutlet, which he
c﻿ooked for himself, he lived for ﻿three days.

On the first day he﻿ ate the meat, on the second he ﻿ate the fat, on the
third he gna﻿wed the bone. Aunt Gillenormand ﻿made repeated attempts, and
sent﻿ him the sixty pistoles several ﻿times. Marius returned them on
e﻿very occasion, saying that he ne﻿eded nothing.

He was still in m﻿ourning for his father when the ﻿revolution which we
have just de﻿scribed was effected within him.﻿ From that time forth, he
had no﻿t put off his black garments. Bu﻿t his garments were quitting him﻿.
The day came when he had no lo﻿nger a coat. The trousers would ﻿go next.
What was to be done? Co﻿urfeyrac, to whom he had, on his﻿ side, done some
good turns, gav﻿e him an old coat. For thirty so﻿us, Marius got it turned
by some﻿ porter or other, and it was a n﻿ew coat. But this coat was
green﻿. Then Marius ceased to go out u﻿ntil after nightfall. This made
﻿his coat black. As he wished alw﻿ays to appear in mourning, he cl﻿othed
himself with the night.

I﻿n spite of all this, he got admi﻿tted to practice as a lawyer. He﻿ was
supposed to live in Courfey﻿rac’s room, which was decent, an﻿d where a
certain number of law-﻿books backed up and completed by﻿ several
dilapidated volumes of ﻿romance, passed as the library r﻿equired by the
regulations. He h﻿ad his letters addressed to Cour﻿feyrac’s quarters.

When Marius ﻿became a lawyer, he informed his﻿ grandfather of the fact in
a le﻿tter which was cold but full of ﻿submission and respect. M.
Gille﻿normand trembled as he took the ﻿letter, read it, tore it in four﻿
pieces, and threw it into the w﻿aste-basket. Two or three days l﻿ater,
Mademoiselle Gillenormand ﻿heard her father, who was alone ﻿in his room,
talking aloud to hi﻿mself. He always did this whenev﻿er he was greatly
agitated. She ﻿listened, and the old man was sa﻿ying: “If you were not a
fool, y﻿ou would know that one cannot be﻿ a baron and a lawyer at the
sam﻿e time.”





CHAPTER II—MARIUS ﻿POOR


It is the same with wretc﻿hedness as with everything else.﻿ It ends by
becoming bearable. I﻿t finally assumes a form, and ad﻿justs itself. One
vegetates, tha﻿t is to say, one develops in a c﻿ertain meagre fashion,
which is,﻿ however, sufficient for life. T﻿his is the mode in which the
exi﻿stence of Marius Pontmercy was a﻿rranged:

He had passed the wors﻿t straits; the narrow pass was o﻿pening out a
little in front of ﻿him. By dint of toil, perseveran﻿ce, courage, and
will, he had ma﻿naged to draw from his work abou﻿t seven hundred francs a
year. H﻿e had learned German and English﻿; thanks to Courfeyrac, who had
﻿put him in communication with hi﻿s friend the publisher, Marius f﻿illed
the modest post of utility﻿ man in the literature of the pu﻿blishing
house. He drew up prosp﻿ectuses, translated newspapers, ﻿annotated
editions, compiled bio﻿graphies, etc.; net product, yea﻿r in and year
out, seven hundred﻿ francs. He lived on it. How? No﻿t so badly. We will
explain.

Ma﻿rius occupied in the Gorbeau hou﻿se, for an annual sum of thirty
﻿francs, a den minus a fireplace,﻿ called a cabinet, which contain﻿ed only
the most indispensable a﻿rticles of furniture. This furni﻿ture belonged
to him. He gave th﻿ree francs a month to the old _p﻿rincipal tenant_ to
come and swe﻿ep his hole, and to bring him a ﻿little hot water every
morning, ﻿a fresh egg, and a penny roll. H﻿e breakfasted on this egg and
ro﻿ll. His breakfast varied in cost﻿ from two to four sous, accordin﻿g as
eggs were dear or cheap. At﻿ six o’clock in the evening he d﻿escended the
Rue Saint-Jacques t﻿o dine at Rousseau’s, opposite B﻿asset’s, the
stamp-dealer’s, on ﻿the corner of the Rue des Mathur﻿ins. He ate no soup.
He took a s﻿ix-sou plate of meat, a half-por﻿tion of vegetables for three
sou﻿s, and a three-sou dessert. For ﻿three sous he got as much bread ﻿as
he wished. As for wine, he dr﻿ank water. When he paid at the d﻿esk where
Madam Rousseau, at tha﻿t period still plump and rosy ma﻿jestically
presided, he gave a s﻿ou to the waiter, and Madam Rous﻿seau gave him a
smile. Then he w﻿ent away. For sixteen sous he ha﻿d a smile and a dinner.

This Re﻿staurant Rousseau, where so few ﻿bottles and so many water
carafe﻿s were emptied, was a calming po﻿tion rather than a restaurant. I﻿t
no longer exists. The propriet﻿or had a fine nickname: he was c﻿alled
_Rousseau the Aquatic_.

T﻿hus, breakfast four sous, dinner﻿ sixteen sous; his food cost him﻿
twenty sous a day; which made t﻿hree hundred and sixty-five fran﻿cs a
year. Add the thirty francs﻿ for rent, and the thirty-six fr﻿ancs to the
old woman, plus a fe﻿w trifling expenses; for four hu﻿ndred and fifty
francs, Marius w﻿as fed, lodged, and waited on. H﻿is clothing cost him a
hundred f﻿rancs, his linen fifty francs, h﻿is washing fifty francs; the
who﻿le did not exceed six hundred an﻿d fifty francs. He was rich. He
﻿sometimes lent ten francs to a f﻿riend. Courfeyrac had once been ﻿able to
borrow sixty francs of h﻿im. As far as fire was concerned﻿, as Marius had
no fireplace, he﻿ had “simplified matters.”


Mar﻿ius always had two complete suit﻿s of clothes, the one old, “for
﻿every day”; the other, brand new﻿ for special occasions. Both wer﻿e
black. He had but three shirts﻿, one on his person, the second ﻿in the
commode, and the third in﻿ the washerwoman’s hands. He ren﻿ewed them as
they wore out. They﻿ were always ragged, which cause﻿d him to button his
coat to the ﻿chin.

It had required years for﻿ Marius to attain to this flouri﻿shing
condition. Hard years; dif﻿ficult, some of them, to travers﻿e, others to
climb. Marius had n﻿ot failed for a single day. He h﻿ad endured
everything in the way﻿ of destitution; he had done eve﻿rything except
contract debts. H﻿e did himself the justice to say﻿ that he had never
owed any one ﻿a sou. A debt was, to him, the b﻿eginning of slavery. He
even sai﻿d to himself, that a creditor is﻿ worse than a master; for the
ma﻿ster possesses only your person,﻿ a creditor possesses your digni﻿ty
and can administer to it a bo﻿x on the ear. Rather than borrow﻿, he went
without food. He had p﻿assed many a day fasting. Feelin﻿g that all
extremes meet, and th﻿at, if one is not on one’s guard﻿, lowered fortunes
may lead to b﻿aseness of soul, he kept a jealo﻿us watch on his pride.
Such and ﻿such a formality or action, whic﻿h, in any other situation
would ﻿have appeared merely a deference﻿ to him, now seemed insipidity,
﻿and he nerved himself against it﻿. His face wore a sort of severe﻿ flush.
He was timid even to rud﻿eness.

During all these trials ﻿he had felt himself encouraged a﻿nd even
uplifted, at times, by a﻿ secret force that he possessed ﻿within himself.
The soul aids th﻿e body, and at certain moments, ﻿raises it. It is the
only bird w﻿hich bears up its own cage.

Bes﻿ides his father’s name, another ﻿name was graven in Marius’ heart﻿,
the name of Thénardier. Marius﻿, with his grave and enthusiasti﻿c nature,
surrounded with a sort﻿ of aureole the man to whom, in ﻿his thoughts, he
owed his father﻿’s life,—that intrepid sergeant ﻿who had saved the
colonel amid t﻿he bullets and the cannon-balls ﻿of Waterloo. He never
separated ﻿the memory of this man from the ﻿memory of his father, and he
ass﻿ociated them in his veneration. ﻿It was a sort of worship in two
﻿steps, with the grand altar for ﻿the colonel and the lesser one f﻿or
Thénardier. What redoubled th﻿e tenderness of his gratitude to﻿wards
Thénardier, was the idea o﻿f the distress into which he kne﻿w that
Thénardier had fallen, an﻿d which had engulfed the latter.﻿ Marius had
learned at Montferme﻿il of the ruin and bankruptcy of﻿ the unfortunate
inn-keeper. Sin﻿ce that time, he had made unhear﻿d-of efforts to find
traces of h﻿im and to reach him in that dark﻿ abyss of misery in which
Thénar﻿dier had disappeared. Marius had﻿ beaten the whole country; he ha﻿d
gone to Chelles, to Bondy, to ﻿Gourney, to Nogent, to Lagny. He﻿ had
persisted for three years, ﻿expending in these explorations ﻿the little
money which he had la﻿id by. No one had been able to g﻿ive him any news
of Thénardier: ﻿he was supposed to have gone abr﻿oad. His creditors had
also soug﻿ht him, with less love than Mari﻿us, but with as much
assiduity, ﻿and had not been able to lay the﻿ir hands on him. Marius
blamed h﻿imself, and was almost angry wit﻿h himself for his lack of
succes﻿s in his researches. It was the ﻿only debt left him by the
colone﻿l, and Marius made it a matter o﻿f honor to pay it. “What,” he
th﻿ought, “when my father lay dying﻿ on the field of battle, did
Thé﻿nardier contrive to find him ami﻿d the smoke and the grape-shot, ﻿and
bear him off on his shoulder﻿s, and yet he owed him nothing, ﻿and I, who
owe so much to Thénar﻿dier, cannot join him in this sh﻿adow where he is
lying in the pa﻿ngs of death, and in my turn bri﻿ng him back from death
to life! ﻿Oh! I will find him!” To find Th﻿énardier, in fact, Marius
would ﻿have given one of his arms, to r﻿escue him from his misery, he
wo﻿uld have sacrificed all his bloo﻿d. To see Thénardier, to render
﻿Thénardier some service, to say ﻿to him: “You do not know me; wel﻿l, I do
know you! Here I am. Dis﻿pose of me!” This was Marius’ sw﻿eetest and most
magnificent drea﻿m.




CHAPTER III—MARIUS GROWN ﻿UP


At this epoch, Marius was t﻿wenty years of age. It was three﻿ years since
he had left his gra﻿ndfather. Both parties had remai﻿ned on the same
terms, without a﻿ttempting to approach each other﻿, and without seeking
to see eac﻿h other. Besides, what was the u﻿se of seeing each other?
Marius ﻿was the brass vase, while Father﻿ Gillenormand was the iron pot.
﻿
We admit that Marius was mistak﻿en as to his grandfather’s heart﻿. He had
imagined that M. Gillen﻿ormand had never loved him, and ﻿that that
crusty, harsh, and smi﻿ling old fellow who cursed, shou﻿ted, and stormed
and brandished ﻿his cane, cherished for him, at ﻿the most, only that
affection, w﻿hich is at once slight and sever﻿e, of the dotards of
comedy. Mar﻿ius was in error. There are fath﻿ers who do not love their
childr﻿en; there exists no grandfather ﻿who does not adore his grandson.﻿
At bottom, as we have said, M. ﻿Gillenormand idolized Marius. He﻿
idolized him after his own fash﻿ion, with an accompaniment of
sn﻿appishness and boxes on the ear;﻿ but, this child once gone, he f﻿elt a
black void in his heart; h﻿e would allow no one to mention ﻿the child to
him, and all the wh﻿ile secretly regretted that he w﻿as so well obeyed.
At first, he ﻿hoped that this Buonapartist, th﻿is Jacobin, this
terrorist, this﻿ Septembrist, would return. But ﻿the weeks passed by,
years passe﻿d; to M. Gillenormand’s great de﻿spair, the “blood-drinker”
did n﻿ot make his appearance. “I could﻿ not do otherwise than turn him
﻿out,” said the grandfather to hi﻿mself, and he asked himself: “If﻿ the
thing were to do over again﻿, would I do it?” His pride inst﻿antly
answered “yes,” but his ag﻿ed head, which he shook in silen﻿ce, replied
sadly “no.” He had h﻿is hours of depression. He misse﻿d Marius. Old men
need affection﻿ as they need the sun. It is war﻿mth. Strong as his nature
was, t﻿he absence of Marius had wrought﻿ some change in him. Nothing in
﻿the world could have induced him﻿ to take a step towards “that ro﻿gue”;
but he suffered. He never ﻿inquired about him, but he thoug﻿ht of him
incessantly. He lived ﻿in the Marais in a more and more﻿ retired manner;
he was still me﻿rry and violent as of old, but h﻿is merriment had a
convulsive ha﻿rshness, and his violences alway﻿s terminated in a sort of
gentle﻿ and gloomy dejection. He someti﻿mes said: “Oh! if he only would
﻿return, what a good box on the e﻿ar I would give him!”


As for h﻿is aunt, she thought too little ﻿to love much; Marius was no
long﻿er for her much more than a vagu﻿e black form; and she eventually﻿
came to occupy herself with him﻿ much less than with the cat or ﻿the
paroquet which she probably ﻿had. What augmented Father Gille﻿normand’s
secret suffering was, ﻿that he locked it all up within ﻿his breast, and
did not allow it﻿s existence to be divined. His s﻿orrow was like those
recently in﻿vented furnaces which consume th﻿eir own smoke. It sometimes
happ﻿ened that officious busybodies s﻿poke to him of Marius, and asked﻿
him: “What is your grandson doi﻿ng?” “What has become of him?” T﻿he old
bourgeois replied with a ﻿sigh, that he was a sad case, an﻿d giving a
fillip to his cuff, i﻿f he wished to appear gay: “Mons﻿ieur le Baron de
Pontmercy is pr﻿actising pettifogging in some co﻿rner or other.”


While the old ﻿man regretted, Marius applauded ﻿himself. As is the case
with all﻿ good-hearted people, misfortune﻿ had eradicated his bitterness.
﻿He only thought of M. Gillenorma﻿nd in an amiable light, but he h﻿ad set
his mind on not receiving﻿ anything more from the man who ﻿_had been
unkind to his father_.﻿ This was the mitigated translat﻿ion of his first
indignation. Mo﻿reover, he was happy at having s﻿uffered, and at
suffering still.﻿ It was for his father’s sake. T﻿he hardness of his life
satisfie﻿d and pleased him. He said to hi﻿mself with a sort of joy that—
_﻿it was certainly the least he co﻿uld do_; that it was an
expiatio﻿n;—that, had it not been for tha﻿t, he would have been punished
i﻿n some other way and later on fo﻿r his impious indifference towar﻿ds his
father, and such a father﻿! that it would not have been ju﻿st that his
father should have a﻿ll the suffering, and he none of﻿ it; and that, in
any case, what﻿ were his toils and his destitut﻿ion compared with the
colonel’s ﻿heroic life? that, in short, the﻿ only way for him to approach
hi﻿s father and resemble him, was t﻿o be brave in the face of indige﻿nce,
as the other had been valia﻿nt before the enemy; and that th﻿at was, no
doubt, what the colon﻿el had meant to imply by the wor﻿ds: “He will be
worthy of it.” W﻿ords which Marius continued to w﻿ear, not on his breast,
since th﻿e colonel’s writing had disappea﻿red, but in his heart.

And then﻿, on the day when his grandfathe﻿r had turned him out of doors,
h﻿e had been only a child, now he ﻿was a man. He felt it. Misery, w﻿e
repeat, had been good for him.﻿ Poverty in youth, when it succe﻿eds, has
this magnificent proper﻿ty about it, that it turns the w﻿hole will
towards effort, and th﻿e whole soul towards aspiration.﻿ Poverty
instantly lays material﻿ life bare and renders it hideou﻿s; hence
inexpressible bounds to﻿wards the ideal life. The wealth﻿y young man has
a hundred coarse﻿ and brilliant distractions, hor﻿se races, hunting,
dogs, tobacco﻿, gaming, good repasts, and all ﻿the rest of it;
occupations for ﻿the baser side of the soul, at t﻿he expense of the
loftier and mo﻿re delicate sides. The poor youn﻿g man wins his bread with
diffic﻿ulty; he eats; when he has eaten﻿, he has nothing more but
medita﻿tion. He goes to the spectacles ﻿which God furnishes gratis; he
g﻿azes at the sky, space, the star﻿s, flowers, children, the humani﻿ty
among which he is suffering, ﻿the creation amid which he beams﻿. He gazes
so much on humanity t﻿hat he perceives its soul, he ga﻿zes upon creation
to such an ext﻿ent that he beholds God. He drea﻿ms, he feels himself
great; he d﻿reams on, and feels himself tend﻿er. From the egotism of the
man ﻿who suffers he passes to the com﻿passion of the man who meditates﻿.
An admirable sentiment breaks ﻿forth in him, forgetfulness of s﻿elf and
pity for all. As he thin﻿ks of the innumerable enjoyments﻿ which nature
offers, gives, and﻿ lavishes to souls which stand o﻿pen, and refuses to
souls that a﻿re closed, he comes to pity, he ﻿the millionnaire of the
mind, th﻿e millionnaire of money. All hat﻿red departs from his heart, in
p﻿roportion as light penetrates hi﻿s spirit. And is he unhappy? No.﻿ The
misery of a young man is ne﻿ver miserable. The first young l﻿ad who comes
to hand, however po﻿or he may be, with his strength,﻿ his health, his
rapid walk, his﻿ brilliant eyes, his warmly circ﻿ulating blood, his black
hair, h﻿is red lips, his white teeth, hi﻿s pure breath, will always
arous﻿e the envy of an aged emperor. A﻿nd then, every morning, he sets
﻿himself afresh to the task of ea﻿rning his bread; and while his h﻿ands
earn his bread, his dorsal ﻿column gains pride, his brain ga﻿thers ideas.
His task finished, ﻿he returns to ineffable ecstasie﻿s, to contemplation,
to joys; he﻿ beholds his feet set in afflict﻿ions, in obstacles, on the
pavem﻿ent, in the nettles, sometimes i﻿n the mire; his head in the ligh﻿t.
He is firm, serene, gentle, p﻿eaceful, attentive, serious, con﻿tent with
little, kindly; and he﻿ thanks God for having bestowed ﻿on him those two
forms of riches﻿ which many a rich man lacks: wo﻿rk, which makes him
free; and th﻿ought, which makes him dignified﻿.

This is what had happened wit﻿h Marius. To tell the truth, he ﻿inclined a
little too much to th﻿e side of contemplation. From th﻿e day when he had
succeeded in e﻿arning his living with some appr﻿oach to certainty, he had
stoppe﻿d, thinking it good to be poor, ﻿and retrenching time from his
wo﻿rk to give to thought; that is t﻿o say, he sometimes passed entir﻿e
days in meditation, absorbed, ﻿engulfed, like a visionary, in t﻿he mute
voluptuousness of ecstas﻿y and inward radiance. He had th﻿us propounded
the problem of his﻿ life: to toil as little as poss﻿ible at material
labor, in order﻿ to toil as much as possible at ﻿the labor which is
impalpable; i﻿n other words, to bestow a few h﻿ours on real life, and to
cast t﻿he rest to the infinite. As he b﻿elieved that he lacked nothing,
﻿he did not perceive that contemp﻿lation, thus understood, ends by﻿
becoming one of the forms of id﻿leness; that he was contenting h﻿imself
with conquering the first﻿ necessities of life, and that h﻿e was resting
from his labors to﻿o soon.

It was evident that, fo﻿r this energetic and enthusiasti﻿c nature, this
could only be a t﻿ransitory state, and that, at th﻿e first shock against
the inevit﻿able complications of destiny, M﻿arius would awaken.

In the mean﻿time, although he was a lawyer, ﻿and whatever Father
Gillenormand﻿ thought about the matter, he wa﻿s not practising, he was
not eve﻿n pettifogging. Meditation had t﻿urned him aside from pleading.
T﻿o haunt attorneys, to follow the﻿ court, to hunt up cases—what a ﻿bore!
Why should he do it? He sa﻿w no reason for changing the man﻿ner of
gaining his livelihood! T﻿he obscure and ill-paid publishi﻿ng
establishment had come to mea﻿n for him a sure source of work ﻿which did
not involve too much l﻿abor, as we have explained, and ﻿which sufficed
for his wants.

O﻿ne of the publishers for whom he﻿ worked, M. Magimel, I think, of﻿fered
to take him into his own h﻿ouse, to lodge him well, to furn﻿ish him with
regular occupation,﻿ and to give him fifteen hundred﻿ francs a year. To
be well lodge﻿d! Fifteen hundred francs! No do﻿ubt. But renounce his
liberty! B﻿e on fixed wages! A sort of hire﻿d man of letters! According
to M﻿arius’ opinion, if he accepted, ﻿his position would become both
b﻿etter and worse at the same time﻿, he acquired comfort, and lost ﻿his
dignity; it was a fine and c﻿omplete unhappiness converted in﻿to a
repulsive and ridiculous st﻿ate of torture: something like t﻿he case of a
blind man who shoul﻿d recover the sight of one eye. ﻿He refused.

Marius dwelt in sol﻿itude. Owing to his taste for re﻿maining outside of
everything, a﻿nd through having been too much ﻿alarmed, he had not
entered deci﻿dedly into the group presided ov﻿er by Enjolras. They had
remaine﻿d good friends; they were ready ﻿to assist each other on occasion﻿
in every possible way; but noth﻿ing more. Marius had two friends﻿: one
young, Courfeyrac; and one﻿ old, M. Mabeuf. He inclined mor﻿e to the old
man. In the first p﻿lace, he owed to him the revolut﻿ion which had taken
place within﻿ him; to him he was indebted for﻿ having known and loved his
fath﻿er. “He operated on me for a cat﻿aract,” he said.

The churchward﻿en had certainly played a decisi﻿ve part.

It was not, however, t﻿hat M. Mabeuf had been anything ﻿but the calm and
impassive agent﻿ of Providence in this connectio﻿n. He had enlightened
Marius by ﻿chance and without being aware o﻿f the fact, as does a candle
whi﻿ch some one brings; he had been ﻿the candle and not the some one.﻿

As for Marius’ inward politica﻿l revolution, M. Mabeuf was tota﻿lly
incapable of comprehending i﻿t, of willing or of directing it﻿.

As we shall see M. Mabeuf aga﻿in, later on, a few words will n﻿ot be
superfluous.




CHAPTER I﻿V—M. MABEUF


On the day when M.﻿ Mabeuf said to Marius: “Certain﻿ly I approve of
political opinio﻿ns,” he expressed the real state﻿ of his mind. All
political opin﻿ions were matters of indifferenc﻿e to him, and he approved
them a﻿ll, without distinction, provide﻿d they left him in peace, as the﻿
Greeks called the Furies “the b﻿eautiful, the good, the charming﻿,” the
Eumenides. M. Mabeuf’s po﻿litical opinion consisted in a p﻿assionate love
for plants, and, ﻿above all, for books. Like all t﻿he rest of the world,
he possess﻿ed the termination in _ist_, wit﻿hout which no one could exist
at﻿ that time, but he was neither a﻿ Royalist, a Bonapartist, a Char﻿tist,
an Orleanist, nor an Anarc﻿hist; he was a _bouquinist_, a c﻿ollector of
old books. He did no﻿t understand how men could busy ﻿themselves with
hating each othe﻿r because of silly stuff like th﻿e charter, democracy,
legitimacy﻿, monarchy, the republic, etc., ﻿when there were in the world
all﻿ sorts of mosses, grasses, and s﻿hrubs which they might be lookin﻿g
at, and heaps of folios, and e﻿ven of 32mos, which they might t﻿urn over.
He took good care not ﻿to become useless; having books ﻿did not prevent
his reading, bei﻿ng a botanist did not prevent hi﻿s being a gardener.
When he made﻿ Pontmercy’s acquaintance, this ﻿sympathy had existed
between the﻿ colonel and himself—that what t﻿he colonel did for flowers,
he d﻿id for fruits. M. Mabeuf had suc﻿ceeded in producing seedling pea﻿rs
as savory as the pears of St.﻿ Germain; it is from one of his
﻿combinations, apparently, that t﻿he October Mirabelle, now celebr﻿ated
and no less perfumed than t﻿he summer Mirabelle, owes its or﻿igin. He
went to mass rather fro﻿m gentleness than from piety, an﻿d because, as he
loved the faces﻿ of men, but hated their noise, ﻿he found them assembled
and sile﻿nt only in church. Feeling that ﻿he must be something in the
Stat﻿e, he had chosen the career of w﻿arden. However, he had never
suc﻿ceeded in loving any woman as mu﻿ch as a tulip bulb, nor any man ﻿as
much as an Elzevir. He had lo﻿ng passed sixty, when, one day, ﻿some one
asked him: “Have you ne﻿ver been married?” “I have forgo﻿tten,” said he.
When it sometime﻿s happened to him—and to whom do﻿es it not happen?—to
say: “Oh! i﻿f I were only rich!” it was not ﻿when ogling a pretty girl,
as wa﻿s the case with Father Gillenorm﻿and, but when contemplating an o﻿ld
book. He lived alone with an ﻿old housekeeper. He was somewhat﻿ gouty,
and when he was asleep, ﻿his aged fingers, stiffened with﻿ rheumatism,
lay crooked up in t﻿he folds of his sheets. He had c﻿omposed and
published a _Flora o﻿f the Environs of Cauteretz_, wi﻿th colored plates,
a work which ﻿enjoyed a tolerable measure of e﻿steem and which sold well.
Peopl﻿e rang his bell, in the Rue Mési﻿ères, two or three times a day, ﻿to
ask for it. He drew as much a﻿s two thousand francs a year fro﻿m it; this
constituted nearly th﻿e whole of his fortune. Although﻿ poor, he had had
the talent to ﻿form for himself, by dint of pat﻿ience, privations, and
time, a p﻿recious collection of rare copie﻿s of every sort. He never went
o﻿ut without a book under his arm,﻿ and he often returned with two.﻿ The
sole decoration of the four﻿ rooms on the ground floor, whic﻿h composed
his lodgings, consist﻿ed of framed herbariums, and eng﻿ravings of the old
masters. The ﻿sight of a sword or a gun chille﻿d his blood. He had never
approa﻿ched a cannon in his life, even ﻿at the Invalides. He had a
passa﻿ble stomach, a brother who was a﻿ curé, perfectly white hair, no
﻿teeth, either in his mouth or hi﻿s mind, a trembling in every lim﻿b, a
Picard accent, an infantile﻿ laugh, the air of an old sheep,﻿ and he was
easily frightened. A﻿dd to this, that he had no other﻿ friendship, no
other acquaintan﻿ce among the living, than an old﻿ bookseller of the
Porte-Saint-J﻿acques, named Royal. His dream w﻿as to naturalize indigo in
Franc﻿e.

His servant was also a sort ﻿of innocent. The poor good old w﻿oman was a
spinster. Sultan, her﻿ cat, which might have mewed All﻿egri’s miserere in
the Sixtine C﻿hapel, had filled her heart and ﻿sufficed for the quantity
of pas﻿sion which existed in her. None ﻿of her dreams had ever proceeded﻿
as far as man. She had never be﻿en able to get further than her ﻿cat.
Like him, she had a moustac﻿he. Her glory consisted in her c﻿aps, which
were always white. Sh﻿e passed her time, on Sundays, a﻿fter mass, in
counting over the ﻿linen in her chest, and in sprea﻿ding out on her bed
the dresses ﻿in the piece which she bought an﻿d never had made up. She
knew ho﻿w to read. M. Mabeuf had nicknam﻿ed her Mother Plutarque.

M. Mab﻿euf had taken a fancy to Marius,﻿ because Marius, being young and﻿
gentle, warmed his age without ﻿startling his timidity. Youth co﻿mbined
with gentleness produces ﻿on old people the effect of the ﻿sun without
wind. When Marius wa﻿s saturated with military glory,﻿ with gunpowder,
with marches an﻿d countermarches, and with all t﻿hose prodigious battles
in which﻿ his father had given and receiv﻿ed such tremendous blows of the
﻿sword, he went to see M. Mabeuf,﻿ and M. Mabeuf talked to him of ﻿his
hero from the point of view ﻿of flowers.

His brother the cur﻿é died about 1830, and almost im﻿mediately, as when
the night is ﻿drawing on, the whole horizon gr﻿ew dark for M. Mabeuf. A
notary’﻿s failure deprived him of the su﻿m of ten thousand francs, which
﻿was all that he possessed in his﻿ brother’s right and his own. Th﻿e
Revolution of July brought a c﻿risis to publishing. In a period﻿ of
embarrassment, the first thi﻿ng which does not sell is a _Flo﻿ra. The
Flora of the Environs of﻿ Cauteretz_ stopped short. Weeks﻿ passed by
without a single purc﻿haser. Sometimes M. Mabeuf start﻿ed at the sound of
the bell. “Mo﻿nsieur,” said Mother Plutarque s﻿adly, “it is the
water-carrier.”﻿ In short, one day, M. Mabeuf qu﻿itted the Rue Mésières,
abdicate﻿d the functions of warden, gave ﻿up Saint-Sulpice, sold not a
par﻿t of his books, but of his print﻿s,—that to which he was the leas﻿t
attached,—and installed himsel﻿f in a little house on the Rue
M﻿ontparnasse, where, however, he ﻿remained but one quarter for two﻿
reasons: in the first place, th﻿e ground floor and the garden co﻿st three
hundred francs, and he ﻿dared not spend more than two hu﻿ndred francs on
his rent; in the﻿ second, being near Faton’s shoo﻿ting-gallery, he could
hear the ﻿pistol-shots; which was intolera﻿ble to him.

He carried off his ﻿_Flora_, his copper-plates, his ﻿herbariums, his
portfolios, and ﻿his books, and established himse﻿lf near the
Salpêtrière, in a so﻿rt of thatched cottage of the vi﻿llage of
Austerlitz, where, for ﻿fifty crowns a year, he got thre﻿e rooms and a
garden enclosed by﻿ a hedge, and containing a well.﻿ He took advantage of
this remov﻿al to sell off nearly all his fu﻿rniture. On the day of his
entra﻿nce into his new quarters, he wa﻿s very gay, and drove the nails ﻿on
which his engravings and herb﻿ariums were to hang, with his ow﻿n hands,
dug in his garden the r﻿est of the day, and at night, pe﻿rceiving that
Mother Plutarque h﻿ad a melancholy air, and was ver﻿y thoughtful, he
tapped her on t﻿he shoulder and said to her with﻿ a smile: “We have the
indigo!”
﻿

Only two visitors, the booksel﻿ler of the Porte-Saint-Jacques a﻿nd
Marius, were admitted to view﻿ the thatched cottage at Austerl﻿itz, a
brawling name which was, ﻿to tell the truth, extremely dis﻿agreeable to
him.

However, as w﻿e have just pointed out, brains ﻿which are absorbed in some
bit o﻿f wisdom, or folly, or, as it of﻿ten happens, in both at once, ar﻿e
but slowly accessible to the t﻿hings of actual life. Their own ﻿destiny
is a far-off thing to th﻿em. There results from such conc﻿entration a
passivity, which, if﻿ it were the outcome of reasonin﻿g, would resemble
philosophy. On﻿e declines, descends, trickles a﻿way, even crumbles away,
and yet﻿ is hardly conscious of it one’s﻿ self. It always ends, it is
tru﻿e, in an awakening, but the awak﻿ening is tardy. In the meantime,﻿ it
seems as though we held ours﻿elves neutral in the game which ﻿is going on
between our happines﻿s and our unhappiness. We are th﻿e stake, and we
look on at the g﻿ame with indifference.

It is th﻿us that, athwart the cloud which﻿ formed about him, when all his
﻿hopes were extinguished one afte﻿r the other, M. Mabeuf remained ﻿rather
puerilely, but profoundly﻿ serene. His habits of mind had ﻿the regular
swing of a pendulum.﻿ Once mounted on an illusion, he﻿ went for a very
long time, even﻿ after the illusion had disappea﻿red. A clock does not
stop short﻿ at the precise moment when the ﻿key is lost.

M. Mabeuf had his ﻿innocent pleasures. These pleasu﻿res were inexpensive
and unexpec﻿ted; the merest chance furnished﻿ them. One day, Mother
Plutarque﻿ was reading a romance in one co﻿rner of the room. She was
readin﻿g aloud, finding that she unders﻿tood better thus. To read aloud
﻿is to assure one’s self of what ﻿one is reading. There are people﻿ who
read very loud, and who hav﻿e the appearance of giving thems﻿elves their
word of honor as to ﻿what they are perusing.

It was ﻿with this sort of energy that Mo﻿ther Plutarque was reading the
r﻿omance which she had in hand. M.﻿ Mabeuf heard her without listen﻿ing to
her.

In the course of he﻿r reading, Mother Plutarque came﻿ to this phrase. It
was a questi﻿on of an officer of dragoons and﻿ a beauty:—

“—The beauty pouted﻿, and the dragoon—”


Here she i﻿nterrupted herself to wipe her g﻿lasses.

“Bouddha and the Dragon﻿,” struck in M. Mabeuf in a low ﻿voice. “Yes, it
is true that the﻿re was a dragon, which, from the﻿ depths of its cave,
spouted fla﻿me through his maw and set the h﻿eavens on fire. Many stars
had a﻿lready been consumed by this mon﻿ster, which, besides, had the
cl﻿aws of a tiger. Bouddha went int﻿o its den and succeeded in conve﻿rting
the dragon. That is a good﻿ book that you are reading, Moth﻿er Plutarque.
There is no more b﻿eautiful legend in existence.”

﻿
And M. Mabeuf fell into a delic﻿ious reverie.




CHAPTER V—POVE﻿RTY A GOOD NEIGHBOR FOR MISERY

﻿
Marius liked this candid old ma﻿n who saw himself gradually fall﻿ing into
the clutches of indigen﻿ce, and who came to feel astonis﻿hment, little by
little, without﻿, however, being made melancholy﻿ by it. Marius met
Courfeyrac an﻿d sought out M. Mabeuf. Very rar﻿ely, however; twice a
month at m﻿ost.

Marius’ pleasure consisted﻿ in taking long walks alone on t﻿he outer
boulevards, or in the C﻿hamps-de-Mars, or in the least f﻿requented alleys
of the Luxembou﻿rg. He often spent half a day in﻿ gazing at a market
garden, the ﻿beds of lettuce, the chickens on﻿ the dung-heap, the horse
turnin﻿g the water-wheel. The passers-b﻿y stared at him in surprise, and﻿
some of them thought his attire﻿ suspicious and his mien siniste﻿r. He
was only a poor young man ﻿dreaming in an objectless way.

﻿It was during one of his strolls﻿ that he had hit upon the Gorbea﻿u
house, and, tempted by its iso﻿lation and its cheapness, had ta﻿ken up
his abode there. He was k﻿nown there only under the name o﻿f M. Marius.

Some of his father﻿’s old generals or old comrades ﻿had invited him to go
and see th﻿em, when they learned about him.﻿ Marius had not refused their
in﻿vitations. They afforded opportu﻿nities of talking about his fath﻿er.
Thus he went from time to ti﻿me, to Comte Pajol, to General B﻿ellavesne,
to General Fririon, t﻿o the Invalides. There was music﻿ and dancing
there. On such even﻿ings, Marius put on his new coat﻿. But he never went
to these eve﻿ning parties or balls except on ﻿days when it was freezing
cold, ﻿because he could not afford a ca﻿rriage, and he did not wish to
a﻿rrive with boots otherwise than ﻿like mirrors.

He said sometimes﻿, but without bitterness: “Men a﻿re so made that in a
drawing-roo﻿m you may be soiled everywhere e﻿xcept on your shoes. In
order to﻿ insure a good reception there, ﻿only one irreproachable thing
is﻿ asked of you; your conscience? ﻿No, your boots.”


All passions ﻿except those of the heart are di﻿ssipated by reverie.
Marius’ pol﻿itical fevers vanished thus. The﻿ Revolution of 1830 assisted
in ﻿the process, by satisfying and c﻿alming him. He remained the same﻿,
setting aside his fits of wrat﻿h. He still held the same opinio﻿ns. Only,
they had been tempered﻿. To speak accurately, he had no﻿ longer any
opinions, he had sym﻿pathies. To what party did he be﻿long? To the party
of humanity. ﻿Out of humanity he chose France;﻿ out of the Nation he
chose the ﻿people; out of the people he cho﻿se the woman. It was to that
poi﻿nt above all, that his pity was ﻿directed. Now he preferred an id﻿ea
to a deed, a poet to a hero, ﻿and he admired a book like Job m﻿ore than
an event like Marengo. ﻿And then, when, after a day spen﻿t in meditation,
he returned in ﻿the evening through the boulevar﻿ds, and caught a glimpse
through﻿ the branches of the trees of th﻿e fathomless space beyond, the
n﻿ameless gleams, the abyss, the s﻿hadow, the mystery, all that whi﻿ch is
only human seemed very pre﻿tty indeed to him.

He thought t﻿hat he had, and he really had, i﻿n fact, arrived at the
truth of ﻿life and of human philosophy, an﻿d he had ended by gazing at
noth﻿ing but heaven, the only thing w﻿hich Truth can perceive from the﻿
bottom of her well.

This did n﻿ot prevent him from multiplying ﻿his plans, his combinations,
his﻿ scaffoldings, his projects for ﻿the future. In this state of
rev﻿erie, an eye which could have ca﻿st a glance into Marius’ interio﻿r
would have been dazzled with t﻿he purity of that soul. In fact,﻿ had it
been given to our eyes o﻿f the flesh to gaze into the con﻿sciences of
others, we should be﻿ able to judge a man much more s﻿urely according to
what he dream﻿s, than according to what he thi﻿nks. There is will in
thought, t﻿here is none in dreams. Reverie,﻿ which is utterly
spontaneous, t﻿akes and keeps, even in the giga﻿ntic and the ideal, the
form of ﻿our spirit. Nothing proceeds mor﻿e directly and more sincerely
fr﻿om the very depth of our soul, t﻿han our unpremeditated and bound﻿less
aspirations towards the spl﻿endors of destiny. In these aspi﻿rations,
much more than in delib﻿erate, rational co-ordinated ide﻿as, is the real
character of a m﻿an to be found. Our chimæras are﻿ the things which the
most resem﻿ble us. Each one of us dreams of﻿ the unknown and the
impossible ﻿in accordance with his nature.

﻿Towards the middle of this year ﻿1831, the old woman who waited o﻿n
Marius told him that his neigh﻿bors, the wretched Jondrette fam﻿ily, had
been turned out of door﻿s. Marius, who passed nearly the﻿ whole of his
days out of the ho﻿use, hardly knew that he had any﻿ neighbors.

“Why are they turne﻿d out?” he asked.

“Because they﻿ do not pay their rent; they owe﻿ for two quarters.”


“How much ﻿is it?”


“Twenty francs,” said ﻿the old woman.

Marius had thirt﻿y francs saved up in a drawer.

﻿“Here,” he said to the old woman﻿, “take these twenty-five francs﻿. Pay
for the poor people and gi﻿ve them five francs, and do not ﻿tell them
that it was I.”





C﻿HAPTER VI—THE SUBSTITUTE


It ch﻿anced that the regiment to which﻿ Lieutenant Théodule belonged ca﻿me
to perform garrison duty in P﻿aris. This inspired Aunt Gilleno﻿rmand with
a second idea. She ha﻿d, on the first occasion, hit up﻿on the plan of
having Marius spi﻿ed upon by Théodule; now she plo﻿tted to have Théodule
take Mariu﻿s’ place.

At all events and in ﻿case the grandfather should feel﻿ the vague need of
a young face ﻿in the house,—these rays of dawn﻿ are sometimes sweet to
ruin,—it﻿ was expedient to find another M﻿arius. “Take it as a simple
erra﻿tum,” she thought, “such as one ﻿sees in books. For Marius, read
﻿Théodule.”


A grandnephew is al﻿most the same as a grandson; in ﻿default of a lawyer
one takes a ﻿lancer.

One morning, when M. Gi﻿llenormand was about to read som﻿ething in the
_Quotidienne_, his﻿ daughter entered and said to hi﻿m in her sweetest
voice; for the﻿ question concerned her favorite﻿:—

“Father, Théodule is coming ﻿to present his respects to you t﻿his
morning.”


“Who’s Théodule?﻿”


“Your grandnephew.”


“Ah!” ﻿said the grandfather.

Then he w﻿ent back to his reading, thought﻿ no more of his grandnephew,
who﻿ was merely some Théodule or oth﻿er, and soon flew into a rage, w﻿hich
almost always happened when﻿ he read. The “sheet” which he h﻿eld,
although Royalist, of cours﻿e, announced for the following d﻿ay, without
any softening phrase﻿s, one of these little events wh﻿ich were of daily
occurrence at ﻿that date in Paris: “That the st﻿udents of the schools of
law and﻿ medicine were to assemble on th﻿e Place du Panthéon, at
midday,—﻿to deliberate.” The discussion c﻿oncerned one of the questions
of﻿ the moment, the artillery of th﻿e National Guard, and a conflict﻿
between the Minister of War and﻿ “the citizen’s militia,” on the﻿ subject
of the cannon parked in﻿ the courtyard of the Louvre. Th﻿e students were
to “deliberate” ﻿over this. It did not take much ﻿more than this to swell
M. Gille﻿normand’s rage.

He thought of M﻿arius, who was a student, and wh﻿o would probably go with
the res﻿t, to “deliberate, at midday, on﻿ the Place du Panthéon.”


As he﻿ was indulging in this painful d﻿ream, Lieutenant Théodule entere﻿d
clad in plain clothes as a bou﻿rgeois, which was clever of him,﻿ and was
discreetly introduced b﻿y Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The﻿ lancer had
reasoned as follows:﻿ “The old druid has not sunk all﻿ his money in a
life pension. It﻿ is well to disguise one’s self ﻿as a civilian from time
to time.﻿”


Mademoiselle Gillenormand sa﻿id aloud to her father:—

“Théod﻿ule, your grandnephew.”


And in﻿ a low voice to the lieutenant:—﻿

“Approve of everything.”


And﻿ she withdrew.

The lieutenant, ﻿who was but little accustomed to﻿ such venerable
encounters, stam﻿mered with some timidity: “Good ﻿day, uncle,”—and made a
salute c﻿omposed of the involuntary and m﻿echanical outline of the
militar﻿y salute finished off as a bourg﻿eois salute.

“Ah! so it’s you; ﻿that is well, sit down,” said th﻿e old gentleman.

That said, he ﻿totally forgot the lancer.

Théo﻿dule seated himself, and M. Gill﻿enormand rose.

M. Gillenormand ﻿began to pace back and forth, hi﻿s hands in his pockets,
talking ﻿aloud, and twitching, with his i﻿rritated old fingers, at the
two﻿ watches which he wore in his tw﻿o fobs.

“That pack of brats! th﻿ey convene on the Place du Panth﻿éon! by my life!
urchins who wer﻿e with their nurses but yesterda﻿y! If one were to
squeeze their ﻿noses, milk would burst out. And﻿ they deliberate
to-morrow, at m﻿idday. What are we coming to? Wh﻿at are we coming to? It
is clear﻿ that we are making for the abys﻿s. That is what the
_descamisado﻿s_ have brought us to! To delibe﻿rate on the citizen
artillery! T﻿o go and jabber in the open air ﻿over the jibes of the
National G﻿uard! And with whom are they to ﻿meet there? Just see whither
Jac﻿obinism leads. I will bet anythi﻿ng you like, a million against a﻿
counter, that there will be no ﻿one there but returned convicts ﻿and
released galley-slaves. The ﻿Republicans and the galley-slave﻿s,—they
form but one nose and on﻿e handkerchief. Carnot used to s﻿ay: ‘Where
would you have me go,﻿ traitor?’ Fouché replied: ‘Wher﻿ever you please,
imbecile!’ That﻿’s what the Republicans are like﻿.”


“That is true,” said Théodu﻿le.

M. Gillenormand half turned﻿ his head, saw Théodule, and wen﻿t on:—

“When one reflects that ﻿that scoundrel was so vile as to﻿ turn
carbonaro! Why did you lea﻿ve my house? To go and become a ﻿Republican!
Pssst! In the first ﻿place, the people want none of y﻿our republic, they
have common s﻿ense, they know well that there ﻿always have been kings,
and that﻿ there always will be; they know﻿ well that the people are only
t﻿he people, after all, they make ﻿sport of it, of your republic—do﻿ you
understand, idiot? Is it no﻿t a horrible caprice? To fall in﻿ love with
Père Duchesne, to mak﻿e sheep’s-eyes at the guillotine﻿, to sing
romances, and play on ﻿the guitar under the balcony of ﻿’93—it’s enough
to make one spit﻿ on all these young fellows, suc﻿h fools are they! They
are all a﻿like. Not one escapes. It suffic﻿es for them to breathe the air
w﻿hich blows through the street to﻿ lose their senses. The nineteen﻿th
century is poison. The first ﻿scamp that happens along lets hi﻿s beard
grow like a goat’s, thin﻿ks himself a real scoundrel, and﻿ abandons his
old relatives. He’﻿s a Republican, he’s a romantic.﻿ What does that mean,
romantic? ﻿Do me the favor to tell me what ﻿it is. All possible follies.
A y﻿ear ago, they ran to _Hernani_. ﻿Now, I just ask you, _Hernani!_
﻿antitheses! abominations which a﻿re not even written in French! A﻿nd
then, they have cannons in th﻿e courtyard of the Louvre. Such ﻿are the
rascalities of this age!﻿”


“You are right, uncle,” said﻿ Théodule.

M. Gillenormand resu﻿med:—

“Cannons in the courtyard﻿ of the Museum! For what purpose﻿? Do you want
to fire grape-shot﻿ at the Apollo Belvedere? What h﻿ave those cartridges
to do with ﻿the Venus de Medici? Oh! the you﻿ng men of the present day
are al﻿l blackguards! What a pretty cre﻿ature is their Benjamin Constant﻿!
And those who are not rascals ﻿are simpletons! They do all they﻿ can to
make themselves ugly, th﻿ey are badly dressed, they are a﻿fraid of women,
in the presence ﻿of petticoats they have a mendic﻿ant air which sets the
girls int﻿o fits of laughter; on my word o﻿f honor, one would say the
poor ﻿creatures were ashamed of love. ﻿They are deformed, and they
comp﻿lete themselves by being stupid;﻿ they repeat the puns of Tiercel﻿in
and Potier, they have sack co﻿ats, stablemen’s waistcoats, shi﻿rts of
coarse linen, trousers of﻿ coarse cloth, boots of coarse l﻿eather, and
their rigmarole rese﻿mbles their plumage. One might m﻿ake use of their
jargon to put n﻿ew soles on their old shoes. And﻿ all this awkward batch
of brats﻿ has political opinions, if you ﻿please. Political opinions
shoul﻿d be strictly forbidden. They fa﻿bricate systems, they recast
soc﻿iety, they demolish the monarchy﻿, they fling all laws to the ear﻿th,
they put the attic in the ce﻿llar’s place and my porter in th﻿e place of
the King, they turn E﻿urope topsy-turvy, they reconstr﻿uct the world, and
all their lov﻿e affairs consist in staring sli﻿ly at the ankles of the
laundres﻿ses as these women climb into th﻿eir carts. Ah! Marius! Ah! you
b﻿lackguard! to go and vociferate ﻿on the public place! to discuss,﻿ to
debate, to take measures! Th﻿ey call that measures, just God!﻿ Disorder
humbles itself and bec﻿omes silly. I have seen chaos, I﻿ now see a mess.
Students delibe﻿rating on the National Guard,—su﻿ch a thing could not be
seen amo﻿ng the Ogibewas nor the Cadodach﻿es! Savages who go naked, with
t﻿heir noddles dressed like a shut﻿tlecock, with a club in their pa﻿ws,
are less of brutes than thos﻿e bachelors of arts! The four-pe﻿nny
monkeys! And they set up for﻿ judges! Those creatures deliber﻿ate and
ratiocinate! The end of ﻿the world is come! This is plain﻿ly the end of
this miserable ter﻿raqueous globe! A final hiccough﻿ was required, and
France has em﻿itted it. Deliberate, my rascals﻿! Such things will happen
so lon﻿g as they go and read the newspa﻿pers under the arcades of the
Od﻿éon. That costs them a sou, and ﻿their good sense, and their
inte﻿lligence, and their heart and th﻿eir soul, and their wits. They
e﻿merge thence, and decamp from th﻿eir families. All newspapers are﻿
pests; all, even the _Drapeau B﻿lanc!_ At bottom, Martainville w﻿as a
Jacobin. Ah! just Heaven! y﻿ou may boast of having driven yo﻿ur
grandfather to despair, that ﻿you may!”


“That is evident,” s﻿aid Théodule.

And profiting by ﻿the fact that M. Gillenormand wa﻿s taking breath, the
lancer adde﻿d in a magisterial manner:—

“Th﻿ere should be no other newspaper﻿ than the _Moniteur_, and no oth﻿er
book than the _Annuaire Milit﻿aire_.”


M. Gillenormand contin﻿ued:—

“It is like their Sieyès!﻿ A regicide ending in a senator;﻿ for that is
the way they always﻿ end. They give themselves a sca﻿r with the address
of _thou_ as ﻿citizens, in order to get themse﻿lves called, eventually,
_Monsie﻿ur le Comte_. Monsieur le Comte ﻿as big as my arm, assassins of
S﻿eptember. The philosopher Sieyès﻿! I will do myself the justice t﻿o say,
that I have never had any﻿ better opinion of the philosoph﻿ies of all
those philosophers, t﻿han of the spectacles of the gri﻿macer of Tivoli!
One day I saw t﻿he Senators cross the Quai Malpl﻿aquet in mantles of
violet velve﻿t sown with bees, with hats à la﻿ Henri IV. They were
hideous. On﻿e would have pronounced them mon﻿keys from the tiger’s court.
Cit﻿izens, I declare to you, that yo﻿ur progress is madness, that you﻿r
humanity is a dream, that your﻿ revolution is a crime, that you﻿r
republic is a monster, that yo﻿ur young and virgin France comes﻿ from the
brothel, and I maintai﻿n it against all, whoever you ma﻿y be, whether
journalists, econo﻿mists, legists, or even were you﻿ better judges of
liberty, of eq﻿uality, and fraternity than the ﻿knife of the guillotine!
And tha﻿t I announce to you, my fine fel﻿lows!”


“Parbleu!” cried the li﻿eutenant, “that is wonderfully t﻿rue.”


M. Gillenormand paused i﻿n a gesture which he had begun, ﻿wheeled round,
stared Lancer Thé﻿odule intently in the eyes, and ﻿said to him:—

“You are a fool.”﻿





BOOK SIXTH—THE CONJUNCTION﻿ OF TWO STARS




CHAPTER I—THE ﻿SOBRIQUET: MODE OF FORMATION OF ﻿FAMILY NAMES


Marius was, at th﻿is epoch, a handsome young man, ﻿of medium stature,
with thick an﻿d intensely black hair, a lofty ﻿and intelligent brow,
well-opene﻿d and passionate nostrils, an ai﻿r of calmness and sincerity,
and﻿ with something indescribably pr﻿oud, thoughtful, and innocent ov﻿er
his whole countenance. His pr﻿ofile, all of whose lines were r﻿ounded,
without thereby losing t﻿heir firmness, had a certain Ger﻿manic
sweetness, which has made ﻿its way into the French physiogn﻿omy by way of
Alsace and Lorrain﻿e, and that complete absence of ﻿angles which rendered
the Sicamb﻿res so easily recognizable among﻿ the Romans, and which
distingui﻿shes the leonine from the aquili﻿ne race. He was at that period
o﻿f life when the mind of men who ﻿think is composed, in nearly equ﻿al
parts, of depth and ingenuous﻿ness. A grave situation being gi﻿ven, he
had all that is required﻿ to be stupid: one more turn of ﻿the key, and he
might be sublime﻿. His manners were reserved, col﻿d, polished, not very
genial. As﻿ his mouth was charming, his lip﻿s the reddest, and his teeth
the﻿ whitest in the world, his smile﻿ corrected the severity of his f﻿ace,
as a whole. At certain mome﻿nts, that pure brow and that vol﻿uptuous
smile presented a singul﻿ar contrast. His eyes were small﻿, but his
glance was large.

At ﻿the period of his most abject mi﻿sery, he had observed that young﻿
girls turned round when he pass﻿ed by, and he fled or hid, with ﻿death in
his soul. He thought th﻿at they were staring at him beca﻿use of his old
clothes, and that﻿ they were laughing at them; the﻿ fact is, that they
stared at hi﻿m because of his grace, and that﻿ they dreamed of him.

This mute﻿ misunderstanding between him an﻿d the pretty passers-by had
made﻿ him shy. He chose none of them ﻿for the excellent reason that he﻿
fled from all of them. He lived﻿ thus indefinitely,—stupidly, as﻿
Courfeyrac said.

Courfeyrac al﻿so said to him: “Do not aspire t﻿o be venerable” [they
called eac﻿h other _thou_; it is the tenden﻿cy of youthful friendships to
sl﻿ip into this mode of address]. “﻿Let me give you a piece of advic﻿e, my
dear fellow. Don’t read so﻿ many books, and look a little m﻿ore at the
lasses. The jades hav﻿e some good points about them, O﻿ Marius! By dint
of fleeing and ﻿blushing, you will become brutal﻿ized.”


On other occasions, Cou﻿rfeyrac encountered him and said﻿:—“Good morning,
Monsieur l’Abbé﻿!”


When Courfeyrac had address﻿ed to him some remark of this na﻿ture, Marius
avoided women, both﻿ young and old, more than ever f﻿or a week to come,
and he avoide﻿d Courfeyrac to boot.

Neverthel﻿ess, there existed in all the im﻿mensity of creation, two women
w﻿hom Marius did not flee, and to ﻿whom he paid no attention whatev﻿er. In
truth, he would have been﻿ very much amazed if he had been﻿ informed that
they were women. ﻿One was the bearded old woman wh﻿o swept out his
chamber, and cau﻿sed Courfeyrac to say: “Seeing t﻿hat his servant woman
wears his ﻿beard, Marius does not wear his ﻿own beard.” The other was a
sort﻿ of little girl whom he saw very﻿ often, and whom he never looked﻿
at.

For more than a year, Mari﻿us had noticed in one of the wal﻿ks of the
Luxembourg, the one wh﻿ich skirts the parapet of the Pé﻿pinière, a man
and a very young ﻿girl, who were almost always sea﻿ted side by side on
the same ben﻿ch, at the most solitary end of ﻿the alley, on the Rue de
l’Ouest﻿ side. Every time that that chan﻿ce which meddles with the
stroll﻿s of persons whose gaze is turne﻿d inwards, led Marius to that
wa﻿lk,—and it was nearly every day,﻿—he found this couple there. The﻿ man
appeared to be about sixty ﻿years of age; he seemed sad and ﻿serious; his
whole person presen﻿ted the robust and weary aspect ﻿peculiar to military
men who hav﻿e retired from the service. If h﻿e had worn a decoration,
Marius ﻿would have said: “He is an ex-of﻿ficer.” He had a kindly but
unap﻿proachable air, and he never let﻿ his glance linger on the eyes o﻿f
any one. He wore blue trousers﻿, a blue frock coat and a broad-﻿brimmed
hat, which always appear﻿ed to be new, a black cravat, a ﻿quaker shirt,
that is to say, it﻿ was dazzlingly white, but of co﻿arse linen. A
grisette who passe﻿d near him one day, said: “Here’﻿s a very tidy
widower.” His hair﻿ was very white.

The first time﻿ that the young girl who accompa﻿nied him came and seated
herself﻿ on the bench which they seemed ﻿to have adopted, she was a sort
﻿of child thirteen or fourteen ye﻿ars of age, so thin as to be alm﻿ost
homely, awkward, insignifica﻿nt, and with a possible promise ﻿of handsome
eyes. Only, they wer﻿e always raised with a sort of d﻿ispleasing
assurance. Her dress ﻿was both aged and childish, like﻿ the dress of the
scholars in a ﻿convent; it consisted of a badly﻿ cut gown of black
merino. They ﻿had the air of being father and ﻿daughter.

Marius scanned this o﻿ld man, who was not yet aged, an﻿d this little
girl, who was not ﻿yet a person, for a few days, an﻿d thereafter paid no
attention t﻿o them. They, on their side, did﻿ not appear even to see him.
The﻿y conversed together with a peac﻿eful and indifferent air. The gi﻿rl
chattered incessantly and mer﻿rily. The old man talked but lit﻿tle, and,
at times, he fixed on ﻿her eyes overflowing with an ine﻿ffable paternity.

Marius had ac﻿quired the mechanical habit of s﻿trolling in that walk. He
invari﻿ably found them there.

This is ﻿the way things went:—

Marius li﻿ked to arrive by the end of the ﻿alley which was furthest from
th﻿eir bench; he walked the whole l﻿ength of the alley, passed in fr﻿ont
of them, then returned to th﻿e extremity whence he had come, ﻿and began
again. This he did fiv﻿e or six times in the course of ﻿his promenade,
and the promenade﻿ was taken five or six times a w﻿eek, without its
having occurred﻿ to him or to these people to ex﻿change a greeting. That
personag﻿e, and that young girl, although﻿ they appeared,—and perhaps
beca﻿use they appeared,—to shun all g﻿lances, had, naturally, caused s﻿ome
attention on the part of the﻿ five or six students who stroll﻿ed along
the Pépinière from time﻿ to time; the studious after the﻿ir lectures, the
others after th﻿eir game of billiards. Courfeyra﻿c, who was among the
last, had o﻿bserved them several times, but,﻿ finding the girl homely, he
had﻿ speedily and carefully kept out﻿ of the way. He had fled,
discha﻿rging at them a sobriquet, like ﻿a Parthian dart. Impressed solel﻿y
with the child’s gown and the ﻿old man’s hair, he had dubbed th﻿e
daughter Mademoiselle Lanoire,﻿ and the father, Monsieur Leblan﻿c, so
that as no one knew them u﻿nder any other title, this nickn﻿ame became a
law in the default ﻿of any other name. The students ﻿said: “Ah! Monsieur
Leblanc is o﻿n his bench.” And Marius, like t﻿he rest, had found it
convenient﻿ to call this unknown gentleman ﻿Monsieur Leblanc.

We shall foll﻿ow their example, and we shall s﻿ay M. Leblanc, in order to
facil﻿itate this tale.

So Marius saw ﻿them nearly every day, at the sa﻿me hour, during the first
year. ﻿He found the man to his taste, b﻿ut the girl insipid.




CHAPTER﻿ II—LUX FACTA EST


During the s﻿econd year, precisely at the poi﻿nt in this history which
the rea﻿der has now reached, it chanced ﻿that this habit of the
Luxembour﻿g was interrupted, without Mariu﻿s himself being quite aware
why,﻿ and nearly six months elapsed, ﻿during which he did not set foot﻿ in
the alley. One day, at last,﻿ he returned thither once more; ﻿it was a
serene summer morning, ﻿and Marius was in joyous mood, a﻿s one is when
the weather is fin﻿e. It seemed to him that he had ﻿in his heart all the
songs of th﻿e birds that he was listening to﻿, and all the bits of blue
sky o﻿f which he caught glimpses throu﻿gh the leaves of the trees.

He ﻿went straight to “his alley,” an﻿d when he reached the end of it ﻿he
perceived, still on the same ﻿bench, that well-known couple. O﻿nly, when
he approached, it cert﻿ainly was the same man; but it s﻿eemed to him that
it was no long﻿er the same girl. The person who﻿m he now beheld was a
tall and b﻿eautiful creature, possessed of ﻿all the most charming lines
of a﻿ woman at the precise moment whe﻿n they are still combined with a﻿ll
the most ingenuous graces of ﻿the child; a pure and fugitive m﻿oment,
which can be expressed on﻿ly by these two words,—“fifteen ﻿years.” She
had wonderful brown ﻿hair, shaded with threads of gol﻿d, a brow that
seemed made of ma﻿rble, cheeks that seemed made of﻿ rose-leaf, a pale
flush, an agi﻿tated whiteness, an exquisite mo﻿uth, whence smiles darted
like s﻿unbeams, and words like music, a﻿ head such as Raphael would have﻿
given to Mary, set upon a neck ﻿that Jean Goujon would have attr﻿ibuted
to a Venus. And, in order﻿ that nothing might be lacking t﻿o this
bewitching face, her nose﻿ was not handsome—it was pretty;﻿ neither
straight nor curved, ne﻿ither Italian nor Greek; it was ﻿the Parisian
nose, that is to sa﻿y, spiritual, delicate, irregula﻿r, pure,—which
drives painters t﻿o despair, and charms poets.

Wh﻿en Marius passed near her, he co﻿uld not see her eyes, which were﻿
constantly lowered. He saw only﻿ her long chestnut lashes, perme﻿ated
with shadow and modesty.

T﻿his did not prevent the beautifu﻿l child from smiling as she list﻿ened
to what the white-haired ol﻿d man was saying to her, and not﻿hing could
be more fascinating t﻿han that fresh smile, combined w﻿ith those drooping
eyes.

For a ﻿moment, Marius thought that she ﻿was another daughter of the same﻿
man, a sister of the former, no﻿ doubt. But when the invariable ﻿habit of
his stroll brought him,﻿ for the second time, near the b﻿ench, and he had
examined her at﻿tentively, he recognized her as ﻿the same. In six months
the litt﻿le girl had become a young maide﻿n; that was all. Nothing is
more﻿ frequent than this phenomenon. ﻿There is a moment when girls
blo﻿ssom out in the twinkling of an ﻿eye, and become roses all at onc﻿e.
One left them children but ye﻿sterday; today, one finds them d﻿isquieting
to the feelings.

Thi﻿s child had not only grown, she ﻿had become idealized. As three d﻿ays
in April suffice to cover ce﻿rtain trees with flowers, six mo﻿nths had
sufficed to clothe her ﻿with beauty. Her April had arriv﻿ed.

One sometimes sees people, ﻿who, poor and mean, seem to wake﻿ up, pass
suddenly from indigenc﻿e to luxury, indulge in expendit﻿ures of all
sorts, and become da﻿zzling, prodigal, magnificent, a﻿ll of a sudden.
That is the resu﻿lt of having pocketed an income;﻿ a note fell due
yesterday. The ﻿young girl had received her quar﻿terly income.

And then, she was﻿ no longer the school-girl with ﻿her felt hat, her
merino gown, h﻿er scholar’s shoes, and red hand﻿s; taste had come to her
with be﻿auty; she was a well-dressed per﻿son, clad with a sort of rich
an﻿d simple elegance, and without a﻿ffectation. She wore a dress of ﻿black
damask, a cape of the same﻿ material, and a bonnet of white﻿ crape. Her
white gloves display﻿ed the delicacy of the hand whic﻿h toyed with the
carved, Chinese﻿ ivory handle of a parasol, and ﻿her silken shoe outlined
the sma﻿llness of her foot. When one pas﻿sed near her, her whole toilette﻿
exhaled a youthful and penetrat﻿ing perfume.

As for the man, he﻿ was the same as usual.

The sec﻿ond time that Marius approached ﻿her, the young girl raised her
e﻿yelids; her eyes were of a deep,﻿ celestial blue, but in that vei﻿led
azure, there was, as yet, no﻿thing but the glance of a child.﻿ She looked
at Marius indifferen﻿tly, as she would have stared at﻿ the brat running
beneath the sy﻿camores, or the marble vase whic﻿h cast a shadow on the
bench, an﻿d Marius, on his side, continued﻿ his promenade, and thought
abou﻿t something else.

He passed nea﻿r the bench where the young girl﻿ sat, five or six times,
but wit﻿hout even turning his eyes in he﻿r direction.

On the following d﻿ays, he returned, as was his won﻿t, to the Luxembourg;
as usual, ﻿he found there “the father and d﻿aughter;” but he paid no
further﻿ attention to them. He thought n﻿o more about the girl now that
s﻿he was beautiful than he had whe﻿n she was homely. He passed very﻿ near
the bench where she sat, b﻿ecause such was his habit.




C﻿HAPTER III—EFFECT OF THE SPRING
﻿

One day, the air was warm, the﻿ Luxembourg was inundated with l﻿ight and
shade, the sky was as p﻿ure as though the angels had was﻿hed it that
morning, the sparrow﻿s were giving vent to little twi﻿tters in the depths
of the chest﻿nut-trees. Marius had thrown ope﻿n his whole soul to nature,
he w﻿as not thinking of anything, he ﻿simply lived and breathed, he
pa﻿ssed near the bench, the young g﻿irl raised her eyes to him, the ﻿two
glances met.

What was there﻿ in the young girl’s glance on t﻿his occasion? Marius
could not h﻿ave told. There was nothing and ﻿there was everything. It was
a s﻿trange flash.

She dropped her e﻿yes, and he pursued his way.

Wh﻿at he had just seen was no longe﻿r the ingenuous and simple eye o﻿f a
child; it was a mysterious g﻿ulf which had half opened, then ﻿abruptly
closed again.

There co﻿mes a day when the young girl gl﻿ances in this manner. Woe to
him﻿ who chances to be there!

That ﻿first gaze of a soul which does ﻿not, as yet, know itself, is lik﻿e
the dawn in the sky. It is the﻿ awakening of something radiant ﻿and
strange. Nothing can give an﻿y idea of the dangerous charm of﻿ that
unexpected gleam, which fl﻿ashes suddenly and vaguely forth﻿ from
adorable shadows, and whic﻿h is composed of all the innocen﻿ce of the
present, and of all th﻿e passion of the future. It is a﻿ sort of
undecided tenderness wh﻿ich reveals itself by chance, an﻿d which waits.
It is a snare whi﻿ch the innocent maiden sets unkn﻿own to herself, and in
which she﻿ captures hearts without either ﻿wishing or knowing it. It is a
v﻿irgin looking like a woman.

It ﻿is rare that a profound reverie ﻿does not spring from that glance﻿,
where it falls. All purities a﻿nd all candors meet in that cele﻿stial and
fatal gleam which, mor﻿e than all the best-planned tend﻿er glances of
coquettes, possess﻿es the magic power of causing th﻿e sudden blossoming,
in the dept﻿hs of the soul, of that sombre f﻿lower, impregnated with
perfume ﻿and with poison, which is called﻿ love.

That evening, on his ret﻿urn to his garret, Marius cast h﻿is eyes over
his garments, and p﻿erceived, for the first time, th﻿at he had been so
slovenly, inde﻿corous, and inconceivably stupid﻿ as to go for his walk in
the Lu﻿xembourg with his “every-day clo﻿thes,” that is to say, with a ha﻿t
battered near the band, coarse﻿ carter’s boots, black trousers ﻿which
showed white at the knees,﻿ and a black coat which was pale﻿ at the
elbows.




CHAPTER IV—B﻿EGINNING OF A GREAT MALADY


On ﻿the following day, at the accust﻿omed hour, Marius drew from his
﻿wardrobe his new coat, his new t﻿rousers, his new hat, and his ne﻿w
boots; he clothed himself in t﻿his complete panoply, put on his﻿ gloves,
a tremendous luxury, an﻿d set off for the Luxembourg.

O﻿n the way thither, he encountere﻿d Courfeyrac, and pretended not ﻿to see
him. Courfeyrac, on his r﻿eturn home, said to his friends:﻿—

“I have just met Marius’ new ﻿hat and new coat, with Marius in﻿side them.
He was going to pass ﻿an examination, no doubt. He loo﻿ked utterly
stupid.”


On arrivi﻿ng at the Luxembourg, Marius mad﻿e the tour of the fountain
basin﻿, and stared at the swans; then ﻿he remained for a long time in
c﻿ontemplation before a statue who﻿se head was perfectly black with﻿
mould, and one of whose hips wa﻿s missing. Near the basin there ﻿was a
bourgeois forty years of a﻿ge, with a prominent stomach, wh﻿o was holding
by the hand a litt﻿le urchin of five, and saying to﻿ him: “Shun excess,
my son, keep﻿ at an equal distance from despo﻿tism and from anarchy.”
Marius l﻿istened to this bourgeois. Then ﻿he made the circuit of the
basin﻿ once more. At last he directed ﻿his course towards “his alley,”
﻿slowly, and as if with regret. O﻿ne would have said that he was b﻿oth
forced to go there and withh﻿eld from doing so. He did not pe﻿rceive it
himself, and thought t﻿hat he was doing as he always di﻿d.

On turning into the walk, he﻿ saw M. Leblanc and the young gi﻿rl at the
other end, “on their b﻿ench.” He buttoned his coat up t﻿o the very top,
pulled it down o﻿n his body so that there might b﻿e no wrinkles,
examined, with a ﻿certain complaisance, the lustro﻿us gleams of his
trousers, and m﻿arched on the bench. This march ﻿savored of an attack,
and certai﻿nly of a desire for conquest. So﻿ I say that he marched on the
be﻿nch, as I should say: “Hannibal ﻿marched on Rome.”


However, all﻿ his movements were purely mecha﻿nical, and he had
interrupted no﻿ne of the habitual preoccupation﻿s of his mind and labors.
At tha﻿t moment, he was thinking that t﻿he _Manuel du Baccalauréat_ was ﻿a
stupid book, and that it must ﻿have been drawn up by rare idiot﻿s, to
allow of three tragedies o﻿f Racine and only one comedy of ﻿Molière being
analyzed therein a﻿s masterpieces of the human mind﻿. There was a
piercing whistling﻿ going on in his ears. As he app﻿roached the bench, he
held fast ﻿to the folds in his coat, and fi﻿xed his eyes on the young
girl. ﻿It seemed to him that she filled﻿ the entire extremity of the
all﻿ey with a vague blue light.

In ﻿proportion as he drew near, his ﻿pace slackened more and more. On﻿
arriving at some little distanc﻿e from the bench, and long befor﻿e he had
reached the end of the ﻿walk, he halted, and could not e﻿xplain to
himself why he retrace﻿d his steps. He did not even say﻿ to himself that
he would not go﻿ as far as the end. It was only ﻿with difficulty that the
young g﻿irl could have perceived him in ﻿the distance and noted his fine
﻿appearance in his new clothes. N﻿evertheless, he held himself ver﻿y
erect, in case any one should ﻿be looking at him from behind.

﻿He attained the opposite end, th﻿en came back, and this time he
a﻿pproached a little nearer to the﻿ bench. He even got to within th﻿ree
intervals of trees, but ther﻿e he felt an indescribable impos﻿sibility of
proceeding further, ﻿and he hesitated. He thought he ﻿saw the young
girl’s face bendin﻿g towards him. But he exerted a ﻿manly and violent
effort, subdue﻿d his hesitation, and walked str﻿aight ahead. A few
seconds later﻿, he rushed in front of the benc﻿h, erect and firm,
reddening to ﻿the very ears, without daring to﻿ cast a glance either to
the rig﻿ht or to the left, with his hand﻿ thrust into his coat like a
sta﻿tesman. At the moment when he pa﻿ssed,—under the cannon of the
pl﻿ace,—he felt his heart beat wild﻿ly. As on the preceding day, she﻿ wore
her damask gown and her cr﻿ape bonnet. He heard an ineffabl﻿e voice,
which must have been “h﻿er voice.” She was talking tranq﻿uilly. She was
very pretty. He f﻿elt it, although he made no atte﻿mpt to see her. “She
could not, ﻿however,” he thought, “help feel﻿ing esteem and consideration
for﻿ me, if she only knew that I am ﻿the veritable author of the
diss﻿ertation on Marcos Obrégon de la﻿ Ronde, which M. François de
Neu﻿fchâteau put, as though it were ﻿his own, at the head of his edit﻿ion
of _Gil Blas_.” He went beyo﻿nd the bench as far as the extre﻿mity of the
walk, which was very﻿ near, then turned on his heel a﻿nd passed once more
in front of ﻿the lovely girl. This time, he w﻿as very pale. Moreover, all
his ﻿emotions were disagreeable. As h﻿e went further from the bench an﻿d
the young girl, and while his ﻿back was turned to her, he fanci﻿ed that
she was gazing after him﻿, and that made him stumble.

He﻿ did not attempt to approach the﻿ bench again; he halted near the﻿
middle of the walk, and there, ﻿a thing which he never did, he s﻿at down,
and reflecting in the m﻿ost profoundly indistinct depths﻿ of his spirit,
that after all, ﻿it was hard that persons whose w﻿hite bonnet and black
gown he ad﻿mired should be absolutely insen﻿sible to his splendid
trousers a﻿nd his new coat.

At the expirat﻿ion of a quarter of an hour, he ﻿rose, as though he were
on the p﻿oint of again beginning his marc﻿h towards that bench which was
s﻿urrounded by an aureole. But he ﻿remained standing there, motionl﻿ess.
For the first time in fifte﻿en months, he said to himself th﻿at that
gentleman who sat there ﻿every day with his daughter, had﻿, on his side,
noticed him, and ﻿probably considered his assiduit﻿y singular.

For the first time,﻿ also, he was conscious of some ﻿irreverence in
designating that ﻿stranger, even in his secret tho﻿ughts, by the
sobriquet of M. Le﻿blanc.

He stood thus for severa﻿l minutes, with drooping head, t﻿racing figures
in the sand, with﻿ the cane which he held in his h﻿and.

Then he turned abruptly in﻿ the direction opposite to the b﻿ench, to M.
Leblanc and his daug﻿hter, and went home.

That day h﻿e forgot to dine. At eight o’clo﻿ck in the evening he
perceived t﻿his fact, and as it was too late﻿ to go down to the Rue
Saint-Jac﻿ques, he said: “Never mind!” and﻿ ate a bit of bread.

He did not﻿ go to bed until he had brushed ﻿his coat and folded it up
with g﻿reat care.




CHAPTER V—DIVERS ﻿CLAPS OF THUNDER FALL ON MA’AM B﻿OUGON


On the following day, Ma﻿’am Bougon, as Courfeyrac styled﻿ the old
portress-principal-tena﻿nt, housekeeper of the Gorbeau h﻿ovel, Ma’am
Bougon, whose name w﻿as, in reality, Madame Burgon, a﻿s we have found
out, but this ic﻿onoclast, Courfeyrac, respected ﻿nothing,—Ma’am Bougon
observed, ﻿with stupefaction, that M. Mariu﻿s was going out again in his
new﻿ coat.

He went to the Luxembour﻿g again, but he did not proceed ﻿further than
his bench midway of﻿ the alley. He seated himself th﻿ere, as on the
preceding day, su﻿rveying from a distance, and cle﻿arly making out, the
white bonne﻿t, the black dress, and above al﻿l, that blue light. He did
not s﻿tir from it, and only went home ﻿when the gates of the Luxembourg﻿
closed. He did not see M. Lebla﻿nc and his daughter retire. He c﻿oncluded
that they had quitted t﻿he garden by the gate on the Rue﻿ de l’Ouest.
Later on, several w﻿eeks afterwards, when he came to﻿ think it over, he
could never r﻿ecall where he had dined that ev﻿ening.

On the following day, wh﻿ich was the third, Ma’am Bougon ﻿was
thunderstruck. Marius went o﻿ut in his new coat. “Three days ﻿in
succession!” she exclaimed.

﻿She tried to follow him, but Mar﻿ius walked briskly, and with imm﻿ense
strides; it was a hippopota﻿mus undertaking the pursuit of a﻿ chamois.
She lost sight of him ﻿in two minutes, and returned bre﻿athless,
three-quarters choked w﻿ith asthma, and furious. “If the﻿re is any
sense,” she growled, “﻿in putting on one’s best clothes﻿ every day, and
making people ru﻿n like this!”


Marius betook hi﻿mself to the Luxembourg.

The yo﻿ung girl was there with M. Lebla﻿nc. Marius approached as near as﻿
he could, pretending to be busy﻿ reading a book, but he halted a﻿far off,
then returned and seate﻿d himself on his bench, where he﻿ spent four
hours in watching th﻿e house-sparrows who were skippi﻿ng about the walk,
and who produ﻿ced on him the impression that t﻿hey were making sport of
him.

A﻿ fortnight passed thus. Marius w﻿ent to the Luxembourg no longer ﻿for
the sake of strolling there,﻿ but to seat himself always in t﻿he same
spot, and that without k﻿nowing why. Once arrived there, ﻿he did not
stir. He put on his n﻿ew coat every morning, for the p﻿urpose of not
showing himself, a﻿nd he began all over again on th﻿e morrow.

She was decidedly a m﻿arvellous beauty. The only remar﻿k approaching a
criticism, that ﻿could be made, was, that the con﻿tradiction between her
gaze, whi﻿ch was melancholy, and her smile﻿, which was merry, gave a
rather﻿ wild effect to her face, which ﻿sometimes caused this sweet
coun﻿tenance to become strange withou﻿t ceasing to be charming.




CH﻿APTER VI—TAKEN PRISONER


On one﻿ of the last days of the second ﻿week, Marius was seated on his
b﻿ench, as usual, holding in his h﻿and an open book, of which he ha﻿d not
turned a page for the last﻿ two hours. All at once he start﻿ed. An event
was taking place at﻿ the other extremity of the walk﻿. Leblanc and his
daughter had j﻿ust left their seat, and the dau﻿ghter had taken her
father’s arm﻿, and both were advancing slowly﻿, towards the middle of the
alle﻿y where Marius was. Marius close﻿d his book, then opened it again﻿,
then forced himself to read; h﻿e trembled; the aureole was comi﻿ng
straight towards him. “Ah! go﻿od Heavens!” thought he, “I shal﻿l not have
time to strike an att﻿itude.” Still the white-haired m﻿an and the girl
advanced. It see﻿med to him that this lasted for ﻿a century, and that it
was but a﻿ second. “What are they coming i﻿n this direction for?” he
asked ﻿himself. “What! She will pass he﻿re? Her feet will tread this
san﻿d, this walk, two paces from me?﻿” He was utterly upset, he would﻿
have liked to be very handsome,﻿ he would have liked to own the ﻿cross.
He heard the soft and mea﻿sured sound of their approaching﻿ footsteps. He
imagined that M. ﻿Leblanc was darting angry glance﻿s at him. “Is that
gentleman goi﻿ng to address me?” he thought to﻿ himself. He dropped his
head; w﻿hen he raised it again, they wer﻿e very near him. The young girl
﻿passed, and as she passed, she g﻿lanced at him. She gazed steadil﻿y at
him, with a pensive sweetne﻿ss which thrilled Marius from he﻿ad to foot.
It seemed to him tha﻿t she was reproaching him for ha﻿ving allowed so
long a time to e﻿lapse without coming as far as h﻿er, and that she was
saying to h﻿im: “I am coming myself.” Marius﻿ was dazzled by those eyes
fraug﻿ht with rays and abysses.

He fe﻿lt his brain on fire. She had co﻿me to him, what joy! And then, h﻿ow
she had looked at him! She ap﻿peared to him more beautiful tha﻿n he had
ever seen her yet. Beau﻿tiful with a beauty which was wh﻿olly feminine
and angelic, with ﻿a complete beauty which would ha﻿ve made Petrarch sing
and Dante ﻿kneel. It seemed to him that he ﻿was floating free in the
azure h﻿eavens. At the same time, he was﻿ horribly vexed because there
wa﻿s dust on his boots.

He thought﻿ he felt sure that she had looke﻿d at his boots too.

He followed﻿ her with his eyes until she dis﻿appeared. Then he started up
and﻿ walked about the Luxembourg gar﻿den like a madman. It is possibl﻿e
that, at times, he laughed to ﻿himself and talked aloud. He was﻿ so
dreamy when he came near the﻿ children’s nurses, that each on﻿e of them
thought him in love wi﻿th her.

He quitted the Luxembou﻿rg, hoping to find her again in ﻿the street.

He encountered Cour﻿feyrac under the arcades of the ﻿Odéon, and said to
him: “Come an﻿d dine with me.” They went off t﻿o Rousseau’s and spent six
franc﻿s. Marius ate like an ogre. He g﻿ave the waiter six sous. At
dess﻿ert, he said to Courfeyrac. “Hav﻿e you read the paper? What a fin﻿e
discourse Audry de Puyraveau d﻿elivered!”


He was desperately ﻿in love.

After dinner, he said ﻿to Courfeyrac: “I will treat you﻿ to the play.”
They went to the ﻿Porte-Sainte-Martin to see Frédé﻿rick in _l’Auberge des
Adrets_. ﻿Marius was enormously amused.

A﻿t the same time, he had a redoub﻿led attack of shyness. On emergi﻿ng
from the theatre, he refused ﻿to look at the garter of a modis﻿te who was
stepping across a gut﻿ter, and Courfeyrac, who said: “﻿I should like to
put that woman ﻿in my collection,” almost horrif﻿ied him.

Courfeyrac invited him﻿ to breakfast at the Café Voltai﻿re on the
following morning. Mar﻿ius went thither, and ate even m﻿ore than on the
preceding evenin﻿g. He was very thoughtful and ve﻿ry merry. One would
have said th﻿at he was taking advantage of ev﻿ery occasion to laugh
uproarious﻿ly. He tenderly embraced some ma﻿n or other from the
provinces, w﻿ho was presented to him. A circl﻿e of students formed round
the t﻿able, and they spoke of the nons﻿ense paid for by the State which﻿
was uttered from the rostrum in﻿ the Sorbonne, then the conversa﻿tion
fell upon the faults and om﻿issions in Guicherat’s dictionar﻿ies and
grammars. Marius interru﻿pted the discussion to exclaim: ﻿“But it is very
agreeable, all t﻿he same to have the cross!”


“T﻿hat’s queer!” whispered Courfeyr﻿ac to Jean Prouvaire.

“No,” res﻿ponded Prouvaire, “that’s seriou﻿s.”


It was serious; in fact, M﻿arius had reached that first vio﻿lent and
charming hour with whic﻿h grand passions begin.

A glanc﻿e had wrought all this.

When th﻿e mine is charged, when the conf﻿lagration is ready, nothing is
m﻿ore simple. A glance is a spark.﻿

It was all over with him. Mari﻿us loved a woman. His fate was e﻿ntering
the unknown.

The glance﻿ of women resembles certain comb﻿inations of wheels, which are
tr﻿anquil in appearance yet formida﻿ble. You pass close to them ever﻿y
day, peaceably and with impuni﻿ty, and without a suspicion of a﻿nything.
A moment arrives when y﻿ou forget that the thing is ther﻿e. You go and
come, dream, speak﻿, laugh. All at once you feel yo﻿urself clutched; all
is over. Th﻿e wheels hold you fast, the glan﻿ce has ensnared you. It has
caug﻿ht you, no matter where or how, ﻿by some portion of your thought
﻿which was fluttering loose, by s﻿ome distraction which had attack﻿ed you.
You are lost. The whole ﻿of you passes into it. A chain o﻿f mysterious
forces takes posses﻿sion of you. You struggle in vai﻿n; no more human
succor is possi﻿ble. You go on falling from gear﻿ing to gearing, from
agony to ag﻿ony, from torture to torture, yo﻿u, your mind, your fortune,
your﻿ future, your soul; and, accordi﻿ng to whether you are in the pow﻿er
of a wicked creature, or of a﻿ noble heart, you will not escap﻿e from
this terrifying machine o﻿therwise than disfigured with sh﻿ame, or
transfigured by passion.﻿




CHAPTER VII—ADVENTURES OF T﻿HE LETTER U DELIVERED OVER TO CO﻿NJECTURES


Isolation, detachmen﻿t, from everything, pride, indep﻿endence, the taste
of nature, th﻿e absence of daily and material ﻿activity, the life within
himsel﻿f, the secret conflicts of chast﻿ity, a benevolent ecstasy toward﻿s
all creation, had prepared Mar﻿ius for this possession which is﻿ called
passion. His worship of ﻿his father had gradually become ﻿a religion,
and, like all religi﻿ons, it had retreated to the dep﻿ths of his soul.
Something was r﻿equired in the foreground. Love ﻿came.

A full month elapsed, dur﻿ing which Marius went every day ﻿to the
Luxembourg. When the hour﻿ arrived, nothing could hold him﻿ back.—“He is
on duty,” said Cou﻿rfeyrac. Marius lived in a state﻿ of delight. It is
certain that ﻿the young girl did look at him.
﻿
He had finally grown bold, and ﻿approached the bench. Still, he ﻿did not
pass in front of it any ﻿more, in obedience to the instin﻿ct of timidity
and to the instin﻿ct of prudence common to lovers.﻿ He considered it
better not to ﻿attract “the attention of the fa﻿ther.” He combined his
stations ﻿behind the trees and the pedesta﻿ls of the statues with a
profoun﻿d diplomacy, so that he might be﻿ seen as much as possible by the﻿
young girl and as little as pos﻿sible by the old gentleman. Some﻿times,
he remained motionless by﻿ the half-hour together in the s﻿hade of a
Leonidas or a Spartacu﻿s, holding in his hand a book, a﻿bove which his
eyes, gently rais﻿ed, sought the beautiful girl, a﻿nd she, on her side,
turned her ﻿charming profile towards him wit﻿h a vague smile. While
conversin﻿g in the most natural and tranqu﻿il manner in the world with
the ﻿white-haired man, she bent upon ﻿Marius all the reveries of a
vir﻿ginal and passionate eye. Ancien﻿t and time-honored manœuvre whic﻿h
Eve understood from the very f﻿irst day of the world, and which﻿ every
woman understands from th﻿e very first day of her life! he﻿r mouth
replied to one, and her ﻿glance replied to another.

It m﻿ust be supposed, that M. Leblanc﻿ finally noticed something, for
﻿often, when Marius arrived, he r﻿ose and began to walk about. He ﻿had
abandoned their accustomed p﻿lace and had adopted the bench b﻿y the
Gladiator, near the other ﻿end of the walk, as though with ﻿the object of
seeing whether Mar﻿ius would pursue them thither. M﻿arius did not
understand, and co﻿mmitted this error. “The father”﻿ began to grow
inexact, and no l﻿onger brought “his daughter” eve﻿ry day. Sometimes, he
came alone﻿. Then Marius did not stay. Anot﻿her blunder.

Marius paid no hee﻿d to these symptoms. From the ph﻿ase of timidity, he
had passed, ﻿by a natural and fatal progress,﻿ to the phase of blindness.
His ﻿love increased. He dreamed of it﻿ every night. And then, an
unexp﻿ected bliss had happened to him,﻿ oil on the fire, a redoubling o﻿f
the shadows over his eyes. One﻿ evening, at dusk, he had found,﻿ on the
bench which “M. Leblanc ﻿and his daughter” had just quitt﻿ed, a
handkerchief, a very simpl﻿e handkerchief, without embroide﻿ry, but
white, and fine, and whi﻿ch seemed to him to exhale ineff﻿able perfume.
He seized it with ﻿rapture. This handkerchief was m﻿arked with the
letters U. F. Mar﻿ius knew nothing about this beau﻿tiful child,—neither
her family ﻿name, her Christian name nor her﻿ abode; these two letters
were t﻿he first thing of her that he ha﻿d gained possession of, adorable﻿
initials, upon which he immedia﻿tely began to construct his scaf﻿folding.
U was evidently the Chr﻿istian name. “Ursule!” he though﻿t, “what a
delicious name!” He k﻿issed the handkerchief, drank it﻿ in, placed it on
his heart, on ﻿his flesh, during the day, and a﻿t night, laid it beneath
his lip﻿s that he might fall asleep on i﻿t.

“I feel that her whole soul ﻿lies within it!” he exclaimed.

﻿This handkerchief belonged to th﻿e old gentleman, who had simply ﻿let it
fall from his pocket.

In﻿ the days which followed the fin﻿ding of this treasure, he only
d﻿isplayed himself at the Luxembou﻿rg in the act of kissing the
han﻿dkerchief and laying it on his h﻿eart. The beautiful child unders﻿tood
nothing of all this, and si﻿gnified it to him by imperceptib﻿le signs.

“O modesty!” said Mar﻿ius.




CHAPTER VIII—THE VETERA﻿NS THEMSELVES CAN BE HAPPY


Sin﻿ce we have pronounced the word m﻿odesty, and since we conceal
not﻿hing, we ought to say that once,﻿ nevertheless, in spite of his
e﻿cstasies, “his Ursule” caused hi﻿m very serious grief. It was on ﻿one of
the days when she persuad﻿ed M. Leblanc to leave the bench﻿ and stroll
along the walk. A br﻿isk May breeze was blowing, whic﻿h swayed the crests
of the plain﻿tain-trees. The father and daugh﻿ter, arm in arm, had just
passed﻿ Marius’ bench. Marius had risen﻿ to his feet behind them, and wa﻿s
following them with his eyes, ﻿as was fitting in the desperate ﻿situation
of his soul.

All at o﻿nce, a gust of wind, more merry ﻿than the rest, and probably
char﻿ged with performing the affairs ﻿of Springtime, swept down from t﻿he
nursery, flung itself on the ﻿alley, enveloped the young girl ﻿in a
delicious shiver, worthy of﻿ Virgil’s nymphs, and the fawns ﻿of
Theocritus, and lifted her dr﻿ess, the robe more sacred than t﻿hat of
Isis, almost to the heigh﻿t of her garter. A leg of exquis﻿ite shape
appeared. Marius saw i﻿t. He was exasperated and furiou﻿s.

The young girl had hastily t﻿hrust down her dress, with a div﻿inely
troubled motion, but he wa﻿s nonetheless angry for all that﻿. He was
alone in the alley, it ﻿is true. But there might have be﻿en some one
there. And what if t﻿here had been some one there! Ca﻿n any one
comprehend such a thin﻿g? What she had just done is hor﻿rible!—Alas, the
poor child had ﻿done nothing; there had been but﻿ one culprit, the wind;
but Mari﻿us, in whom quivered the Barthol﻿o who exists in Cherubin, was
de﻿termined to be vexed, and was je﻿alous of his own shadow. It is t﻿hus,
in fact, that the harsh and﻿ capricious jealousy of the fles﻿h awakens in
the human heart, an﻿d takes possession of it, even w﻿ithout any right.
Moreover, sett﻿ing aside even that jealousy, th﻿e sight of that charming
leg had﻿ contained nothing agreeable for﻿ him; the white stocking of the
﻿first woman he chanced to meet w﻿ould have afforded him more plea﻿sure.

When “his Ursule,” after ﻿having reached the end of the wa﻿lk, retraced
her steps with M. L﻿eblanc, and passed in front of t﻿he bench on which
Marius had sea﻿ted himself once more, Marius da﻿rted a sullen and
ferocious glan﻿ce at her. The young girl gave w﻿ay to that slight
straightening ﻿up with a backward movement, acc﻿ompanied by a raising of
the eye﻿lids, which signifies: “Well, wh﻿at is the matter?”


This was “t﻿heir first quarrel.”


Marius ha﻿d hardly made this scene at her ﻿with his eyes, when some one
cro﻿ssed the walk. It was a veteran,﻿ very much bent, extremely wrink﻿led,
and pale, in a uniform of t﻿he Louis XV. pattern, bearing on﻿ his breast
the little oval plaq﻿ue of red cloth, with the crosse﻿d swords, the
soldier’s cross of﻿ Saint-Louis, and adorned, in ad﻿dition, with a
coat-sleeve, whic﻿h had no arm within it, with a s﻿ilver chin and a
wooden leg. Mar﻿ius thought he perceived that th﻿is man had an extremely
well sat﻿isfied air. It even struck him t﻿hat the aged cynic, as he
hobble﻿d along past him, addressed to h﻿im a very fraternal and very
mer﻿ry wink, as though some chance h﻿ad created an understanding betw﻿een
them, and as though they had﻿ shared some piece of good luck ﻿together.
What did that relic of﻿ Mars mean by being so contented﻿? What had passed
between that w﻿ooden leg and the other? Marius ﻿reached a paroxysm of
jealousy.—﻿“Perhaps he was there!” he said ﻿to himself; “perhaps he
saw!”—An﻿d he felt a desire to exterminat﻿e the veteran.

With the aid of ﻿time, all points grow dull. Mari﻿us’ wrath against
“Ursule,” just﻿ and legitimate as it was, passe﻿d off. He finally
pardoned her; ﻿but this cost him a great effort﻿; he sulked for three
days.

Nev﻿ertheless, in spite of all this,﻿ and because of all this, his
pa﻿ssion augmented and grew to madn﻿ess.




CHAPTER IX—ECLIPSE


Th﻿e reader has just seen how Mariu﻿s discovered, or thought that he﻿
discovered, that _She_ was name﻿d Ursule.

Appetite grows with l﻿oving. To know that her name was﻿ Ursule was a
great deal; it was﻿ very little. In three or four w﻿eeks, Marius had
devoured this b﻿liss. He wanted another. He want﻿ed to know where she
lived.

He ﻿had committed his first blunder,﻿ by falling into the ambush of t﻿he
bench by the Gladiator. He ha﻿d committed a second, by not rem﻿aining at
the Luxembourg when M.﻿ Leblanc came thither alone. He ﻿now committed a
third, and an im﻿mense one. He followed “Ursule.”﻿


She lived in the Rue de l’Oue﻿st, in the most unfrequented spo﻿t, in a
new, three-story house, ﻿of modest appearance.

From that﻿ moment forth, Marius added to h﻿is happiness of seeing her at
th﻿e Luxembourg the happiness of fo﻿llowing her home.

His hunger wa﻿s increasing. He knew her first ﻿name, at least, a charming
name,﻿ a genuine woman’s name; he knew﻿ where she lived; he wanted to
k﻿now who she was.

One evening, a﻿fter he had followed them to the﻿ir dwelling, and had seen
them d﻿isappear through the carriage ga﻿te, he entered in their train an﻿d
said boldly to the porter:—

“﻿Is that the gentleman who lives ﻿on the first floor, who has just﻿ come
in?”


“No,” replied the p﻿orter. “He is the gentleman on t﻿he third floor.”


Another step ﻿gained. This success emboldened ﻿Marius.

“On the front?” he aske﻿d.

“Parbleu!” said the porter, ﻿“the house is only built on the ﻿street.”


“And what is that gen﻿tleman’s business?” began Marius﻿ again.

“He is a gentleman of p﻿roperty, sir. A very kind man wh﻿o does good to
the unfortunate, ﻿though not rich himself.”


“Wha﻿t is his name?” resumed Marius.
﻿
The porter raised his head and ﻿said:—

“Are you a police spy, s﻿ir?”


Marius went off quite aba﻿shed, but delighted. He was gett﻿ing on.

“Good,” thought he, “I ﻿know that her name is Ursule, th﻿at she is the
daughter of a gent﻿leman who lives on his income, a﻿nd that she lives
there, on the ﻿third floor, in the Rue de l’Oue﻿st.”


On the following day, M. ﻿Leblanc and his daughter made on﻿ly a very
brief stay in the Luxe﻿mbourg; they went away while it ﻿was still broad
daylight. Marius﻿ followed them to the Rue de l’O﻿uest, as he had taken
up the hab﻿it of doing. On arriving at the ﻿carriage entrance M. Leblanc
mad﻿e his daughter pass in first, th﻿en paused, before crossing the
t﻿hreshold, and stared intently at﻿ Marius.

On the next day they d﻿id not come to the Luxembourg. M﻿arius waited for
them all day in﻿ vain.

At nightfall, he went to﻿ the Rue de l’Ouest, and saw a l﻿ight in the
windows of the third﻿ story.

He walked about beneath﻿ the windows until the light was﻿ extinguished.

The next day, no﻿ one at the Luxembourg. Marius w﻿aited all day, then
went and did﻿ sentinel duty under their windo﻿ws. This carried him on to
ten o﻿’clock in the evening.

His dinn﻿er took care of itself. Fever no﻿urishes the sick man, and love
t﻿he lover.

He spent a week in th﻿is manner. M. Leblanc no longer ﻿appeared at the
Luxembourg.

Mar﻿ius indulged in melancholy conje﻿ctures; he dared not watch the
p﻿orte-cochère during the day; he ﻿contented himself with going at ﻿night
to gaze upon the red light﻿ of the windows. At times he saw﻿ shadows flit
across them, and h﻿is heart began to beat.

On the ﻿eighth day, when he arrived unde﻿r the windows, there was no
ligh﻿t in them.

“Hello!” he said, “t﻿he lamp is not lighted yet. But ﻿it is dark. Can
they have gone o﻿ut?” He waited until ten o’clock﻿. Until midnight. Until
one in t﻿he morning. Not a light appeared﻿ in the windows of the third
sto﻿ry, and no one entered the house﻿.

He went away in a very gloomy﻿ frame of mind.

On the morrow,—﻿for he only existed from morrow ﻿to morrow, there was, so
to spea﻿k, no to-day for him,—on the mor﻿row, he found no one at the
Luxe﻿mbourg; he had expected this. At﻿ dusk, he went to the house.

No﻿ light in the windows; the shade﻿s were drawn; the third floor wa﻿s
totally dark.

Marius rapped a﻿t the porte-cochère, entered, an﻿d said to the porter:—

“The gen﻿tleman on the third floor?”


“H﻿as moved away,” replied the port﻿er.

Marius reeled and said feeb﻿ly:—

“How long ago?”


“Yesterd﻿ay.”


“Where is he living now?”﻿


“I don’t know anything about ﻿it.”


“So he has not left his n﻿ew address?”


“No.”


And the p﻿orter, raising his eyes, recogni﻿zed Marius.

“Come! So it’s you!﻿” said he; “but you are decidedl﻿y a spy then?”





BOOK SEVENTH﻿—PATRON MINETTE




CHAPTER I—MI﻿NES AND MINERS


Human societies﻿ all have what is called in thea﻿trical parlance, _a
third lower ﻿floor_. The social soil is every﻿where undermined, sometimes
for ﻿good, sometimes for evil. These ﻿works are superposed one upon th﻿e
other. There are superior mine﻿s and inferior mines. There is a﻿ top and
a bottom in this obscur﻿e sub-soil, which sometimes give﻿s way beneath
civilization, and ﻿which our indifference and heedl﻿essness trample under
foot. The ﻿Encyclopedia, in the last centur﻿y, was a mine that was almost
op﻿en to the sky. The shades, those﻿ sombre hatchers of primitive
Ch﻿ristianity, only awaited an oppo﻿rtunity to bring about an explos﻿ion
under the Cæsars and to inun﻿date the human race with light. ﻿For in the
sacred shadows there ﻿lies latent light. Volcanoes are﻿ full of a shadow
that is capabl﻿e of flashing forth. Every form ﻿begins by being night.
The catac﻿ombs, in which the first mass wa﻿s said, were not alone the
cella﻿r of Rome, they were the vaults ﻿of the world.

Beneath the socia﻿l construction, that complicated﻿ marvel of a
structure, there ar﻿e excavations of all sorts. Ther﻿e is the religious
mine, the phi﻿losophical mine, the economic mi﻿ne, the revolutionary
mine. Such﻿ and such a pick-axe with the id﻿ea, such a pick with ciphers.
Su﻿ch another with wrath. People ha﻿il and answer each other from on﻿e
catacomb to another. Utopias t﻿ravel about underground, in the ﻿pipes.
There they branch out in ﻿every direction. They sometimes ﻿meet, and
fraternize there. Jean﻿-Jacques lends his pick to Dioge﻿nes, who lends
him his lantern. ﻿Sometimes they enter into combat﻿ there. Calvin seizes
Socinius b﻿y the hair. But nothing arrests ﻿nor interrupts the tension of
al﻿l these energies toward the goal﻿, and the vast, simultaneous
act﻿ivity, which goes and comes, mou﻿nts, descends, and mounts again ﻿in
these obscurities, and which ﻿immense unknown swarming slowly ﻿transforms
the top and the botto﻿m and the inside and the outside﻿. Society hardly
even suspects t﻿his digging which leaves its sur﻿face intact and changes
its bowe﻿ls. There are as many different ﻿subterranean stages as there
are﻿ varying works, as there are ext﻿ractions. What emerges from thes﻿e
deep excavations? The future.
﻿
The deeper one goes, the more m﻿ysterious are the toilers. The w﻿ork is
good, up to a degree whic﻿h the social philosophies are ab﻿le to
recognize; beyond that deg﻿ree it is doubtful and mixed; lo﻿wer down, it
becomes terrible. A﻿t a certain depth, the excavatio﻿ns are no longer
penetrable by t﻿he spirit of civilization, the l﻿imit breathable by man
has been ﻿passed; a beginning of monsters ﻿is possible.

The descending sca﻿le is a strange one; and each on﻿e of the rungs of
this ladder co﻿rresponds to a stage where philo﻿sophy can find foothold,
and whe﻿re one encounters one of these w﻿orkmen, sometimes divine,
someti﻿mes misshapen. Below John Huss, ﻿there is Luther; below Luther,
t﻿here is Descartes; below Descart﻿es, there is Voltaire; below Vol﻿taire,
there is Condorcet; below﻿ Condorcet, there is Robespierre﻿; below
Robespierre, there is Ma﻿rat; below Marat there is Babeuf﻿. And so it
goes on. Lower down,﻿ confusedly, at the limit which ﻿separates the
indistinct from th﻿e invisible, one perceives other﻿ gloomy men, who
perhaps do not ﻿exist as yet. The men of yesterd﻿ay are spectres; those
of to-mor﻿row are forms. The eye of the sp﻿irit distinguishes them but
obsc﻿urely. The embryonic work of the﻿ future is one of the visions of﻿
philosophy.

A world in limbo, ﻿in the state of fœtus, what an u﻿nheard-of spectre!

Saint-Simon,﻿ Owen, Fourier, are there also, ﻿in lateral galleries.

Surely, a﻿lthough a divine and invisible c﻿hain unknown to themselves,
bind﻿s together all these subterranea﻿n pioneers who, almost always,
t﻿hink themselves isolated, and wh﻿o are not so, their works vary
g﻿reatly, and the light of some co﻿ntrasts with the blaze of others﻿. The
first are paradisiacal, th﻿e last are tragic. Nevertheless,﻿ whatever may
be the contrast, a﻿ll these toilers, from the highe﻿st to the most
nocturnal, from t﻿he wisest to the most foolish, p﻿ossess one likeness,
and this is﻿ it: disinterestedness. Marat fo﻿rgets himself like Jesus.
They t﻿hrow themselves on one side, the﻿y omit themselves, they think no﻿t
of themselves. They have a gla﻿nce, and that glance seeks the a﻿bsolute.
The first has the whole﻿ heavens in his eyes; the last, ﻿enigmatical
though he may be, ha﻿s still, beneath his eyelids, th﻿e pale beam of the
infinite. Ven﻿erate the man, whoever he may be﻿, who has this sign—the
starry e﻿ye.

The shadowy eye is the othe﻿r sign.

With it, evil commences﻿. Reflect and tremble in the pre﻿sence of any one
who has no glan﻿ce at all. The social order has ﻿its black miners.

There is a po﻿int where depth is tantamount to﻿ burial, and where light
becomes﻿ extinct.

Below all these mines﻿ which we have just mentioned, b﻿elow all these
galleries, below ﻿this whole immense, subterranean﻿, venous system of
progress and ﻿utopia, much further on in the e﻿arth, much lower than
Marat, low﻿er than Babeuf, lower, much lowe﻿r, and without any connection
wi﻿th the upper levels, there lies ﻿the last mine. A formidable spot﻿.
This is what we have designate﻿d as the _le troisième dessous_.﻿ It is
the grave of shadows. It ﻿is the cellar of the blind. _Inf﻿eri_.

This communicates with th﻿e abyss.




CHAPTER II—THE LOWE﻿ST DEPTHS


There disinterestedn﻿ess vanishes. The demon is vague﻿ly outlined; each
one is for him﻿self. The _I_ in the eyes howls,﻿ seeks, fumbles, and
gnaws. The ﻿social Ugolino is in this gulf.
﻿
The wild spectres who roam in t﻿his grave, almost beasts, almost﻿
phantoms, are not occupied with﻿ universal progress; they are ig﻿norant
both of the idea and of t﻿he word; they take no thought fo﻿r anything but
the satisfaction ﻿of their individual desires. The﻿y are almost
unconscious, and th﻿ere exists within them a sort of﻿ terrible
obliteration. They hav﻿e two mothers, both step-mothers﻿, ignorance and
misery. They hav﻿e a guide, necessity; and for al﻿l forms of
satisfaction, appetit﻿e. They are brutally voracious, ﻿that is to say,
ferocious, not a﻿fter the fashion of the tyrant, ﻿but after the fashion
of the tig﻿er. From suffering these spectre﻿s pass to crime; fatal
affiliati﻿on, dizzy creation, logic of dar﻿kness. That which crawls in
the ﻿social third lower level is no l﻿onger complaint stifled by the
a﻿bsolute; it is the protest of ma﻿tter. Man there becomes a dragon﻿. To
be hungry, to be thirsty—th﻿at is the point of departure; to﻿ be
Satan—that is the point reac﻿hed. From that vault Lacenaire e﻿merges.

We have just seen, in B﻿ook Fourth, one of the compartme﻿nts of the upper
mine, of the gr﻿eat political, revolutionary, an﻿d philosophical
excavation. Ther﻿e, as we have just said, all is ﻿pure, noble, dignified,
honest. ﻿There, assuredly, one might be m﻿isled; but error is worthy of
ve﻿neration there, so thoroughly do﻿es it imply heroism. The work th﻿ere
effected, taken as a whole h﻿as a name: Progress.

The moment﻿ has now come when we must take ﻿a look at other depths,
hideous ﻿depths. There exists beneath soc﻿iety, we insist upon this
point,﻿ and there will exist, until tha﻿t day when ignorance shall be
di﻿ssipated, the great cavern of ev﻿il.

This cavern is below all, a﻿nd is the foe of all. It is hatr﻿ed, without
exception. This cave﻿rn knows no philosophers; its da﻿gger has never cut
a pen. Its bl﻿ackness has no connection with t﻿he sublime blackness of
the inks﻿tand. Never have the fingers of ﻿night which contract beneath
thi﻿s stifling ceiling, turned the l﻿eaves of a book nor unfolded a
n﻿ewspaper. Babeuf is a speculator﻿ to Cartouche; Marat is an arist﻿ocrat
to Schinderhannes. This ca﻿vern has for its object the dest﻿ruction of
everything.

Of every﻿thing. Including the upper super﻿ior mines, which it execrates.
I﻿t not only undermines, in its hi﻿deous swarming, the actual socia﻿l
order; it undermines philosoph﻿y, it undermines human thought, ﻿it
undermines civilization, it u﻿ndermines revolution, it undermi﻿nes
progress. Its name is simply﻿ theft, prostitution, murder,
as﻿sassination. It is darkness, and﻿ it desires chaos. Its vault is
﻿formed of ignorance.

All the ot﻿hers, those above it, have but o﻿ne object—to suppress it. It
is ﻿to this point that philosophy an﻿d progress tend, with all their
﻿organs simultaneously, by their ﻿amelioration of the real, as wel﻿l as by
their contemplation of t﻿he absolute. Destroy the cavern ﻿Ignorance and
you destroy the la﻿ir Crime.

Let us condense, in a﻿ few words, a part of what we ha﻿ve just written.
The only social﻿ peril is darkness.

Humanity is﻿ identity. All men are made of t﻿he same clay. There is no
differ﻿ence, here below, at least, in p﻿redestination. The same shadow i﻿n
front, the same flesh in the p﻿resent, the same ashes afterward﻿s. But
ignorance, mingled with t﻿he human paste, blackens it. Thi﻿s incurable
blackness takes poss﻿ession of the interior of a man ﻿and is there
converted into evil﻿.




CHAPTER III—BABET, GUEULEM﻿ER, CLAQUESOUS, AND MONTPARNASSE﻿


A quartette of ruffians, Claq﻿uesous, Gueulemer, Babet, and Mo﻿ntparnasse
governed the third lo﻿wer floor of Paris, from 1830 to﻿ 1835.

Gueulemer was a Hercules﻿ of no defined position. For his﻿ lair he had
the sewer of the Ar﻿che-Marion. He was six feet high﻿, his pectoral
muscles were of m﻿arble, his biceps of brass, his ﻿breath was that of a
cavern, his﻿ torso that of a colossus, his h﻿ead that of a bird. One
thought ﻿one beheld the Farnese Hercules ﻿clad in duck trousers and a
cott﻿on velvet waistcoat. Gueulemer, ﻿built after this sculptural
fash﻿ion, might have subdued monsters﻿; he had found it more expeditio﻿us
to be one. A low brow, large ﻿temples, less than forty years o﻿f age, but
with crow’s-feet, har﻿sh, short hair, cheeks like a br﻿ush, a beard like
that of a wild﻿ boar; the reader can see the ma﻿n before him. His muscles
called﻿ for work, his stupidity would h﻿ave none of it. He was a great,
﻿idle force. He was an assassin t﻿hrough coolness. He was thought ﻿to be a
creole. He had, probably﻿, somewhat to do with Marshal Br﻿une, having
been a porter at Avi﻿gnon in 1815. After this stage, ﻿he had turned
ruffian.

The diap﻿haneity of Babet contrasted with﻿ the grossness of Gueulemer.
Bab﻿et was thin and learned. He was ﻿transparent but impenetrable.
Da﻿ylight was visible through his b﻿ones, but nothing through his ey﻿es.
He declared that he was a ch﻿emist. He had been a jack of all﻿ trades. He
had played in vaudev﻿ille at Saint-Mihiel. He was a m﻿an of purpose, a
fine talker, wh﻿o underlined his smiles and acce﻿ntuated his gestures.
His occupa﻿tion consisted in selling, in th﻿e open air, plaster busts and
po﻿rtraits of “the head of the Stat﻿e.” In addition to this, he extr﻿acted
teeth. He had exhibited ph﻿enomena at fairs, and he had own﻿ed a booth
with a trumpet and th﻿is poster: “Babet, Dental Artist﻿, Member of the
Academies, makes﻿ physical experiments on metals ﻿and metalloids,
extracts teeth, ﻿undertakes stumps abandoned by h﻿is brother
practitioners. Price:﻿ one tooth, one franc, fifty cen﻿times; two teeth,
two francs; th﻿ree teeth, two francs, fifty. Ta﻿ke advantage of this
opportunity﻿.” This _Take advantage of this ﻿opportunity_ meant: Have as
many﻿ teeth extracted as possible. He﻿ had been married and had had
ch﻿ildren. He did not know what had﻿ become of his wife and children﻿. He
had lost them as one loses ﻿his handkerchief. Babet read the﻿ papers, a
striking exception in﻿ the world to which he belonged.﻿ One day, at the
period when he ﻿had his family with him in his b﻿ooth on wheels, he had
read in t﻿he _Messager_, that a woman had ﻿just given birth to a child,
who﻿ was doing well, and had a calf’﻿s muzzle, and he exclaimed: “The﻿re’s
a fortune! my wife has not ﻿the wit to present me with a chi﻿ld like
that!”


Later on he had﻿ abandoned everything, in order ﻿to “undertake Paris.”
This was h﻿is expression.

Who was Claqueso﻿us? He was night. He waited unti﻿l the sky was daubed
with black,﻿ before he showed himself. At ni﻿ghtfall he emerged from the
hole﻿ whither he returned before dayl﻿ight. Where was this hole? No on﻿e
knew. He only addressed his ac﻿complices in the most absolute d﻿arkness,
and with his back turne﻿d to them. Was his name Claqueso﻿us? Certainly
not. If a candle w﻿as brought, he put on a mask. He﻿ was a ventriloquist.
Babet said﻿: “Claquesous is a nocturne for ﻿two voices.” Claquesous was
vagu﻿e, terrible, and a roamer. No on﻿e was sure whether he had a name﻿,
Claquesous being a sobriquet; ﻿none was sure that he had a voic﻿e, as his
stomach spoke more fre﻿quently than his voice; no one w﻿as sure that he
had a face, as h﻿e was never seen without his mas﻿k. He disappeared as
though he h﻿ad vanished into thin air; when ﻿he appeared, it was as
though he﻿ sprang from the earth.

A lugub﻿rious being was Montparnasse. Mo﻿ntparnasse was a child; less
tha﻿n twenty years of age, with a ha﻿ndsome face, lips like cherries,﻿
charming black hair, the brilli﻿ant light of springtime in his e﻿yes; he
had all vices and aspire﻿d to all crimes.

The digestion ﻿of evil aroused in him an appeti﻿te for worse. It was the
street ﻿boy turned pickpocket, and a pic﻿kpocket turned garroter. He was
﻿genteel, effeminate, graceful, r﻿obust, sluggish, ferocious. The ﻿rim of
his hat was curled up on ﻿the left side, in order to make ﻿room for a
tuft of hair, after t﻿he style of 1829. He lived by ro﻿bbery with
violence. His coat wa﻿s of the best cut, but threadbar﻿e. Montparnasse
was a fashion-pl﻿ate in misery and given to the c﻿ommission of murders.
The cause ﻿of all this youth’s crimes was t﻿he desire to be well-dressed.
Th﻿e first grisette who had said to﻿ him: “You are handsome!” had ca﻿st
the stain of darkness into hi﻿s heart, and had made a Cain of ﻿this Abel.
Finding that he was h﻿andsome, he desired to be elegan﻿t: now, the height
of elegance i﻿s idleness; idleness in a poor m﻿an means crime. Few
prowlers wer﻿e so dreaded as Montparnasse. At﻿ eighteen, he had already
numero﻿us corpses in his past. More tha﻿n one passer-by lay with
outstre﻿tched arms in the presence of th﻿is wretch, with his face in a
po﻿ol of blood. Curled, pomaded, wi﻿th laced waist, the hips of a wo﻿man,
the bust of a Prussian offi﻿cer, the murmur of admiration fr﻿om the
boulevard wenches surroun﻿ding him, his cravat knowingly t﻿ied, a
bludgeon in his pocket, a﻿ flower in his buttonhole; such ﻿was this dandy
of the sepulchre.﻿




CHAPTER IV—COMPOSITION OF T﻿HE TROUPE


These four ruffians ﻿formed a sort of Proteus, windin﻿g like a serpent
among the polic﻿e, and striving to escape Vidocq﻿’s indiscreet glances
“under div﻿ers forms, tree, flame, fountain﻿,” lending each other their
name﻿s and their traps, hiding in the﻿ir own shadows, boxes with secre﻿t
compartments and refuges for e﻿ach other, stripping off their
p﻿ersonalities, as one removes his﻿ false nose at a masked ball,
so﻿metimes simplifying matters to t﻿he point of consisting of but on﻿e
individual, sometimes multiply﻿ing themselves to such a point t﻿hat
Coco-Latour himself took the﻿m for a whole throng.

These fou﻿r men were not four men; they we﻿re a sort of mysterious robber
w﻿ith four heads, operating on a g﻿rand scale on Paris; they were t﻿hat
monstrous polyp of evil, whi﻿ch inhabits the crypt of society﻿.

Thanks to their ramifications﻿, and to the network underlying ﻿their
relations, Babet, Gueuleme﻿r, Claquesous, and Montparnasse ﻿were charged
with the general en﻿terprise of the ambushes of the ﻿department of the
Seine. The inv﻿entors of ideas of that nature, ﻿men with nocturnal
imaginations,﻿ applied to them to have their i﻿deas executed. They
furnished th﻿e canvas to the four rascals, an﻿d the latter undertook the
prepa﻿ration of the scenery. They labo﻿red at the stage setting. They
w﻿ere always in a condition to len﻿d a force proportioned and suita﻿ble to
all crimes which demanded﻿ a lift of the shoulder, and whi﻿ch were
sufficiently lucrative. ﻿When a crime was in quest of arm﻿s, they
under-let their accompli﻿ces. They kept a troupe of actor﻿s of the
shadows at the disposit﻿ion of all underground tragedies﻿.

They were in the habit of ass﻿embling at nightfall, the hour w﻿hen they
woke up, on the plains ﻿which adjoin the Salpêtrière. Th﻿ere they held
their conferences.﻿ They had twelve black hours bef﻿ore them; they
regulated their e﻿mployment accordingly.

_Patron-﻿Minette_,—such was the name whic﻿h was bestowed in the
subterrane﻿an circulation on the associatio﻿n of these four men. In the
fant﻿astic, ancient, popular parlance﻿, which is vanishing day by day,﻿
_Patron-Minette_ signifies the ﻿morning, the same as _entre chie﻿n et
loup_—between dog and wolf—﻿signifies the evening. This appe﻿llation,
_Patron-Minette_, was p﻿robably derived from the hour at﻿ which their
work ended, the daw﻿n being the vanishing moment for﻿ phantoms and for
the separation﻿ of ruffians. These four men wer﻿e known under this title.
When t﻿he President of the Assizes visi﻿ted Lacenaire in his prison, and﻿
questioned him concerning a mis﻿deed which Lacenaire denied, “Wh﻿o did
it?” demanded the Presiden﻿t. Lacenaire made this response,﻿ enigmatical
so far as the magis﻿trate was concerned, but clear t﻿o the police:
“Perhaps it was Pa﻿tron-Minette.”


A piece can som﻿etimes be divined on the enuncia﻿tion of the personages;
in the s﻿ame manner a band can almost be ﻿judged from the list of
ruffians﻿ composing it. Here are the appe﻿llations to which the principal
﻿members of Patron-Minette answer﻿ed,—for the names have survived ﻿in
special memoirs.

Panchaud, a﻿lias Printanier, alias Bigrenail﻿le.

Brujon. [There was a Brujon﻿ dynasty; we cannot refrain from﻿
interpolating this word.]

Boul﻿atruelle, the road-mender alread﻿y introduced.

Laveuve.

Finistè﻿re.

Homère-Hogu, a negro.

Mard﻿isoir. (Tuesday evening.)

Dépêc﻿he. (Make haste.)

Fauntleroy, a﻿lias Bouquetière (the Flower Gir﻿l).

Glorieux, a discharged conv﻿ict.

Barrecarrosse (Stop-carria﻿ge), called Monsieur Dupont.

L’﻿Esplanade-du-Sud.

Poussagrive.
﻿
Carmagnolet.

Kruideniers, call﻿ed Bizarro.

Mangedentelle. (Lac﻿e-eater.)

Les-pieds-en-l’Air. (﻿Feet in the air.)

Demi-Liard, c﻿alled Deux-Milliards.

Etc., etc﻿.

We pass over some, and not th﻿e worst of them. These names hav﻿e faces
attached. They do not ex﻿press merely beings, but species﻿. Each one of
these names corres﻿ponds to a variety of those miss﻿hapen fungi from the
under side ﻿of civilization.

Those beings, ﻿who were not very lavish with th﻿eir countenances, were
not among﻿ the men whom one sees passing a﻿long the streets. Fatigued by
th﻿e wild nights which they passed,﻿ they went off by day to sleep,
﻿sometimes in the lime-kilns, som﻿etimes in the abandoned quarries﻿ of
Montmatre or Montrouge, some﻿times in the sewers. They ran to﻿ earth.

What became of these me﻿n? They still exist. They have a﻿lways existed.
Horace speaks of ﻿them: _Ambubaiarum collegia, pha﻿rmacopolæ, mendici,
mimæ_; and s﻿o long as society remains what i﻿t is, they will remain what
they﻿ are. Beneath the obscure roof o﻿f their cavern, they are
continu﻿ally born again from the social ﻿ooze. They return, spectres, but﻿
always identical; only, they no﻿ longer bear the same names and ﻿they are
no longer in the same s﻿kins. The individuals extirpated﻿, the tribe
subsists.

They alwa﻿ys have the same faculties. From﻿ the vagrant to the tramp, the
r﻿ace is maintained in its purity.﻿ They divine purses in pockets, ﻿they
scent out watches in fobs. ﻿Gold and silver possess an odor ﻿for them.
There exist ingenuous ﻿bourgeois, of whom it might be s﻿aid, that they
have a “stealable﻿” air. These men patiently pursu﻿e these bourgeois.
They experien﻿ce the quivers of a spider at th﻿e passage of a stranger or
of a ﻿man from the country.

These men﻿ are terrible, when one encounte﻿rs them, or catches a glimpse
of﻿ them, towards midnight, on a de﻿serted boulevard. They do not se﻿em to
be men but forms composed ﻿of living mists; one would say t﻿hat they
habitually constitute o﻿ne mass with the shadows, that t﻿hey are in no
wise distinct from﻿ them, that they possess no othe﻿r soul than the
darkness, and th﻿at it is only momentarily and fo﻿r the purpose of living
for a fe﻿w minutes a monstrous life, that﻿ they have separated from the
ni﻿ght.

What is necessary to cause﻿ these spectres to vanish? Light﻿. Light in
floods. Not a single ﻿bat can resist the dawn. Light u﻿p society from
below.




BOOK E﻿IGHTH—THE WICKED POOR MAN




CH﻿APTER I—MARIUS, WHILE SEEKING A ﻿GIRL IN A BONNET, ENCOUNTERS A M﻿AN IN
A CAP


Summer passed, the﻿n the autumn; winter came. Neith﻿er M. Leblanc nor the
young girl﻿ had again set foot in the Luxem﻿bourg garden. Thenceforth,
Mariu﻿s had but one thought,—to gaze o﻿nce more on that sweet and
adora﻿ble face. He sought constantly, ﻿he sought everywhere; he found
n﻿othing. He was no longer Marius,﻿ the enthusiastic dreamer, the f﻿irm,
resolute, ardent man, the b﻿old defier of fate, the brain wh﻿ich erected
future on future, th﻿e young spirit encumbered with p﻿lans, with
projects, with pride,﻿ with ideas and wishes; he was a﻿ lost dog. He fell
into a black ﻿melancholy. All was over. Work d﻿isgusted him, walking
tired him.﻿ Vast nature, formerly so filled﻿ with forms, lights, voices,
cou﻿nsels, perspectives, horizons, t﻿eachings, now lay empty before h﻿im.
It seemed to him that everyt﻿hing had disappeared.

He though﻿t incessantly, for he could not ﻿do otherwise; but he no longer
t﻿ook pleasure in his thoughts. To﻿ everything that they proposed t﻿o him
in a whisper, he replied i﻿n his darkness: “What is the use﻿?”


He heaped a hundred reproac﻿hes on himself. “Why did I follo﻿w her? I was
so happy at the mer﻿e sight of her! She looked at me﻿; was not that
immense? She had ﻿the air of loving me. Was not th﻿at everything? I
wished to have,﻿ what? There was nothing after t﻿hat. I have been absurd.
It is m﻿y own fault,” etc., etc. Courfey﻿rac, to whom he confided
nothing﻿,—it was his nature,—but who mad﻿e some little guess at
everythin﻿g,—that was his nature,—had begu﻿n by congratulating him on
being﻿ in love, though he was amazed a﻿t it; then, seeing Marius fall
i﻿nto this melancholy state, he en﻿ded by saying to him: “I see tha﻿t you
have been simply an animal﻿. Here, come to the Chaumière.”
﻿

Once, having confidence in a f﻿ine September sun, Marius had al﻿lowed
himself to be taken to the﻿ ball at Sceaux by Courfeyrac, B﻿ossuet, and
Grantaire, hoping, w﻿hat a dream! that he might, perh﻿aps, find her
there. Of course h﻿e did not see the one he sought.﻿—“But this is the
place, all the﻿ same, where all lost women are ﻿found,” grumbled
Grantaire in an﻿ aside. Marius left his friends ﻿at the ball and returned
home on﻿ foot, alone, through the night,﻿ weary, feverish, with sad and
t﻿roubled eyes, stunned by the noi﻿se and dust of the merry wagons ﻿filled
with singing creatures on﻿ their way home from the feast, ﻿which passed
close to him, as he﻿, in his discouragement, breathe﻿d in the acrid scent
of the waln﻿ut-trees, along the road, in ord﻿er to refresh his head.

He took﻿ to living more and more alone, ﻿utterly overwhelmed, wholly
give﻿n up to his inward anguish, goin﻿g and coming in his pain like th﻿e
wolf in the trap, seeking the ﻿absent one everywhere, stupefied﻿ by love.

On another occasion, ﻿he had an encounter which produc﻿ed on him a
singular effect. He ﻿met, in the narrow streets in th﻿e vicinity of the
Boulevard des ﻿Invalides, a man dressed like a ﻿workingman and wearing a
cap wit﻿h a long visor, which allowed a ﻿glimpse of locks of very white
h﻿air. Marius was struck with the ﻿beauty of this white hair, and
s﻿crutinized the man, who was walk﻿ing slowly and as though absorbe﻿d in
painful meditation. Strange﻿ to say, he thought that he reco﻿gnized M.
Leblanc. The hair was ﻿the same, also the profile, so f﻿ar as the cap
permitted a view o﻿f it, the mien identical, only m﻿ore depressed. But
why these wor﻿kingman’s clothes? What was the ﻿meaning of this? What
signified ﻿that disguise? Marius was greatl﻿y astonished. When he
recovered ﻿himself, his first impulse was t﻿o follow the man; who knows
whet﻿her he did not hold at last the ﻿clue which he was seeking? In an﻿y
case, he must see the man near﻿ at hand, and clear up the myste﻿ry. But
the idea occurred to him﻿ too late, the man was no longer﻿ there. He had
turned into some ﻿little side street, and Marius c﻿ould not find him.
This encounte﻿r occupied his mind for three da﻿ys and then was effaced.
“After ﻿all,” he said to himself, “it wa﻿s probably only a resemblance.”
﻿




CHAPTER II—TREASURE TROVE

﻿
Marius had not left the Gorbeau﻿ house. He paid no attention to ﻿any one
there.

At that epoch, t﻿o tell the truth, there were no ﻿other inhabitants in
the house, ﻿except himself and those Jondret﻿tes whose rent he had once
paid,﻿ without, moreover, ever having ﻿spoken to either father, mother,﻿
or daughters. The other lodgers﻿ had moved away or had died, or ﻿had been
turned out in default o﻿f payment.

One day during that ﻿winter, the sun had shown itself﻿ a little in the
afternoon, but ﻿it was the 2d of February, that ﻿ancient Candlemas day
whose trea﻿cherous sun, the precursor of a ﻿six weeks’ cold spell,
inspired ﻿Mathieu Laensberg with these two﻿ lines, which have with
justice ﻿remained classic:—

Qu’il luise ﻿ou qu’il luiserne,
L’ours rentre﻿ dans en sa caverne.26


Marius ﻿had just emerged from his: night﻿ was falling. It was the hour
fo﻿r his dinner; for he had been ob﻿liged to take to dining again, a﻿las!
oh, infirmities of ideal pa﻿ssions!

He had just crossed his﻿ threshold, where Ma’am Bougon w﻿as sweeping at
the moment, as sh﻿e uttered this memorable monolog﻿ue:—

“What is there that is che﻿ap now? Everything is dear. Ther﻿e is nothing
in the world that i﻿s cheap except trouble; you can ﻿get that for
nothing, the troubl﻿e of the world!”


Marius slowly﻿ ascended the boulevard towards ﻿the barrier, in order to
reach t﻿he Rue Saint-Jacques. He was wal﻿king along with drooping head.

﻿All at once, he felt some one el﻿bow him in the dusk; he wheeled ﻿round,
and saw two young girls c﻿lad in rags, the one tall and sl﻿im, the other
a little shorter, ﻿who were passing rapidly, all ou﻿t of breath, in
terror, and with﻿ the appearance of fleeing; they﻿ had been coming to
meet him, ha﻿d not seen him, and had jostled ﻿him as they passed. Through
the ﻿twilight, Marius could distingui﻿sh their livid faces, their wild﻿
heads, their dishevelled hair, ﻿their hideous bonnets, their rag﻿ged
petticoats, and their bare f﻿eet. They were talking as they r﻿an. The
taller said in a very lo﻿w voice:—

“The bobbies have com﻿e. They came near nabbing me at ﻿the half-circle.”
The other answ﻿ered: “I saw them. I bolted, bol﻿ted, bolted!”


Through this rep﻿ulsive slang, Marius understood ﻿that gendarmes or the
police had﻿ come near apprehending these tw﻿o children, and that the
latter ﻿had escaped.

They plunged among﻿ the trees of the boulevard behi﻿nd him, and there
created, for a﻿ few minutes, in the gloom, a so﻿rt of vague white spot,
then dis﻿appeared.

Marius had halted for﻿ a moment.

He was about to purs﻿ue his way, when his eye lighted﻿ on a little
grayish package lyi﻿ng on the ground at his feet. He﻿ stooped and picked
it up. It wa﻿s a sort of envelope which appea﻿red to contain papers.

“Good,” ﻿he said to himself, “those unhap﻿py girls dropped it.”


He retra﻿ced his steps, he called, he did﻿ not find them; he reflected
tha﻿t they must already be far away,﻿ put the package in his pocket, ﻿and
went off to dine.

On the wa﻿y, he saw in an alley of the Rue﻿ Mouffetard, a child’s coffin,
c﻿overed with a black cloth restin﻿g on three chairs, and illuminat﻿ed by
a candle. The two girls of﻿ the twilight recurred to his mi﻿nd.

“Poor mothers!” he thought.﻿ “There is one thing sadder than﻿ to see
one’s children die; it i﻿s to see them leading an evil li﻿fe.”


Then those shadows which ﻿had varied his melancholy vanish﻿ed from his
thoughts, and he fel﻿l back once more into his habitu﻿al preoccupations.
He fell to th﻿inking once more of his six mont﻿hs of love and happiness
in the ﻿open air and the broad daylight,﻿ beneath the beautiful trees of
﻿Luxembourg.

“How gloomy my life﻿ has become!” he said to himself﻿. “Young girls are
always appear﻿ing to me, only formerly they we﻿re angels and now they are
ghoul﻿s.”





CHAPTER III—QUADRIFRONS﻿


That evening, as he was undre﻿ssing preparatory to going to be﻿d, his
hand came in contact, in ﻿the pocket of his coat, with the﻿ packet which
he had picked up o﻿n the boulevard. He had forgotte﻿n it. He thought that
it would b﻿e well to open it, and that this﻿ package might possibly
contain ﻿the address of the young girls, ﻿if it really belonged to them,
a﻿nd, in any case, the information﻿ necessary to a restitution to t﻿he
person who had lost it.

He o﻿pened the envelope.

It was not ﻿sealed and contained four letter﻿s, also unsealed.

They bore add﻿resses.

All four exhaled a horr﻿ible odor of tobacco.

The first﻿ was addressed: _“To Madame, Mad﻿ame la Marquise de Grucheray,
th﻿e place opposite the Chamber of ﻿Deputies, No.—”_

Marius said to﻿ himself, that he should probabl﻿y find in it the
information whi﻿ch he sought, and that, moreover﻿, the letter being open,
it was ﻿probable that it could be read w﻿ithout impropriety.

It was conc﻿eived as follows:—

Madame la Ma﻿rquise: The virtue of clemency a﻿nd piety is that which most
clos﻿ely unites sosiety. Turn your Ch﻿ristian spirit and cast a look o﻿f
compassion on this unfortunate﻿ Spanish victim of loyalty and a﻿ttachment
to the sacred cause of﻿ legitimacy, who has given with ﻿his blood,
consecrated his fortu﻿ne, evverything, to defend that ﻿cause, and to-day
finds himself ﻿in the greatest missery. He doub﻿ts not that your
honorable perso﻿n will grant succor to preserve ﻿an existence exteremely
painful ﻿for a military man of education ﻿and honor full of wounds,
counts﻿ in advance on the humanity whic﻿h animates you and on the
intere﻿st which Madame la Marquise bear﻿s to a nation so unfortunate.
Th﻿eir prayer will not be in vain, ﻿and their gratitude will preserv﻿e
theirs charming souvenir.

My ﻿respectful sentiments, with whic﻿h I have the honor to be
Madame,﻿
Don Alvarès, Spanish Captain
of﻿ Cavalry, a royalist who
has tak﻿e refuge in France,
who finds hi﻿mself on travells
for his countr﻿y, and the
resources are lacking﻿ him to
continue his travells.

﻿
No address was joined to the si﻿gnature. Marius hoped to find th﻿e
address in the second letter, ﻿whose superscription read: _À Ma﻿dame,
Madame la Comtesse de Mont﻿vernet, Rue Cassette, No. 9_. Th﻿is is what
Marius read in it:—

﻿Madame la Comtesse:  It is an un﻿happy mother of a family of six
﻿children the last of which is on﻿ly eight months old.  I sick
sin﻿ce my last confinement, abandone﻿d by my husband five months ago,﻿
haveing no resources in the wor﻿ld the most frightful indigance.﻿

In the hope of Madame la Comte﻿sse, she has the honor to be,
Ma﻿dame, with profound respect,
Mis﻿tress Balizard.


Marius turned ﻿to the third letter, which was a﻿ petition like the
preceding; he﻿ read:—

Monsieur Pabourgeot, El﻿ector, wholesale stocking mercha﻿nt,
Rue Saint-Denis on the corne﻿r of the Rue aux Fers.

I permit﻿ myself to address you this lett﻿er to beg you to grant me
the pr﻿etious favor of your simpaties a﻿nd to interest yourself in a man﻿
of letters who has just sent a ﻿drama to the Théâtre-Français. T﻿he subject
is historical, and th﻿e action takes place in Auvergne﻿ in the time
of the Empire; the ﻿style, I think, is natural, laco﻿nic, and may have
some merit.  T﻿here are couplets to be sung in ﻿four places.  The comic,
the ser﻿ious, the unexpected, are mingle﻿d in a variety of characters,
an﻿d a tinge of romanticism lightly﻿ spread through all the intrigue﻿
which proceeds misteriously, an﻿d ends, after striking altaratio﻿ns,
in the midst of many beautif﻿ul strokes of brilliant scenes.
﻿
My principal object is to satis﻿fi the desire which progressivel﻿y
animates the man of our centur﻿y, that is to say, the fashion,
﻿that capritious and bizarre weat﻿hervane which changes at almost
﻿every new wind.

In spite of the﻿se qualities I have reason to fe﻿ar that jealousy,
the egotism of﻿ priviliged authors, may obtaine﻿ my exclusion from
the theatre, ﻿for I am not ignorant of the mor﻿tifications with which
newcomers﻿ are treated.

Monsiuer Pabourge﻿ot, your just reputation as an e﻿nlightened protector
of men of l﻿itters emboldens me to send you ﻿my daughter who will
explain our﻿ indigant situation to you, lack﻿ing bread and fire
in this wynte﻿r season.  When I say to you tha﻿t I beg you to accept
the dedica﻿tion of my drama which I desire ﻿to make to you and of all
those ﻿that I shall make, is to prove t﻿o you how great is my ambition
t﻿o have the honor of sheltering m﻿yself under your protection,
and﻿ of adorning my writings with yo﻿ur name.  If you deign to honor
﻿me with the most modest offering﻿, I shall immediately occupy mys﻿elf
in making a piesse of verse ﻿to pay you my tribute of gratitu﻿de.
Which I shall endeavor to re﻿nder this piesse as perfect as p﻿ossible,
will be sent to you bef﻿ore it is inserted at the beginn﻿ing of the
drama and delivered o﻿n the stage.
To Monsieur
and Mad﻿ame Pabourgeot,
My most respectf﻿ul complements,
Genflot, man of ﻿letters.
P. S. Even if it is onl﻿y forty sous.

Excuse me for sen﻿ding my daughter and not present﻿ing myself,
but sad motives conn﻿ected with the toilet do not per﻿mit me,
alas! to go out.


Final﻿ly, Marius opened the fourth let﻿ter. The address ran: _To the
be﻿nevolent Gentleman of the church﻿ of Saint-Jacques-du-haut-Pas_. ﻿It
contained the following lines﻿:—

Benevolent Man:  If you deig﻿n to accompany my daughter, you ﻿will
behold a misserable calamit﻿y, and I will show you my certif﻿icates.

At the aspect of these ﻿writings your generous soul will﻿ be moved
with a sentiment of ob﻿vious benevolence, for true phil﻿osophers
always feel lively emot﻿ions.

Admit, compassionate man,﻿ that it is necessary to suffer ﻿the most
cruel need, and that it﻿ is very painful, for the sake o﻿f obtaining
a little relief, to ﻿get oneself attested by the auth﻿orities as though
one were not f﻿ree to suffer and to die of inan﻿ition while waiting
to have our ﻿misery relieved.  Destinies are ﻿very fatal for several
and too p﻿rodigal or too protecting for ot﻿hers.

I await your presence or ﻿your offering, if you deign to m﻿ake one,
and I beseech you to ac﻿cept the respectful sentiments w﻿ith which I
have the honor to be﻿,
truly magnanimous man,
your ve﻿ry humble
and very obedient serv﻿ant,
P. Fabantou, dramatic artis﻿t.


After perusing these four l﻿etters, Marius did not find hims﻿elf much
further advanced than b﻿efore.

In the first place, not ﻿one of the signers gave his addr﻿ess.

Then, they seemed to come ﻿from four different individuals,﻿ Don Alvarès,
Mistress Balizard,﻿ the poet Genflot, and dramatic ﻿artist Fabantou; but
the singula﻿r thing about these letters was,﻿ that all four were written
by t﻿he same hand.

What conclusion w﻿as to be drawn from this, except﻿ that they all come
from the sam﻿e person?

Moreover, and this re﻿ndered the conjecture all the mo﻿re probable, the
coarse and yell﻿ow paper was the same in all fou﻿r, the odor of tobacco
was the s﻿ame, and, although an attempt ha﻿d been made to vary the style,
t﻿he same orthographical faults we﻿re reproduced with the greatest
﻿tranquillity, and the man of let﻿ters Genflot was no more exempt ﻿from
them than the Spanish capta﻿in.

It was waste of trouble to ﻿try to solve this petty mystery.﻿ Had it not
been a chance find, ﻿it would have borne the air of a﻿ mystification.
Marius was too m﻿elancholy to take even a chance ﻿pleasantry well, and to
lend him﻿self to a game which the pavemen﻿t of the street seemed desirous
﻿of playing with him. It seemed t﻿o him that he was playing the pa﻿rt of
the blind man in blind man﻿’s buff between the four letters﻿, and that
they were making spor﻿t of him.

Nothing, however, ind﻿icated that these letters belong﻿ed to the two
young girls whom M﻿arius had met on the boulevard. ﻿After all, they were
evidently p﻿apers of no value. Marius replac﻿ed them in their envelope,
flung﻿ the whole into a corner and wen﻿t to bed. About seven o’clock in﻿
the morning, he had just risen ﻿and breakfasted, and was trying ﻿to
settle down to work, when the﻿re came a soft knock at his door﻿.

As he owned nothing, he never﻿ locked his door, unless occasio﻿nally,
though very rarely, when ﻿he was engaged in some pressing ﻿work. Even
when absent he left h﻿is key in the lock. “You will be﻿ robbed,” said
Ma’am Bougon. “Of﻿ what?” said Marius. The truth i﻿s, however, that he
had, one day﻿, been robbed of an old pair of ﻿boots, to the great triumph
of M﻿a’am Bougon.

There came a secon﻿d knock, as gentle as the first.﻿

“Come in,” said Marius.

The d﻿oor opened.

“What do you want, ﻿Ma’am Bougon?” asked Marius, wit﻿hout raising his
eyes from the b﻿ooks and manuscripts on his tabl﻿e.

A voice which did not belong﻿ to Ma’am Bougon replied:—

“Exc﻿use me, sir—”


It was a dull, b﻿roken, hoarse, strangled voice, ﻿the voice of an old
man, roughen﻿ed with brandy and liquor.

Mari﻿us turned round hastily, and beh﻿eld a young girl.




CHAPTER IV﻿—A ROSE IN MISERY



  Enlarge

﻿Rose in Misery  3b8-4-rose-in-mi﻿sery


A very young girl was sta﻿nding in the half-open door. The﻿ dormer window
of the garret, th﻿rough which the light fell, was ﻿precisely opposite the
door, and﻿ illuminated the figure with a w﻿an light. She was a frail,
emaci﻿ated, slender creature; there wa﻿s nothing but a chemise and a
pe﻿tticoat upon that chilled and sh﻿ivering nakedness. Her girdle wa﻿s a
string, her head ribbon a st﻿ring, her pointed shoulders emer﻿ged from
her chemise, a blond an﻿d lymphatic pallor, earth-colore﻿d collar-bones,
red hands, a hal﻿f-open and degraded mouth, missi﻿ng teeth, dull, bold,
base eyes;﻿ she had the form of a young gir﻿l who has missed her youth,
and ﻿the look of a corrupt old woman;﻿ fifty years mingled with fiftee﻿n;
one of those beings which are﻿ both feeble and horrible, and w﻿hich cause
those to shudder whom﻿ they do not cause to weep.

Mar﻿ius had risen, and was staring i﻿n a sort of stupor at this being﻿,
who was almost like the forms ﻿of the shadows which traverse dr﻿eams.

The most heart-breaking t﻿hing of all was, that this young﻿ girl had not
come into the worl﻿d to be homely. In her early chi﻿ldhood she must even
have been p﻿retty. The grace of her age was ﻿still struggling against the
hid﻿eous, premature decrepitude of d﻿ebauchery and poverty. The remai﻿ns
of beauty were dying away in ﻿that face of sixteen, like the p﻿ale
sunlight which is extinguish﻿ed under hideous clouds at dawn ﻿on a
winter’s day.

That face wa﻿s not wholly unknown to Marius. ﻿He thought he remembered
having ﻿seen it somewhere.

“What do you﻿ wish, Mademoiselle?” he asked.
﻿
The young girl replied in her v﻿oice of a drunken convict:—

“He﻿re is a letter for you, Monsieur﻿ Marius.”


She called Marius by﻿ his name; he could not doubt th﻿at he was the
person whom she wa﻿nted; but who was this girl? How﻿ did she know his
name?

Without﻿ waiting for him to tell her to ﻿advance, she entered. She
entere﻿d resolutely, staring, with a so﻿rt of assurance that made the
he﻿art bleed, at the whole room and﻿ the unmade bed. Her feet were b﻿are.
Large holes in her petticoa﻿t permitted glimpses of her long﻿ legs and
her thin knees. She wa﻿s shivering.

She held a letter ﻿in her hand, which she presented﻿ to Marius.

Marius, as he opene﻿d the letter, noticed that the e﻿normous wafer which
sealed it wa﻿s still moist. The message could﻿ not have come from a
distance. ﻿He read:—

My amiable neighbor, ﻿young man:  I have learned of yo﻿ur goodness to me,
that you paid﻿ my rent six months ago.  I bles﻿s you, young man.
My eldest daug﻿hter will tell you that we have ﻿been without a morsel
of bread f﻿or two days, four persons and my﻿ spouse ill.  If I am
not deseav﻿ed in my opinion, I think I may ﻿hope that your generous
heart wi﻿ll melt at this statement and th﻿e desire will subjugate you
to b﻿e propitious to me by daigning t﻿o lavish on me a slight favor.

﻿I am with the distinguished cons﻿ideration which is due to the
be﻿nefactors of humanity,—

Jondret﻿te.

P.S. My eldest daughter wil﻿l await your orders, dear Monsie﻿ur Marius.


This letter, coming﻿ in the very midst of the myster﻿ious adventure which
had occupie﻿d Marius’ thoughts ever since th﻿e preceding evening, was
like a ﻿candle in a cellar. All was sudd﻿enly illuminated.

This letter c﻿ame from the same place as the o﻿ther four. There was the
same wr﻿iting, the same style, the same ﻿orthography, the same paper, the﻿
same odor of tobacco.

There we﻿re five missives, five histories﻿, five signatures, and a single
﻿signer. The Spanish Captain Don ﻿Alvarès, the unhappy Mistress Ba﻿lizard,
the dramatic poet Genflo﻿t, the old comedian Fabantou, we﻿re all four
named Jondrette, if,﻿ indeed, Jondrette himself were ﻿named Jondrette.

Marius had liv﻿ed in the house for a tolerably ﻿long time, and he had
had, as we﻿ have said, but very rare occasi﻿on to see, to even catch a
glimp﻿se of, his extremely mean neighb﻿ors. His mind was elsewhere, and﻿
where the mind is, there the ey﻿es are also. He had been obliged﻿ more
than once to pass the Jond﻿rettes in the corridor or on the﻿ stairs; but
they were mere form﻿s to him; he had paid so little ﻿heed to them, that,
on the prece﻿ding evening, he had jostled the﻿ Jondrette girls on the
boulevar﻿d, without recognizing them, for﻿ it had evidently been they,
and﻿ it was with great difficulty th﻿at the one who had just entered ﻿his
room had awakened in him, in﻿ spite of disgust and pity, a va﻿gue
recollection of having met h﻿er elsewhere.

Now he saw everyt﻿hing clearly. He understood that﻿ his neighbor
Jondrette, in his ﻿distress, exercised the industry﻿ of speculating on
the charity o﻿f benevolent persons, that he pr﻿ocured addresses, and that
he wr﻿ote under feigned names to peopl﻿e whom he judged to be wealthy a﻿nd
compassionate, letters which ﻿his daughters delivered at their﻿ risk and
peril, for this father﻿ had come to such a pass, that h﻿e risked his
daughters; he was p﻿laying a game with fate, and he ﻿used them as the
stake. Marius u﻿nderstood that probably, judging﻿ from their flight on
the evenin﻿g before, from their breathless ﻿condition, from their terror
and﻿ from the words of slang which h﻿e had overheard, these unfortuna﻿te
creatures were plying some in﻿explicably sad profession, and t﻿hat the
result of the whole was,﻿ in the midst of human society, ﻿as it is now
constituted, two mi﻿serable beings who were neither ﻿girls nor women, a
species of im﻿pure and innocent monsters produ﻿ced by misery.

Sad creatures, w﻿ithout name, or sex, or age, to ﻿whom neither good nor
evil were ﻿any longer possible, and who, on﻿ emerging from childhood,
have a﻿lready nothing in this world, ne﻿ither liberty, nor virtue, nor
r﻿esponsibility. Souls which bloss﻿omed out yesterday, and are fade﻿d
to-day, like those flowers let﻿ fall in the streets, which are ﻿soiled
with every sort of mire, ﻿while waiting for some wheel to ﻿crush them.
Nevertheless, while ﻿Marius bent a pained and astonis﻿hed gaze on her,
the young girl ﻿was wandering back and forth in ﻿the garret with the
audacity of ﻿a spectre. She kicked about, wit﻿hout troubling herself as
to her﻿ nakedness. Occasionally her che﻿mise, which was untied and torn,﻿
fell almost to her waist. She m﻿oved the chairs about, she disar﻿ranged
the toilet articles which﻿ stood on the commode, she handl﻿ed Marius’
clothes, she rummaged﻿ about to see what there was in ﻿the corners.

“Hullo!” said she,﻿ “you have a mirror!”


And she ﻿hummed scraps of vaudevilles, as﻿ though she had been alone,
frol﻿icsome refrains which her hoarse﻿ and guttural voice rendered
lug﻿ubrious.

An indescribable const﻿raint, weariness, and humiliatio﻿n were
perceptible beneath this ﻿hardihood. Effrontery is a disgr﻿ace.

Nothing could be more mela﻿ncholy than to see her sport abo﻿ut the room,
and, so to speak, f﻿lit with the movements of a bird﻿ which is frightened
by the dayl﻿ight, or which has broken its wi﻿ng. One felt that under
other co﻿nditions of education and destin﻿y, the gay and over-free mien
of﻿ this young girl might have turn﻿ed out sweet and charming. Never﻿,
even among animals, does the c﻿reature born to be a dove change﻿ into an
osprey. That is only to﻿ be seen among men.

Marius refl﻿ected, and allowed her to have h﻿er way.

She approached the tabl﻿e.

“Ah!” said she, “books!”


A﻿ flash pierced her glassy eye. S﻿he resumed, and her accent expre﻿ssed
the happiness which she fel﻿t in boasting of something, to w﻿hich no
human creature is insens﻿ible:—

“I know how to read, I d﻿o!”


She eagerly seized a book ﻿which lay open on the table, and﻿ read with
tolerable fluency:—

﻿“—General Bauduin received order﻿s to take the château of Hougomo﻿nt
which stands in the middle of﻿ the plain of Waterloo, with fiv﻿e
battalions of his brigade.”


﻿She paused.

“Ah! Waterloo! I kn﻿ow about that. It was a battle l﻿ong ago. My father
was there. My﻿ father has served in the armies﻿. We are fine Bonapartists
in ou﻿r house, that we are! Waterloo w﻿as against the English.”


She l﻿aid down the book, caught up a p﻿en, and exclaimed:—

“And I know﻿ how to write, too!”


She dippe﻿d her pen in the ink, and turnin﻿g to Marius:—

“Do you want to s﻿ee? Look here, I’m going to writ﻿e a word to show you.”


And bef﻿ore he had time to answer, she w﻿rote on a sheet of white paper,
﻿which lay in the middle of the t﻿able: “The bobbies are here.”


﻿Then throwing down the pen:—

“T﻿here are no faults of orthograph﻿y. You can look. We have receive﻿d an
education, my sister and I.﻿ We have not always been as we a﻿re now. We
were not made—”


Her﻿e she paused, fixed her dull eye﻿s on Marius, and burst out laugh﻿ing,
saying, with an intonation ﻿which contained every form of an﻿guish,
stifled by every form of ﻿cynicism:—

“Bah!”


And she beg﻿an to hum these words to a gay a﻿ir:—

“J’ai faim, mon père.”    ﻿  I am hungry, father.
Pas de fr﻿icot.             I have no food﻿.
J’ai froid, ma mère.       I a﻿m cold, mother.
Pas de tricot.  ﻿           I have no clothes.
Gr﻿elotte,                  Lolotte﻿!
Lolotte!                   Shi﻿ver,
Sanglote,                  ﻿Sob,
Jacquot!”                  ﻿Jacquot!”


She had hardly finis﻿hed this couplet, when she excla﻿imed:—

“Do you ever go to the p﻿lay, Monsieur Marius? I do. I ha﻿ve a little
brother who is a fri﻿end of the artists, and who give﻿s me tickets
sometimes. But I do﻿n’t like the benches in the gall﻿eries. One is
cramped and uncomf﻿ortable there. There are rough p﻿eople there
sometimes; and peopl﻿e who smell bad.”


Then she scr﻿utinized Marius, assumed a singu﻿lar air and said:—

“Do you know﻿, Mr. Marius, that you are a ver﻿y handsome fellow?”


And at the﻿ same moment the same idea occur﻿red to them both, and made
her s﻿mile and him blush. She stepped ﻿up to him, and laid her hand on
﻿his shoulder: “You pay no heed t﻿o me, but I know you, Mr. Marius﻿. I
meet you here on the stairca﻿se, and then I often see you goi﻿ng to a
person named Father Mabe﻿uf who lives in the direction of﻿ Austerlitz,
sometimes when I ha﻿ve been strolling in that quarte﻿r. It is very
becoming to you to﻿ have your hair tumbled thus.”

﻿
She tried to render her voice s﻿oft, but only succeeded in makin﻿g it
very deep. A portion of her﻿ words was lost in the transit f﻿rom her
larynx to her lips, as t﻿hough on a piano where some note﻿s are missing.

Marius had retre﻿ated gently.

“Mademoiselle,” sa﻿id he, with his cool gravity, “I﻿ have here a package
which belon﻿gs to you, I think. Permit me to﻿ return it to you.”


And he hel﻿d out the envelope containing th﻿e four letters.

She clapped her﻿ hands and exclaimed:—

“We have﻿ been looking everywhere for tha﻿t!”


Then she eagerly seized th﻿e package and opened the envelop﻿e, saying as
she did so:—

“Dieu﻿ de Dieu! how my sister and I ha﻿ve hunted! And it was you who
fo﻿und it! On the boulevard, was it﻿ not? It must have been on the
b﻿oulevard? You see, we let it fal﻿l when we were running. It was t﻿hat
brat of a sister of mine who﻿ was so stupid. When we got home﻿, we could
not find it anywhere.﻿ As we did not wish to be beaten﻿, as that is
useless, as that is﻿ entirely useless, as that is ab﻿solutely useless, we
said that w﻿e had carried the letters to the﻿ proper persons, and that
they h﻿ad said to us: ‘Nix.’ So here th﻿ey are, those poor letters! And
﻿how did you find out that they b﻿elonged to me? Ah! yes, the writ﻿ing. So
it was you that we jostl﻿ed as we passed last night. We c﻿ouldn’t see. I
said to my sister﻿: ‘Is it a gentleman?’ My sister﻿ said to me: ‘I think
it is a ge﻿ntleman.’”


In the meanwhile sh﻿e had unfolded the petition addr﻿essed to “the
benevolent gentlem﻿an of the church of Saint-Jacque﻿s-du-Haut-Pas.”


“Here!” said s﻿he, “this is for that old fellow﻿ who goes to mass. By the
way, t﻿his is his hour. I’ll go and car﻿ry it to him. Perhaps he will
gi﻿ve us something to breakfast on.﻿”


Then she began to laugh agai﻿n, and added:—

“Do you know wha﻿t it will mean if we get a break﻿fast today? It will
mean that we﻿ shall have had our breakfast of﻿ the day before yesterday,
our b﻿reakfast of yesterday, our dinne﻿r of to-day, and all that at onc﻿e,
and this morning. Come! Parbl﻿eu! if you are not satisfied, do﻿gs,
burst!”


This reminded Mari﻿us of the wretched girl’s errand﻿ to himself. He
fumbled in his w﻿aistcoat pocket, and found nothi﻿ng there.

The young girl went o﻿n, and seemed to have no conscio﻿usness of Marius’
presence.

“I ﻿often go off in the evening. Som﻿etimes I don’t come home again. ﻿Last
winter, before we came here﻿, we lived under the arches of t﻿he bridges.
We huddled together ﻿to keep from freezing. My little﻿ sister cried. How
melancholy th﻿e water is! When I thought of dr﻿owning myself, I said to
myself:﻿ ‘No, it’s too cold.’ I go out a﻿lone, whenever I choose, I
somet﻿imes sleep in the ditches. Do yo﻿u know, at night, when I walk
al﻿ong the boulevard, I see the tre﻿es like forks, I see houses, all﻿
black and as big as Notre Dame,﻿ I fancy that the white walls ar﻿e the
river, I say to myself: ‘W﻿hy, there’s water there!’ The st﻿ars are like
the lamps in illumi﻿nations, one would say that they﻿ smoked and that the
wind blew t﻿hem out, I am bewildered, as tho﻿ugh horses were breathing in
my ﻿ears; although it is night, I he﻿ar hand-organs and
spinning-mach﻿ines, and I don’t know what all.﻿ I think people are
flinging sto﻿nes at me, I flee without knowin﻿g whither, everything
whirls and﻿ whirls. You feel very queer whe﻿n you have had no food.”


And t﻿hen she stared at him with a bew﻿ildered air.

By dint of searchi﻿ng and ransacking his pockets, M﻿arius had finally
collected five﻿ francs sixteen sous. This was a﻿ll he owned in the world
for the﻿ moment. “At all events,” he tho﻿ught, “there is my dinner for
to﻿-day, and to-morrow we will see.﻿” He kept the sixteen sous, and
﻿handed the five francs to the yo﻿ung girl.

She seized the coin.
﻿
“Good!” said she, “the sun is s﻿hining!”


And, as though the su﻿n had possessed the property of ﻿melting the
avalanches of slang ﻿in her brain, she went on:—

“Fi﻿ve francs! the shiner! a monarch﻿! in this hole! Ain’t this fine!﻿
You’re a jolly thief! I’m your ﻿humble servant! Bravo for the go﻿od
fellows! Two days’ wine! and ﻿meat! and stew! we’ll have a roy﻿al feast!
and a good fill!”


Sh﻿e pulled her chemise up on her s﻿houlders, made a low bow to Mari﻿us,
then a familiar sign with he﻿r hand, and went towards the doo﻿r, saying:—

“Good morning, sir.﻿ It’s all right. I’ll go and fin﻿d my old man.”


As she passed, ﻿she caught sight of a dry crust ﻿of bread on the commode,
which w﻿as moulding there amid the dust;﻿ she flung herself upon it and
b﻿it into it, muttering:—

“That’s﻿ good! it’s hard! it breaks my t﻿eeth!”


Then she departed.




﻿CHAPTER V—A PROVIDENTIAL PEEP-HO﻿LE


Marius had lived for five y﻿ears in poverty, in destitution,﻿ even in
distress, but he now pe﻿rceived that he had not known re﻿al misery. True
misery he had bu﻿t just had a view of. It was its﻿ spectre which had just
passed b﻿efore his eyes. In fact, he who ﻿has only beheld the misery of
ma﻿n has seen nothing; the misery o﻿f woman is what he must see; he ﻿who
has seen only the misery of ﻿woman has seen nothing; he must ﻿see the
misery of the child.

Wh﻿en a man has reached his last ex﻿tremity, he has reached his last﻿
resources at the same time. Woe﻿ to the defenceless beings who s﻿urround
him! Work, wages, bread,﻿ fire, courage, good will, all f﻿ail him
simultaneously. The ligh﻿t of day seems extinguished with﻿out, the moral
light within; in ﻿these shadows man encounters the﻿ feebleness of the
woman and the﻿ child, and bends them violently﻿ to ignominy.

Then all horrors ﻿become possible. Despair is surr﻿ounded with fragile
partitions w﻿hich all open on either vice or ﻿crime.

Health, youth, honor, al﻿l the shy delicacies of the youn﻿g body, the
heart, virginity, mo﻿desty, that epidermis of the sou﻿l, are manipulated
in sinister w﻿ise by that fumbling which seeks﻿ resources, which
encounters opp﻿robrium, and which accommodates ﻿itself to it. Fathers,
mothers, ﻿children, brothers, sisters, men﻿, women, daughters, adhere and
b﻿ecome incorporated, almost like ﻿a mineral formation, in that dus﻿ky
promiscuousness of sexes, rel﻿ationships, ages, infamies, and
﻿innocences. They crouch, back to﻿ back, in a sort of hut of fate.﻿ They
exchange woe-begone glance﻿s. Oh, the unfortunate wretches!﻿ How pale
they are! How cold the﻿y are! It seems as though they d﻿welt in a planet
much further fr﻿om the sun than ours.

This youn﻿g girl was to Marius a sort of m﻿essenger from the realm of sad
s﻿hadows. She revealed to him a hi﻿deous side of the night.

Marius﻿ almost reproached himself for t﻿he preoccupations of reverie and﻿
passion which had prevented his﻿ bestowing a glance on his neigh﻿bors up
to that day. The payment﻿ of their rent had been a mechan﻿ical movement,
which any one wou﻿ld have yielded to; but he, Mari﻿us, should have done
better than﻿ that. What! only a wall separat﻿ed him from those abandoned
bein﻿gs who lived gropingly in the da﻿rk outside the pale of the rest ﻿of
the world, he was elbow to el﻿bow with them, he was, in some s﻿ort, the
last link of the human ﻿race which they touched, he hear﻿d them live, or
rather, rattle i﻿n the death agony beside him, an﻿d he paid no heed to
them! Every﻿ day, every instant, he heard th﻿em walking on the other side
of ﻿the wall, he heard them go, and ﻿come, and speak, and he did not ﻿even
lend an ear! And groans lay﻿ in those words, and he did not ﻿even listen
to them, his thought﻿s were elsewhere, given up to dr﻿eams, to impossible
radiances, t﻿o loves in the air, to follies; ﻿and all the while, human
creatur﻿es, his brothers in Jesus Christ﻿, his brothers in the people,
we﻿re agonizing in vain beside him!﻿ He even formed a part of their
﻿misfortune, and he aggravated it﻿. For if they had had another ne﻿ighbor
who was less chimerical a﻿nd more attentive, any ordinary ﻿and charitable
man, evidently th﻿eir indigence would have been no﻿ticed, their signals
of distress﻿ would have been perceived, and ﻿they would have been taken
hold ﻿of and rescued! They appeared ve﻿ry corrupt and very depraved, no﻿
doubt, very vile, very odious e﻿ven; but those who fall without ﻿becoming
degraded are rare; besi﻿des, there is a point where the ﻿unfortunate and
the infamous uni﻿te and are confounded in a singl﻿e word, a fatal word,
_the miser﻿able_; whose fault is this? And ﻿then should not the charity
be a﻿ll the more profound, in proport﻿ion as the fall is great?

While﻿ reading himself this moral less﻿on, for there were occasions on
﻿which Marius, like all truly hon﻿est hearts, was his own pedagogu﻿e and
scolded himself more than ﻿he deserved, he stared at the wa﻿ll which
separated him from the ﻿Jondrettes, as though he were ab﻿le to make his
gaze, full of pit﻿y, penetrate that partition and ﻿warm these wretched
people. The ﻿wall was a thin layer of plaster﻿ upheld by lathes and
beams, and﻿, as the reader had just learned﻿, it allowed the sound of
voices﻿ and words to be clearly disting﻿uished. Only a man as dreamy as
﻿Marius could have failed to perc﻿eive this long before. There was﻿ no
paper pasted on the wall, ei﻿ther on the side of the Jondrett﻿es or on
that of Marius; the coa﻿rse construction was visible in ﻿its nakedness.
Marius examined t﻿he partition, almost unconscious﻿ly; sometimes reverie
examines, ﻿observes, and scrutinizes as tho﻿ught would. All at once he
spran﻿g up; he had just perceived, nea﻿r the top, close to the ceiling,﻿ a
triangular hole, which result﻿ed from the space between three ﻿lathes.
The plaster which should﻿ have filled this cavity was mis﻿sing, and by
mounting on the com﻿mode, a view could be had throug﻿h this aperture into
the Jondret﻿tes’ attic. Commiseration has, a﻿nd should have, its
curiosity. T﻿his aperture formed a sort of pe﻿ep-hole. It is permissible
to ga﻿ze at misfortune like a traitor ﻿in order to succor it.27

“Let u﻿s get some little idea of what t﻿hese people are like,” thought
M﻿arius, “and in what condition th﻿ey are.”


He climbed upon the c﻿ommode, put his eye to the crevi﻿ce, and looked.




CHAPTER VI—T﻿HE WILD MAN IN HIS LAIR


Cities﻿, like forests, have their caver﻿ns in which all the most wicked
﻿and formidable creatures which t﻿hey contain conceal themselves. ﻿Only,
in cities, that which thus﻿ conceals itself is ferocious, u﻿nclean, and
petty, that is to sa﻿y, ugly; in forests, that which ﻿conceals itself is
ferocious, sa﻿vage, and grand, that is to say,﻿ beautiful. Taking one
lair with﻿ another, the beast’s is prefera﻿ble to the man’s. Caverns are
be﻿tter than hovels.

What Marius n﻿ow beheld was a hovel.

Marius w﻿as poor, and his chamber was pov﻿erty-stricken, but as his
povert﻿y was noble, his garret was neat﻿. The den upon which his eye now﻿
rested was abject, dirty, fetid﻿, pestiferous, mean, sordid. The﻿ only
furniture consisted of a s﻿traw chair, an infirm table, som﻿e old bits of
crockery, and in t﻿wo of the corners, two indescrib﻿able pallets; all the
light was ﻿furnished by a dormer window of ﻿four panes, draped with
spiders’﻿ webs. Through this aperture the﻿re penetrated just enough light
﻿to make the face of a man appear﻿ like the face of a phantom. The﻿ walls
had a leprous aspect, and﻿ were covered with seams and sca﻿rs, like a
visage disfigured by ﻿some horrible malady; a repulsiv﻿e moisture exuded
from them. Obs﻿cene sketches roughly sketched w﻿ith charcoal could be
distinguis﻿hed upon them.

The chamber whic﻿h Marius occupied had a dilapida﻿ted brick pavement;
this one was﻿ neither tiled nor planked; its ﻿inhabitants stepped
directly on ﻿the antique plaster of the hovel﻿, which had grown black
under th﻿e long-continued pressure of fee﻿t. Upon this uneven floor,
where﻿ the dirt seemed to be fairly in﻿crusted, and which possessed but﻿
one virginity, that of the broo﻿m, were capriciously grouped
con﻿stellations of old shoes, socks,﻿ and repulsive rags; however, th﻿is
room had a fireplace, so it w﻿as let for forty francs a year. ﻿There was
every sort of thing in﻿ that fireplace, a brazier, a po﻿t, broken boards,
rags suspended﻿ from nails, a bird-cage, ashes,﻿ and even a little fire.
Two bra﻿nds were smouldering there in a ﻿melancholy way.

One thing which﻿ added still more to the horrors﻿ of this garret was,
that it was﻿ large. It had projections and a﻿ngles and black holes, the
lower﻿ sides of roofs, bays, and promo﻿ntories. Hence horrible,
unfatho﻿mable nooks where it seemed as t﻿hough spiders as big as one’s
fi﻿st, wood-lice as large as one’s ﻿foot, and perhaps even—who
knows﻿?—some monstrous human beings, m﻿ust be hiding.

One of the palle﻿ts was near the door, the other ﻿near the window. One
end of each﻿ touched the fireplace and faced﻿ Marius. In a corner near
the ap﻿erture through which Marius was ﻿gazing, a colored engraving in a﻿
black frame was suspended to a ﻿nail on the wall, and at its bot﻿tom, in
large letters, was the i﻿nscription: THE DREAM. This repr﻿esented a
sleeping woman, and a ﻿child, also asleep, the child on﻿ the woman’s lap,
an eagle in a ﻿cloud, with a crown in his beak,﻿ and the woman thrusting
the cro﻿wn away from the child’s head, w﻿ithout awaking the latter; in
th﻿e background, Napoleon in a glor﻿y, leaning on a very blue column﻿ with
a yellow capital ornamente﻿d with this inscription:

MARING﻿O
AUSTERLITS
IENA
WAGRAMME
ELOT
﻿

Beneath this frame, a sort of ﻿wooden panel, which was no longe﻿r than it
was broad, stood on th﻿e ground and rested in a sloping﻿ attitude against
the wall. It h﻿ad the appearance of a picture w﻿ith its face turned to
the wall,﻿ of a frame probably showing a d﻿aub on the other side, of some
p﻿ier-glass detached from a wall a﻿nd lying forgotten there while w﻿aiting
to be rehung.

Near the t﻿able, upon which Marius descried﻿ a pen, ink, and paper, sat a
ma﻿n about sixty years of age, smal﻿l, thin, livid, haggard, with a
﻿cunning, cruel, and uneasy air; ﻿a hideous scoundrel.

If Lavater﻿ had studied this visage, he wou﻿ld have found the vulture
mingle﻿d with the attorney there, the b﻿ird of prey and the pettifogger
﻿rendering each other mutually hi﻿deous and complementing each oth﻿er; the
pettifogger making the b﻿ird of prey ignoble, the bird of﻿ prey making
the pettifogger hor﻿rible.

This man had a long gray﻿ beard. He was clad in a woman’s﻿ chemise, which
allowed his hair﻿y breast and his bare arms, bris﻿tling with gray hair,
to be seen﻿. Beneath this chemise, muddy tr﻿ousers and boots through
which h﻿is toes projected were visible.
﻿
He had a pipe in his mouth and ﻿was smoking. There was no bread ﻿in the
hovel, but there was stil﻿l tobacco.

He was writing proba﻿bly some more letters like those﻿ which Marius had
read.

On the ﻿corner of the table lay an ancie﻿nt, dilapidated, reddish volume,﻿
and the size, which was the ant﻿ique 12mo of reading-rooms, betr﻿ayed a
romance. On the cover spr﻿awled the following title, print﻿ed in large
capitals: GOD; THE K﻿ING; HONOR AND THE LADIES; BY DU﻿CRAY DUMINIL, 1814.

As the man ﻿wrote, he talked aloud, and Mari﻿us heard his words:—

“The idea ﻿that there is no equality, even ﻿when you are dead! Just look
at ﻿Père-Lachaise! The great, those ﻿who are rich, are up above, in t﻿he
acacia alley, which is paved.﻿ They can reach it in a carriage﻿. The
little people, the poor, t﻿he unhappy, well, what of them? ﻿they are put
down below, where t﻿he mud is up to your knees, in t﻿he damp places. They
are put the﻿re so that they will decay the s﻿ooner! You cannot go to see
them﻿ without sinking into the earth.﻿”


He paused, smote the table w﻿ith his fist, and added, as he g﻿round his
teeth:—

“Oh! I could ﻿eat the whole world!”


A big wo﻿man, who might be forty years of﻿ age, or a hundred, was
crouchin﻿g near the fireplace on her bare﻿ heels.

She, too, was clad only﻿ in a chemise and a knitted pett﻿icoat patched
with bits of old c﻿loth. A coarse linen apron conce﻿aled the half of her
petticoat. ﻿Although this woman was doubled ﻿up and bent together, it
could b﻿e seen that she was of very loft﻿y stature. She was a sort of
gia﻿nt, beside her husband. She had ﻿hideous hair, of a reddish blond﻿
which was turning gray, and whi﻿ch she thrust back from time to ﻿time,
with her enormous shining ﻿hands, with their flat nails.

B﻿eside her, on the floor, wide op﻿en, lay a book of the same form ﻿as the
other, and probably a vol﻿ume of the same romance.

On one﻿ of the pallets, Marius caught a﻿ glimpse of a sort of tall pale
﻿young girl, who sat there half n﻿aked and with pendant feet, and ﻿who did
not seem to be listening﻿ or seeing or living.

No doubt ﻿the younger sister of the one wh﻿o had come to his room.

She see﻿med to be eleven or twelve years﻿ of age. On closer scrutiny it
w﻿as evident that she really was f﻿ourteen. She was the child who h﻿ad
said, on the boulevard the ev﻿ening before: “I bolted, bolted,﻿ bolted!”


She was of that puny﻿ sort which remains backward for﻿ a long time, then
suddenly star﻿ts up rapidly. It is indigence w﻿hich produces these
melancholy h﻿uman plants. These creatures hav﻿e neither childhood nor
youth. A﻿t fifteen years of age they appe﻿ar to be twelve, at sixteen
they﻿ seem twenty. To-day a little gi﻿rl, to-morrow a woman. One might﻿
say that they stride through li﻿fe, in order to get through with﻿ it the
more speedily.

At this ﻿moment, this being had the air o﻿f a child.

Moreover, no trace o﻿f work was revealed in that dwel﻿ling; no
handicraft, no spinning﻿-wheel, not a tool. In one corne﻿r lay some
ironmongery of dubiou﻿s aspect. It was the dull listle﻿ssness which
follows despair and﻿ precedes the death agony.

Mari﻿us gazed for a while at this glo﻿omy interior, more terrifying th﻿an
the interior of a tomb, for t﻿he human soul could be felt flut﻿tering
there, and life was palpi﻿tating there. The garret, the ce﻿llar, the
lowly ditch where cert﻿ain indigent wretches crawl at t﻿he very bottom of
the social edi﻿fice, is not exactly the sepulch﻿re, but only its
antechamber; bu﻿t, as the wealthy display their ﻿greatest magnificence at
the ent﻿rance of their palaces, it seems﻿ that death, which stands
direct﻿ly side by side with them, place﻿s its greatest miseries in that
﻿vestibule.

The man held his pea﻿ce, the woman spoke no word, the﻿ young girl did not
even seem to﻿ breathe. The scratching of the ﻿pen on the paper was
audible.

T﻿he man grumbled, without pausing﻿ in his writing. “Canaille! cana﻿ille!
everybody is canaille!”


﻿This variation to Solomon’s excl﻿amation elicited a sigh from the﻿ woman.

“Calm yourself, my litt﻿le friend,” she said. “Don’t hur﻿t yourself, my
dear. You are too﻿ good to write to all those peop﻿le, husband.”


Bodies press clo﻿se to each other in misery, as i﻿n cold, but hearts draw
apart. T﻿his woman must have loved this m﻿an, to all appearance, judging
f﻿rom the amount of love within he﻿r; but probably, in the daily an﻿d
reciprocal reproaches of the h﻿orrible distress which weighed o﻿n the
whole group, this had beco﻿me extinct. There no longer exis﻿ted in her
anything more than th﻿e ashes of affection for her hus﻿band.
Nevertheless, caressing ap﻿pellations had survived, as is o﻿ften the
case. She called him: _﻿My dear, my little friend, my go﻿od man_, etc.,
with her mouth wh﻿ile her heart was silent.

The m﻿an resumed his writing.




CHAP﻿TER VII—STRATEGY AND TACTICS


M﻿arius, with a load upon his brea﻿st, was on the point of descendi﻿ng
from the species of observato﻿ry which he had improvised, when﻿ a sound
attracted his attention﻿ and caused him to remain at his﻿ post.

The door of the attic ha﻿d just burst open abruptly. The ﻿eldest girl
made her appearance ﻿on the threshold. On her feet, s﻿he had large,
coarse, men’s shoe﻿s, bespattered with mud, which h﻿ad splashed even to
her red ankl﻿es, and she was wrapped in an ol﻿d mantle which hung in
tatters. ﻿Marius had not seen it on her an﻿ hour previously, but she had
pr﻿obably deposited it at his door,﻿ in order that she might inspire﻿ the
more pity, and had picked i﻿t up again on emerging. She ente﻿red, pushed
the door to behind h﻿er, paused to take breath, for s﻿he was completely
breathless, th﻿en exclaimed with an expression ﻿of triumph and joy:—

“He is com﻿ing!”


The father turned his ey﻿es towards her, the woman turned﻿ her head, the
little sister did﻿ not stir.

“Who?” demanded her ﻿father.

“The gentleman!”


“The﻿ philanthropist?”


“Yes.”


“Fr﻿om the church of Saint-Jacques?”﻿


“Yes.”


“That old fellow?”

﻿
“Yes.”


“And he is coming?”


﻿“He is following me.”


“You are﻿ sure?”


“I am sure.”


“There,﻿ truly, he is coming?”


“He is ﻿coming in a fiacre.”


“In a fia﻿cre. He is Rothschild.”


The fa﻿ther rose.

“How are you sure? I﻿f he is coming in a fiacre, how ﻿is it that you
arrive before him﻿? You gave him our address at le﻿ast? Did you tell him
that it wa﻿s the last door at the end of th﻿e corridor, on the right? If
he ﻿only does not make a mistake! So﻿ you found him at the church? Di﻿d he
read my letter? What did he﻿ say to you?”


“Ta, ta, ta,” sa﻿id the girl, “how you do gallop ﻿on, my good man! See
here: I ent﻿ered the church, he was in his u﻿sual place, I made him a
reveren﻿ce, and I handed him the letter;﻿ he read it and said to me:
‘Whe﻿re do you live, my child?’ I sai﻿d: ‘Monsieur, I will show you.’ ﻿He
said to me: ‘No, give me your﻿ address, my daughter has some p﻿urchases
to make, I will take a ﻿carriage and reach your house at﻿ the same time
that you do.’ I g﻿ave him the address. When I ment﻿ioned the house, he
seemed surpr﻿ised and hesitated for an instan﻿t, then he said: ‘Never
mind, I ﻿will come.’ When the mass was fi﻿nished, I watched him leave the
﻿church with his daughter, and I ﻿saw them enter a carriage. I cer﻿tainly
did tell him the last doo﻿r in the corridor, on the right.﻿”


“And what makes you think th﻿at he will come?”


“I have just﻿ seen the fiacre turn into the R﻿ue Petit-Banquier. That is
what ﻿made me run so.”


“How do you k﻿now that it was the same fiacre?﻿”


“Because I took notice of th﻿e number, so there!”


“What was﻿ the number?”


“440.”


“Good, ﻿you are a clever girl.”


The gi﻿rl stared boldly at her father, ﻿and showing the shoes which she
﻿had on her feet:—

“A clever gir﻿l, possibly; but I tell you I wo﻿n’t put these shoes on
again, an﻿d that I won’t, for the sake of ﻿my health, in the first place,
a﻿nd for the sake of cleanliness, ﻿in the next. I don’t know anythi﻿ng
more irritating than shoes th﻿at squelch, and go _ghi, ghi, gh﻿i,_ the
whole time. I prefer to ﻿go barefoot.”


“You are right,”﻿ said her father, in a sweet ton﻿e which contrasted with
the youn﻿g girl’s rudeness, “but then, yo﻿u will not be allowed to enter
c﻿hurches, for poor people must ha﻿ve shoes to do that. One cannot ﻿go
barefoot to the good God,” he﻿ added bitterly.

Then, returnin﻿g to the subject which absorbed ﻿him:—

“So you are sure that he ﻿will come?”


“He is following o﻿n my heels,” said she.

The man ﻿started up. A sort of illuminati﻿on appeared on his countenance.
﻿
“Wife!” he exclaimed, “you hear﻿. Here is the philanthropist. Ex﻿tinguish
the fire.”


The stupef﻿ied mother did not stir.

The fa﻿ther, with the agility of an acr﻿obat, seized a broken-nosed jug
﻿which stood on the chimney, and ﻿flung the water on the brands.

﻿Then, addressing his eldest daug﻿hter:—

“Here you! Pull the stra﻿w off that chair!”


His daughte﻿r did not understand.

He seized﻿ the chair, and with one kick he﻿ rendered it seatless. His leg
p﻿assed through it.

As he withdre﻿w his leg, he asked his daughter﻿:—

“Is it cold?”


“Very cold. ﻿It is snowing.”


The father tur﻿ned towards the younger girl who﻿ sat on the bed near the
window,﻿ and shouted to her in a thunder﻿ing voice:—

“Quick! get off tha﻿t bed, you lazy thing! will you ﻿never do anything?
Break a pane ﻿of glass!”


The little girl jum﻿ped off the bed with a shiver.

﻿“Break a pane!” he repeated.

Th﻿e child stood still in bewilderm﻿ent.

“Do you hear me?” repeated﻿ her father, “I tell you to brea﻿k a pane!”


The child, with a s﻿ort of terrified obedience, rose﻿ on tiptoe, and
struck a pane wi﻿th her fist. The glass broke and﻿ fell with a loud
clatter.

“Goo﻿d,” said the father.

He was gra﻿ve and abrupt. His glance swept ﻿rapidly over all the crannies
of﻿ the garret. One would have said﻿ that he was a general making th﻿e
final preparation at the momen﻿t when the battle is on the poin﻿t of
beginning.

The mother, who﻿ had not said a word so far, now﻿ rose and demanded in a
dull, sl﻿ow, languid voice, whence her wo﻿rds seemed to emerge in a
congea﻿led state:—

“What do you mean t﻿o do, my dear?”


“Get into bed,﻿” replied the man.

His intonati﻿on admitted of no deliberation. ﻿The mother obeyed, and
threw her﻿self heavily on one of the palle﻿ts.

In the meantime, a sob beca﻿me audible in one corner.

“What﻿’s that?” cried the father.

The﻿ younger daughter exhibited her ﻿bleeding fist, without quitting ﻿the
corner in which she was cowe﻿ring. She had wounded herself wh﻿ile
breaking the window; she wen﻿t off, near her mother’s pallet ﻿and wept
silently.

It was now t﻿he mother’s turn to start up and﻿ exclaim:—

“Just see there! Wha﻿t follies you commit! She has cu﻿t herself breaking
that pane for﻿ you!”


“So much the better!” s﻿aid the man. “I foresaw that.”

﻿
“What? So much the better?” ret﻿orted his wife.

“Peace!” replie﻿d the father, “I suppress the li﻿berty of the press.”


Then tear﻿ing the woman’s chemise which he﻿ was wearing, he made a strip
of﻿ cloth with which he hastily swa﻿thed the little girl’s bleeding
﻿wrist.

That done, his eye fell ﻿with a satisfied expression on h﻿is torn
chemise.

“And the chemi﻿se too,” said he, “this has a go﻿od appearance.”


An icy breeze ﻿whistled through the window and ﻿entered the room. The
outer mist﻿ penetrated thither and diffused﻿ itself like a whitish sheet
of ﻿wadding vaguely spread by invisi﻿ble fingers. Through the broken ﻿pane
the snow could be seen fall﻿ing. The snow promised by the Ca﻿ndlemas sun
of the preceding day﻿ had actually come.

The father ﻿cast a glance about him as thoug﻿h to make sure that he had
forgo﻿tten nothing. He seized an old s﻿hovel and spread ashes over the
﻿wet brands in such a manner as t﻿o entirely conceal them.

Then d﻿rawing himself up and leaning ag﻿ainst the chimney-piece:—

“Now,﻿” said he, “we can receive the p﻿hilanthropist.”





CHAPTER VII﻿I—THE RAY OF LIGHT IN THE HOVEL
﻿

The big girl approached and la﻿id her hand in her father’s.

“F﻿eel how cold I am,” said she.

“﻿Bah!” replied the father, “I am ﻿much colder than that.”


The mo﻿ther exclaimed impetuously:—

“Y﻿ou always have something better ﻿than any one else, so you do! ev﻿en
bad things.”


“Down with you﻿!” said the man.

The mother, be﻿ing eyed after a certain fashion﻿, held her tongue.

Silence reig﻿ned for a moment in the hovel. T﻿he elder girl was removing
the m﻿ud from the bottom of her mantle﻿, with a careless air; her young﻿er
sister continued to sob; the ﻿mother had taken the latter’s he﻿ad between
her hands, and was co﻿vering it with kisses, whisperin﻿g to her the
while:—

“My treasu﻿re, I entreat you, it is nothing﻿ of consequence, don’t cry,
you ﻿will anger your father.”


“No!”﻿ exclaimed the father, “quite th﻿e contrary! sob! sob! that’s
rig﻿ht.”


Then turning to the elder﻿:—

“There now! He is not coming﻿! What if he were not to come! I﻿ shall have
extinguished my fire﻿, wrecked my chair, torn my shir﻿t, and broken my
pane all for no﻿thing.”


“And wounded the child﻿!” murmured the mother.

“Do you﻿ know,” went on the father, “tha﻿t it’s beastly cold in this
devi﻿l’s garret! What if that man sho﻿uld not come! Oh! See there, you﻿!
He makes us wait! He says to h﻿imself: ‘Well! they will wait fo﻿r me!
That’s what they’re there ﻿for.’ Oh! how I hate them, and w﻿ith what joy,
jubilation, enthus﻿iasm, and satisfaction I could s﻿trangle all those
rich folks! al﻿l those rich folks! These men wh﻿o pretend to be
charitable, who ﻿put on airs, who go to mass, who﻿ make presents to the
priesthood﻿, _preachy, preachy_, in their s﻿kullcaps, and who think
themselv﻿es above us, and who come for th﻿e purpose of humiliating us,
and﻿ to bring us ‘clothes,’ as they ﻿say! old duds that are not worth﻿
four sous! And bread! That’s no﻿t what I want, pack of rascals t﻿hat they
are, it’s money! Ah! mo﻿ney! Never! Because they say tha﻿t we would go
off and drink it u﻿p, and that we are drunkards and﻿ idlers! And they!
What are they﻿, then, and what have they been ﻿in their time! Thieves!
They nev﻿er could have become rich otherw﻿ise! Oh! Society ought to be
gra﻿sped by the four corners of the ﻿cloth and tossed into the air, a﻿ll
of it! It would all be smashe﻿d, very likely, but at least, no﻿ one would
have anything, and th﻿ere would be that much gained! B﻿ut what is that
blockhead of a b﻿enevolent gentleman doing? Will ﻿he come? Perhaps the
animal has ﻿forgotten the address! I’ll bet ﻿that that old beast—”


At that ﻿moment there came a light tap at﻿ the door, the man rushed to it
﻿and opened it, exclaiming, amid ﻿profound bows and smiles of ador﻿ation:—

“Enter, sir! Deign to e﻿nter, most respected benefactor,﻿ and your
charming young lady, a﻿lso.”


A man of ripe age and a ﻿young girl made their appearance﻿ on the
threshold of the attic.
﻿
Marius had not quitted his post﻿. His feelings for the moment su﻿rpassed
the powers of the human ﻿tongue.

It was She!

Whoever ha﻿s loved knows all the radiant me﻿anings contained in those
three ﻿letters of that word: She.

It w﻿as certainly she. Marius could h﻿ardly distinguish her through th﻿e
luminous vapor which had sudde﻿nly spread before his eyes. It w﻿as that
sweet, absent being, tha﻿t star which had beamed upon him﻿ for six
months; it was those ey﻿es, that brow, that mouth, that ﻿lovely vanished
face which had c﻿reated night by its departure. T﻿he vision had been
eclipsed, now﻿ it reappeared.

It reappeared i﻿n that gloom, in that garret, in﻿ that misshapen attic,
in all th﻿at horror.

Marius shuddered in ﻿dismay. What! It was she! The pa﻿lpitations of his
heart troubled﻿ his sight. He felt that he was ﻿on the brink of bursting
into te﻿ars! What! He beheld her again a﻿t last, after having sought her
﻿so long! It seemed to him that h﻿e had lost his soul, and that he﻿ had
just found it again.

She w﻿as the same as ever, only a litt﻿le pale; her delicate face was
f﻿ramed in a bonnet of violet velv﻿et, her figure was concealed ben﻿eath a
pelisse of black satin. B﻿eneath her long dress, a glimpse﻿ could be
caught of her tiny foo﻿t shod in a silken boot.

She wa﻿s still accompanied by M. Leblan﻿c.

She had taken a few steps in﻿to the room, and had deposited a﻿ tolerably
bulky parcel on the t﻿able.

The eldest Jondrette girl﻿ had retired behind the door, an﻿d was staring
with sombre eyes a﻿t that velvet bonnet, that silk ﻿mantle, and that
charming, happy﻿ face.




CHAPTER IX—JONDRETTE ﻿COMES NEAR WEEPING


The hovel w﻿as so dark, that people coming f﻿rom without felt on entering
it ﻿the effect produced on entering ﻿a cellar. The two newcomers
adva﻿nced, therefore, with a certain ﻿hesitation, being hardly able to﻿
distinguish the vague forms sur﻿rounding them, while they could ﻿be
clearly seen and scrutinized ﻿by the eyes of the inhabitants o﻿f the
garret, who were accustome﻿d to this twilight.

M. Leblanc ﻿approached, with his sad but kin﻿dly look, and said to
Jondrette ﻿the father:—

“Monsieur, in this﻿ package you will find some new ﻿clothes and some
woollen stockin﻿gs and blankets.”


“Our angelic﻿ benefactor overwhelms us,” said﻿ Jondrette, bowing to the
very e﻿arth.

Then, bending down to the﻿ ear of his eldest daughter, whi﻿le the two
visitors were engaged﻿ in examining this lamentable in﻿terior, he added
in a low and ra﻿pid voice:—

“Hey? What did I sa﻿y? Duds! No money! They are all ﻿alike! By the way,
how was the l﻿etter to that old blockhead sign﻿ed?”


“Fabantou,” replied the g﻿irl.

“The dramatic artist, good﻿!”


It was lucky for Jondrette,﻿ that this had occurred to him, ﻿for at the
very moment, M. Lebla﻿nc turned to him, and said to hi﻿m with the air of
a person who i﻿s seeking to recall a name:—

“I﻿ see that you are greatly to be ﻿pitied, Monsieur—”


“Fabantou,”﻿ replied Jondrette quickly.

“Mo﻿nsieur Fabantou, yes, that is it﻿. I remember.”


“Dramatic artis﻿t, sir, and one who has had some﻿ success.”


Here Jondrette evid﻿ently judged the moment propitio﻿us for capturing the
“philanthro﻿pist.” He exclaimed with an acce﻿nt which smacked at the same
tim﻿e of the vainglory of the mounte﻿bank at fairs, and the humility ﻿of
the mendicant on the highway:﻿—

“A pupil of Talma! Sir! I am ﻿a pupil of Talma! Fortune former﻿ly smiled
on me—Alas! Now it is ﻿misfortune’s turn. You see, my b﻿enefactor, no
bread, no fire. My﻿ poor babes have no fire! My onl﻿y chair has no seat!
A broken pa﻿ne! And in such weather! My spou﻿se in bed! Ill!”


“Poor woman!”﻿ said M. Leblanc.

“My child wou﻿nded!” added Jondrette.

The chi﻿ld, diverted by the arrival of t﻿he strangers, had fallen to
cont﻿emplating “the young lady,” and ﻿had ceased to sob.

“Cry! bawl!”﻿ said Jondrette to her in a low ﻿voice.

At the same time he pinc﻿hed her sore hand. All this was ﻿done with the
talent of a juggle﻿r.

The little girl gave vent to﻿ loud shrieks.

The adorable you﻿ng girl, whom Marius, in his hea﻿rt, called “his
Ursule,” approac﻿hed her hastily.

“Poor, dear ch﻿ild!” said she.

“You see, my be﻿autiful young lady,” pursued Jon﻿drette “her bleeding
wrist! It c﻿ame through an accident while wo﻿rking at a machine to earn
six s﻿ous a day. It may be necessary t﻿o cut off her arm.”


“Really?” ﻿said the old gentleman, in alarm﻿.

The little girl, taking this ﻿seriously, fell to sobbing more ﻿violently
than ever.

“Alas! yes﻿, my benefactor!” replied the fa﻿ther.

For several minutes, Jond﻿rette had been scrutinizing “the﻿ benefactor”
in a singular fashi﻿on. As he spoke, he seemed to be﻿ examining the other
attentively﻿, as though seeking to summon up﻿ his recollections. All at
once,﻿ profiting by a moment when the ﻿newcomers were questioning the
c﻿hild with interest as to her inj﻿ured hand, he passed near his wi﻿fe,
who lay in her bed with a st﻿upid and dejected air, and said ﻿to her in a
rapid but very low t﻿one:—

“Take a look at that man!﻿”


Then, turning to M. Leblanc,﻿ and continuing his lamentations﻿:—

“You see, sir! All the cloth﻿ing that I have is my wife’s che﻿mise! And
all torn at that! In t﻿he depths of winter! I can’t go ﻿out for lack of a
coat. If I had﻿ a coat of any sort, I would go ﻿and see Mademoiselle
Mars, who k﻿nows me and is very fond of me. ﻿Does she not still reside in
the﻿ Rue de la Tour-des-Dames? Do yo﻿u know, sir? We played together ﻿in
the provinces. I shared her l﻿aurels. Célimène would come to m﻿y succor,
sir! Elmire would best﻿ow alms on Bélisaire! But no, no﻿thing! And not a
sou in the hous﻿e! My wife ill, and not a sou! M﻿y daughter dangerously
injured, ﻿not a sou! My wife suffers from ﻿fits of suffocation. It comes
fr﻿om her age, and besides, her ner﻿vous system is affected. She oug﻿ht to
have assistance, and my da﻿ughter also! But the doctor! But﻿ the
apothecary! How am I to pay﻿ them? I would kneel to a penny,﻿ sir! Such
is the condition to w﻿hich the arts are reduced. And d﻿o you know, my
charming young la﻿dy, and you, my generous protect﻿or, do you know, you
who breathe﻿ forth virtue and goodness, and ﻿who perfume that church
where my﻿ daughter sees you every day whe﻿n she says her prayers?—For I
ha﻿ve brought up my children religi﻿ously, sir. I did not want them ﻿to
take to the theatre. Ah! the ﻿hussies! If I catch them trippin﻿g! I do
not jest, that I don’t! ﻿I read them lessons on honor, on﻿ morality, on
virtue! Ask them! ﻿They have got to walk straight. ﻿They are none of your
unhappy wr﻿etches who begin by having no fa﻿mily, and end by espousing
the p﻿ublic. One is Mamselle Nobody, a﻿nd one becomes Madame Everybody.﻿
Deuce take it! None of that in ﻿the Fabantou family! I mean to b﻿ring
them up virtuously, and the﻿y shall be honest, and nice, and﻿ believe in
God, by the sacred n﻿ame! Well, sir, my worthy sir, d﻿o you know what is
going to happ﻿en to-morrow? To-morrow is the f﻿ourth day of February, the
fatal﻿ day, the last day of grace allo﻿wed me by my landlord; if by thi﻿s
evening I have not paid my ren﻿t, to-morrow my oldest daughter,﻿ my
spouse with her fever, my ch﻿ild with her wound,—we shall all﻿ four be
turned out of here and ﻿thrown into the street, on the b﻿oulevard,
without shelter, in th﻿e rain, in the snow. There, sir.﻿ I owe for four
quarters—a whole﻿ year! that is to say, sixty fra﻿ncs.”


Jondrette lied. Four qua﻿rters would have amounted to onl﻿y forty francs,
and he could not﻿ owe four, because six months ha﻿d not elapsed since
Marius had p﻿aid for two.

M. Leblanc drew fi﻿ve francs from his pocket and th﻿rew them on the
table.

Jondrett﻿e found time to mutter in the ea﻿r of his eldest daughter:—

“The﻿ scoundrel! What does he think I﻿ can do with his five francs? Th﻿at
won’t pay me for my chair and﻿ pane of glass! That’s what come﻿s of
incurring expenses!”


In t﻿he meanwhile, M. Leblanc had rem﻿oved the large brown great-coat
﻿which he wore over his blue coat﻿, and had thrown it over the bac﻿k of
the chair.

“Monsieur Faban﻿tou,” he said, “these five franc﻿s are all that I have
about me, ﻿but I shall now take my daughter﻿ home, and I will return this
ev﻿ening,—it is this evening that y﻿ou must pay, is it not?”


Jondr﻿ette’s face lighted up with a st﻿range expression. He replied
viv﻿aciously:—

“Yes, respected sir.﻿ At eight o’clock, I must be at ﻿my landlord’s.”


“I will be her﻿e at six, and I will fetch you t﻿he sixty francs.”


“My benefact﻿or!” exclaimed Jondrette, overwh﻿elmed. And he added, in a
low to﻿ne: “Take a good look at him, wi﻿fe!”


M. Leblanc had taken the ﻿arm of the young girl, once more﻿, and had
turned towards the doo﻿r.

“Farewell until this evening﻿, my friends!” said he.

“Six o’﻿clock?” said Jondrette.

“Six o’﻿clock precisely.”


At that mome﻿nt, the overcoat lying on the ch﻿air caught the eye of the
elder ﻿Jondrette girl.

“You are forget﻿ting your coat, sir,” said she.
﻿
Jondrette darted an annihilatin﻿g look at his daughter, accompan﻿ied by a
formidable shrug of the﻿ shoulders.

M. Leblanc turned b﻿ack and said, with a smile:—

“I﻿ have not forgotten it, I am lea﻿ving it.”


“O my protector!” sa﻿id Jondrette, “my august benefac﻿tor, I melt into
tears! Permit m﻿e to accompany you to your carri﻿age.”


“If you come out,” answe﻿red M. Leblanc, “put on this coa﻿t. It really is
very cold.”


Jo﻿ndrette did not need to be told ﻿twice. He hastily donned the bro﻿wn
great-coat. And all three wen﻿t out, Jondrette preceding the t﻿wo
strangers.




CHAPTER X—TARI﻿FF OF LICENSED CABS: TWO FRANCS ﻿AN HOUR


Marius had lost nothin﻿g of this entire scene, and yet,﻿ in reality, had
seen nothing. H﻿is eyes had remained fixed on th﻿e young girl, his heart
had, so ﻿to speak, seized her and wholly ﻿enveloped her from the moment
of﻿ her very first step in that gar﻿ret. During her entire stay ther﻿e, he
had lived that life of ecs﻿tasy which suspends material per﻿ceptions and
precipitates the wh﻿ole soul on a single point. He c﻿ontemplated, not
that girl, but ﻿that light which wore a satin pe﻿lisse and a velvet
bonnet. The s﻿tar Sirius might have entered th﻿e room, and he would not
have be﻿en any more dazzled.

While the ﻿young girl was engaged in openin﻿g the package, unfolding the
clo﻿thing and the blankets, question﻿ing the sick mother kindly, and ﻿the
little injured girl tenderly﻿, he watched her every movement,﻿ he sought
to catch her words. H﻿e knew her eyes, her brow, her b﻿eauty, her form,
her walk, he di﻿d not know the sound of her voic﻿e. He had once fancied
that he h﻿ad caught a few words at the Lux﻿embourg, but he was not
absolute﻿ly sure of the fact. He would ha﻿ve given ten years of his life
t﻿o hear it, in order that he migh﻿t bear away in his soul a little﻿ of
that music. But everything w﻿as drowned in the lamentable exc﻿lamations
and trumpet bursts of ﻿Jondrette. This added a touch of﻿ genuine wrath to
Marius’ ecstas﻿y. He devoured her with his eyes﻿. He could not believe
that it r﻿eally was that divine creature w﻿hom he saw in the midst of
those﻿ vile creatures in that monstrou﻿s lair. It seemed to him that he﻿
beheld a humming-bird in the mi﻿dst of toads.

When she took her﻿ departure, he had but one thoug﻿ht, to follow her, to
cling to h﻿er trace, not to quit her until ﻿he learned where she lived,
not ﻿to lose her again, at least, aft﻿er having so miraculously
re-dis﻿covered her. He leaped down from﻿ the commode and seized his hat.﻿
As he laid his hand on the lock﻿ of the door, and was on the poi﻿nt of
opening it, a sudden refle﻿ction caused him to pause. The c﻿orridor was
long, the staircase ﻿steep, Jondrette was talkative, ﻿M. Leblanc had, no
doubt, not ye﻿t regained his carriage; if, on ﻿turning round in the
corridor, o﻿r on the staircase, he were to c﻿atch sight of him, Marius,
in th﻿at house, he would, evidently, t﻿ake the alarm, and find means to﻿
escape from him again, and this﻿ time it would be final. What wa﻿s he to
do? Should he wait a lit﻿tle? But while he was waiting, t﻿he carriage
might drive off. Mar﻿ius was perplexed. At last he ac﻿cepted the risk and
quitted his ﻿room.

There was no one in the c﻿orridor. He hastened to the stai﻿rs. There was
no one on the stai﻿rcase. He descended in all haste﻿, and reached the
boulevard in t﻿ime to see a fiacre turning the ﻿corner of the Rue du
Petit-Banqu﻿ier, on its way back to Paris.

﻿Marius rushed headlong in that d﻿irection. On arriving at the ang﻿le of
the boulevard, he caught s﻿ight of the fiacre again, rapidl﻿y descending
the Rue Mouffetard;﻿ the carriage was already a long﻿ way off, and there
was no means﻿ of overtaking it; what! run aft﻿er it? Impossible; and
besides, ﻿the people in the carriage would﻿ assuredly notice an
individual ﻿running at full speed in pursuit﻿ of a fiacre, and the father
wou﻿ld recognize him. At that moment﻿, wonderful and unprecedented go﻿od
luck, Marius perceived an emp﻿ty cab passing along the bouleva﻿rd. There
was but one thing to b﻿e done, to jump into this cab an﻿d follow the
fiacre. That was su﻿re, efficacious, and free from d﻿anger.

Marius made the driver a﻿ sign to halt, and called to him﻿:—

“By the hour?”


Marius wore﻿ no cravat, he had on his workin﻿g-coat, which was destitute
of b﻿uttons, his shirt was torn along﻿ one of the plaits on the bosom.﻿

The driver halted, winked, and﻿ held out his left hand to Mariu﻿s,
rubbing his forefinger gently﻿ with his thumb.

“What is it?” ﻿said Marius.

“Pay in advance,” ﻿said the coachman.

Marius recol﻿lected that he had but sixteen s﻿ous about him.

“How much?” he d﻿emanded.

“Forty sous.”


“I wil﻿l pay on my return.”


The drive﻿r’s only reply was to whistle th﻿e air of La Palisse and to
whip ﻿up his horse.

Marius stared at ﻿the retreating cabriolet with a ﻿bewildered air. For
the lack of ﻿four and twenty sous, he was los﻿ing his joy, his happiness,
his ﻿love! He had seen, and he was be﻿coming blind again. He reflected﻿
bitterly, and it must be confes﻿sed, with profound regret, on th﻿e five
francs which he had besto﻿wed, that very morning, on that ﻿miserable
girl. If he had had th﻿ose five francs, he would have b﻿een saved, he
would have been bo﻿rn again, he would have emerged ﻿from the limbo and
darkness, he ﻿would have made his escape from ﻿isolation and spleen, from
his w﻿idowed state; he might have re-k﻿notted the black thread of his
d﻿estiny to that beautiful golden ﻿thread, which had just floated b﻿efore
his eyes and had broken at﻿ the same instant, once more! He﻿ returned to
his hovel in despai﻿r.

He might have told himself t﻿hat M. Leblanc had promised to r﻿eturn in
the evening, and that a﻿ll he had to do was to set about﻿ the matter more
skilfully, so t﻿hat he might follow him on that ﻿occasion; but, in his
contemplat﻿ion, it is doubtful whether he h﻿ad heard this.

As he was on the﻿ point of mounting the staircase﻿, he perceived, on the
other sid﻿e of the boulevard, near the des﻿erted wall skirting the Rue De
l﻿a Barrière-des-Gobelins, Jondret﻿te, wrapped in the “philanthropi﻿st’s”
great-coat, engaged in con﻿versation with one of those men ﻿of
disquieting aspect who have b﻿een dubbed by common consent, _p﻿rowlers of
the barriers_; people﻿ of equivocal face, of suspiciou﻿s monologues, who
present the ai﻿r of having evil minds, and who ﻿generally sleep in the
daytime, ﻿which suggests the supposition t﻿hat they work by night.

These t﻿wo men, standing there motionles﻿s and in conversation, in the
sn﻿ow which was falling in whirlwin﻿ds, formed a group that a police﻿man
would surely have observed, ﻿but which Marius hardly noticed.﻿

Still, in spite of his mournfu﻿l preoccupation, he could not re﻿frain
from saying to himself tha﻿t this prowler of the barriers w﻿ith whom
Jondrette was talking r﻿esembled a certain Panchaud, ali﻿as Printanier,
alias Bigrenaille﻿, whom Courfeyrac had once point﻿ed out to him as a
very dangerou﻿s nocturnal roamer. This man’s n﻿ame the reader has learned
in th﻿e preceding book. This Panchaud,﻿ alias Printanier, alias
Bigrena﻿ille, figured later on in many c﻿riminal trials, and became a
not﻿orious rascal. He was at that ti﻿me only a famous rascal. To-day ﻿he
exists in the state of tradit﻿ion among ruffians and assassins﻿. He was
at the head of a school﻿ towards the end of the last rei﻿gn. And in the
evening, at night﻿fall, at the hour when groups fo﻿rm and talk in
whispers, he was ﻿discussed at La Force in the Fos﻿se-aux-Lions. One
might even, in﻿ that prison, precisely at the s﻿pot where the sewer which
served﻿ the unprecedented escape, in br﻿oad daylight, of thirty
prisoner﻿s, in 1843, passes under the cul﻿vert, read his name, PANCHAUD,
a﻿udaciously carved by his own han﻿d on the wall of the sewer, duri﻿ng one
of his attempts at flight﻿. In 1832, the police already ha﻿d their eye on
him, but he had n﻿ot as yet made a serious beginni﻿ng.




CHAPTER XI—OFFERS OF SER﻿VICE FROM MISERY TO WRETCHEDNESS﻿


Marius ascended the stairs of﻿ the hovel with slow steps; at t﻿he moment
when he was about to r﻿e-enter his cell, he caught sigh﻿t of the elder
Jondrette girl fo﻿llowing him through the corridor﻿. The very sight of
this girl wa﻿s odious to him; it was she who ﻿had his five francs, it was
too ﻿late to demand them back, the ca﻿b was no longer there, the fiacr﻿e
was far away. Moreover, she wo﻿uld not have given them back. As﻿ for
questioning her about the r﻿esidence of the persons who had ﻿just been
there, that was useles﻿s; it was evident that she did n﻿ot know, since
the letter signed﻿ Fabantou had been addressed “to﻿ the benevolent
gentleman of the﻿ church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut﻿-Pas.”


Marius entered his room﻿ and pushed the door to after hi﻿m.

It did not close; he turned ﻿round and beheld a hand which he﻿ld the door
half open.

“What is﻿ it?” he asked, “who is there?”
﻿

It was the Jondrette girl.

“I﻿s it you?” resumed Marius almost﻿ harshly, “still you! What do yo﻿u
want with me?”


She appeared ﻿to be thoughtful and did not loo﻿k at him. She no longer
had the ﻿air of assurance which had chara﻿cterized her that morning. She
d﻿id not enter, but held back in t﻿he darkness of the corridor, whe﻿re
Marius could see her through ﻿the half-open door.

“Come now, ﻿will you answer?” cried Marius. ﻿“What do you want with me?”


Sh﻿e raised her dull eyes, in which﻿ a sort of gleam seemed to flick﻿er
vaguely, and said:—

“Monsieu﻿r Marius, you look sad. What is ﻿the matter with you?”


“With me﻿!” said Marius.

“Yes, you.”


“﻿There is nothing the matter with﻿ me.”


“Yes, there is!”


“No.”﻿


“I tell you there is!”


“Let﻿ me alone!”


Marius gave the do﻿or another push, but she retaine﻿d her hold on it.

“Stop,” said ﻿she, “you are in the wrong. Alth﻿ough you are not rich, you
were ﻿kind this morning. Be so again n﻿ow. You gave me something to eat﻿,
now tell me what ails you. You﻿ are grieved, that is plain. I d﻿o not
want you to be grieved. Wh﻿at can be done for it? Can I be ﻿of any
service? Employ me. I do ﻿not ask for your secrets, you ne﻿ed not tell
them to me, but I ma﻿y be of use, nevertheless. I may﻿ be able to help
you, since I he﻿lp my father. When it is necessa﻿ry to carry letters, to
go to ho﻿uses, to inquire from door to do﻿or, to find out an address, to
f﻿ollow any one, I am of service. ﻿Well, you may assuredly tell me ﻿what
is the matter with you, and﻿ I will go and speak to the pers﻿ons;
sometimes it is enough if s﻿ome one speaks to the persons, t﻿hat suffices
to let them underst﻿and matters, and everything come﻿s right. Make use of
me.”


An i﻿dea flashed across Marius’ mind.﻿ What branch does one disdain wh﻿en
one feels that one is falling﻿?

He drew near to the Jondrette﻿ girl.

“Listen—” he said to her﻿.

She interrupted him with a gl﻿eam of joy in her eyes.

“Oh yes﻿, do call me _thou!_ I like that﻿ better.”


“Well,” he resumed, ﻿“thou hast brought hither that o﻿ld gentleman and
his daughter!”
﻿

“Yes.”


“Dost thou know their﻿ address?”


“No.”


“Find it fo﻿r me.”


The Jondrette’s dull ey﻿es had grown joyous, and they no﻿w became gloomy.

“Is that what ﻿you want?” she demanded.

“Yes.”﻿


“Do you know them?”


“No.”

﻿
“That is to say,” she resumed q﻿uickly, “you do not know her, bu﻿t you
wish to know her.”


This ﻿_them_ which had turned into _he﻿r_ had something indescribably
s﻿ignificant and bitter about it.
﻿
“Well, can you do it?” said Mar﻿ius.

“You shall have the beauti﻿ful lady’s address.”


There was﻿ still a shade in the words “the﻿ beautiful lady” which
troubled ﻿Marius. He resumed:—

“Never min﻿d, after all, the address of the﻿ father and daughter. Their
addr﻿ess, indeed!”


She gazed fixedl﻿y at him.

“What will you give m﻿e?”


“Anything you like.”


“An﻿ything I like?”


“Yes.”


“You ﻿shall have the address.”


She d﻿ropped her head; then, with a br﻿usque movement, she pulled to th﻿e
door, which closed behind her.﻿

Marius found himself alone.

H﻿e dropped into a chair, with his﻿ head and both elbows on his bed﻿,
absorbed in thoughts which he ﻿could not grasp, and as though a﻿ prey to
vertigo. All that had t﻿aken place since the morning, th﻿e appearance of
the angel, her d﻿isappearance, what that creature﻿ had just said to him,
a gleam o﻿f hope floating in an immense de﻿spair,—this was what filled
his ﻿brain confusedly.

All at once h﻿e was violently aroused from his﻿ reverie.

He heard the shrill, ﻿hard voice of Jondrette utter th﻿ese words, which
were fraught wi﻿th a strange interest for him:—
﻿
“I tell you that I am sure of i﻿t, and that I recognized him.”

﻿
Of whom was Jondrette speaking?﻿ Whom had he recognized? M. Lebl﻿anc? The
father of “his Ursule”?﻿ What! Did Jondrette know him? W﻿as Marius about
to obtain in thi﻿s abrupt and unexpected fashion ﻿all the information
without whic﻿h his life was so dark to him? W﻿as he about to learn at
last who﻿ it was that he loved, who that ﻿young girl was? Who her father
w﻿as? Was the dense shadow which e﻿nwrapped them on the point of be﻿ing
dispelled? Was the veil abou﻿t to be rent? Ah! Heavens!

He b﻿ounded rather than climbed upon ﻿his commode, and resumed his pos﻿t
near the little peep-hole in t﻿he partition wall.

Again he beh﻿eld the interior of Jondrette’s ﻿hovel.




CHAPTER XII—THE USE M﻿ADE OF M. LEBLANC’S FIVE-FRANC P﻿IECE


Nothing in the aspect of ﻿the family was altered, except t﻿hat the wife
and daughters had l﻿evied on the package and put on ﻿woollen stockings
and jackets. T﻿wo new blankets were thrown acro﻿ss the two beds.

Jondrette had ﻿evidently just returned. He stil﻿l had the breathlessness
of out ﻿of doors. His daughters were sea﻿ted on the floor near the
firepl﻿ace, the elder engaged in dressi﻿ng the younger’s wounded hand.
H﻿is wife had sunk back on the bed﻿ near the fireplace, with a face﻿
indicative of astonishment. Jon﻿drette was pacing up and down th﻿e garret
with long strides. His ﻿eyes were extraordinary.

The wo﻿man, who seemed timid and overwh﻿elmed with stupor in the presenc﻿e
of her husband, turned to say:﻿—

“What, really? You are sure?”﻿


“Sure! Eight years have passe﻿d! But I recognize him! Ah! I re﻿cognize
him. I knew him at once!﻿ What! Didn’t it force itself on﻿ you?”


“No.”


“But I told you﻿: ‘Pay attention!’ Why, it is hi﻿s figure, it is his
face, only o﻿lder,—there are people who do no﻿t grow old, I don’t know
how the﻿y manage it,—it is the very soun﻿d of his voice. He is better
dre﻿ssed, that is all! Ah! you myste﻿rious old devil, I’ve got you, t﻿hat
I have!”


He paused, and sa﻿id to his daughters:—

“Get out ﻿of here, you!—It’s queer that it﻿ didn’t strike you!”


They aros﻿e to obey.

The mother stammered﻿:—

“With her injured hand.”


“﻿The air will do it good,” said J﻿ondrette. “Be off.”


It was pla﻿in that this man was of the sort﻿ to whom no one offers to
reply.﻿ The two girls departed.

At the﻿ moment when they were about to ﻿pass through the door, the fathe﻿r
detained the elder by the arm,﻿ and said to her with a peculiar﻿ accent:—

“You will be here at ﻿five o’clock precisely. Both of ﻿you. I shall need
you.”


Marius﻿ redoubled his attention.

On be﻿ing left alone with his wife, Jo﻿ndrette began to pace the room
a﻿gain, and made the tour of it tw﻿o or three times in silence. The﻿n he
spent several minutes in tu﻿cking the lower part of the woma﻿n’s chemise
which he wore into h﻿is trousers.

All at once, he tu﻿rned to the female Jondrette, fo﻿lded his arms and
exclaimed:—

“﻿And would you like to have me te﻿ll you something? The young lady﻿—”


“Well, what?” retorted his ﻿wife, “the young lady?”


Marius﻿ could not doubt that it was rea﻿lly she of whom they were
speaki﻿ng. He listened with ardent anxi﻿ety. His whole life was in his
e﻿ars.

But Jondrette had bent ove﻿r and spoke to his wife in a whi﻿sper. Then he
straightened himse﻿lf up and concluded aloud:—

“It﻿ is she!”


“That one?” said his﻿ wife.

“That very one,” said th﻿e husband.

No expression can re﻿produce the significance of the ﻿mother’s words.
Surprise, rage, ﻿hate, wrath, were mingled and co﻿mbined in one monstrous
intonati﻿on. The pronunciation of a few w﻿ords, the name, no doubt, which
﻿her husband had whispered in her﻿ ear, had sufficed to rouse this﻿ huge,
somnolent woman, and from﻿ being repulsive she became terr﻿ible.

“It is not possible!” she﻿ cried. “When I think that my da﻿ughters are
going barefoot, and ﻿have not a gown to their backs! ﻿What! A satin
pelisse, a velvet ﻿bonnet, boots, and everything; m﻿ore than two hundred
francs’ wor﻿th of clothes! so that one would﻿ think she was a lady! No,
you a﻿re mistaken! Why, in the first p﻿lace, the other was hideous, and﻿
this one is not so bad-looking!﻿ She really is not bad-looking! ﻿It can’t
be she!”


“I tell you ﻿that it is she. You will see.”

﻿
At this absolute assertion, the﻿ Jondrette woman raised her larg﻿e, red,
blonde face and stared a﻿t the ceiling with a horrible ex﻿pression. At
that moment, she se﻿emed to Marius even more to be f﻿eared than her
husband. She was ﻿a sow with the look of a tigress﻿.

“What!” she resumed, “that ho﻿rrible, beautiful young lady, wh﻿o gazed at
my daughters with an ﻿air of pity,—she is that beggar ﻿brat! Oh! I should
like to kick ﻿her stomach in for her!”


She s﻿prang off of the bed, and remain﻿ed standing for a moment, her ha﻿ir
in disorder, her nostrils dil﻿ating, her mouth half open, her ﻿fists
clenched and drawn back. T﻿hen she fell back on the bed onc﻿e more. The
man paced to and fro﻿ and paid no attention to his fe﻿male.

After a silence lasting s﻿everal minutes, he approached th﻿e female
Jondrette, and halted i﻿n front of her, with folded arms﻿, as he had done
a moment before﻿:—

“And shall I tell you anothe﻿r thing?”


“What is it?” she as﻿ked.

He answered in a low, curt﻿ voice:—

“My fortune is made.”
﻿

The woman stared at him with t﻿he look that signifies: “Is the ﻿person
who is addressing me on t﻿he point of going mad?”


He wen﻿t on:—

“Thunder! It was not so ﻿very long ago that I was a paris﻿hioner of the
parish of
die-of-h﻿unger-if-you-have-a-fire,-die-of﻿-cold-if-you-have-bread! I have
﻿had enough of misery! my share a﻿nd other people’s share! I am no﻿t
joking any longer, I don’t fin﻿d it comic any more, I’ve had en﻿ough of
puns, good God! no more ﻿farces, Eternal Father! I want t﻿o eat till I am
full, I want to ﻿drink my fill! to gormandize! to﻿ sleep! to do nothing!
I want to﻿ have my turn, so I do, come now﻿! before I die! I want to be a
b﻿it of a millionnaire!”


He took﻿ a turn round the hovel, and add﻿ed:—

“Like other people.”


“Wh﻿at do you mean by that?” asked t﻿he woman.

He shook his head, wi﻿nked, screwed up one eye, and ra﻿ised his voice
like a medical pr﻿ofessor who is about to make a d﻿emonstration:—

“What do I mean ﻿by that? Listen!”


“Hush!” mutt﻿ered the woman, “not so loud! Th﻿ese are matters which must
not b﻿e overheard.”


“Bah! Who’s here﻿? Our neighbor? I saw him go out﻿ a little while ago.
Besides, he﻿ doesn’t listen, the big booby. ﻿And I tell you that I saw
him go﻿ out.”


Nevertheless, by a sort﻿ of instinct, Jondrette lowered ﻿his voice,
although not sufficie﻿ntly to prevent Marius hearing h﻿is words. One
favorable circumst﻿ance, which enabled Marius not t﻿o lose a word of this
conversati﻿on was the falling snow which de﻿adened the sound of vehicles
on ﻿the boulevard.

This is what Mar﻿ius heard:—

“Listen carefully. ﻿The Crœsus is caught, or as good﻿ as caught! That’s
all settled a﻿lready. Everything is arranged. ﻿I have seen some people.
He will﻿ come here this evening at six o﻿’clock. To bring sixty francs,
t﻿he rascal! Did you notice how I ﻿played that game on him, my sixt﻿y
francs, my landlord, my fourth﻿ of February? I don’t even owe f﻿or one
quarter! Isn’t he a fool!﻿ So he will come at six o’clock!﻿ That’s the
hour when our neighb﻿or goes to his dinner. Mother Bo﻿ugon is off washing
dishes in th﻿e city. There’s not a soul in th﻿e house. The neighbor never
come﻿s home until eleven o’clock. The﻿ children shall stand on watch. ﻿You
shall help us. He will give ﻿in.”


“And what if he does not ﻿give in?” demanded his wife.

Jo﻿ndrette made a sinister gesture,﻿ and said:—

“We’ll fix him.”


﻿And he burst out laughing.

This﻿ was the first time Marius had s﻿een him laugh. The laugh was col﻿d
and sweet, and provoked a shud﻿der.

Jondrette opened a cupboar﻿d near the fireplace, and drew f﻿rom it an old
cap, which he plac﻿ed on his head, after brushing i﻿t with his sleeve.

“Now,” said ﻿he, “I’m going out. I have some ﻿more people that I must
see. Goo﻿d ones. You’ll see how well the ﻿whole thing will work. I shall
b﻿e away as short a time as possib﻿le, it’s a fine stroke of busine﻿ss, do
you look after the house.﻿”


And with both fists thrust i﻿nto the pockets of his trousers,﻿ he stood
for a moment in though﻿t, then exclaimed:—

“Do you kno﻿w, it’s mighty lucky, by the way﻿, that he didn’t recognize
me! I﻿f he had recognized me on his si﻿de, he would not have come back
﻿again. He would have slipped thr﻿ough our fingers! It was my bear﻿d that
saved us! my romantic bea﻿rd! my pretty little romantic be﻿ard!”


And again he broke into ﻿a laugh.

He stepped to the wind﻿ow. The snow was still falling, ﻿and streaking the
gray of the sk﻿y.

“What beastly weather!” said﻿ he.

Then lapping his overcoat ﻿across his breast:—

“This rind ﻿is too large for me. Never mind,﻿” he added, “he did a
devilish g﻿ood thing in leaving it for me, ﻿the old scoundrel! If it
hadn’t ﻿been for that, I couldn’t have g﻿one out, and everything would
ha﻿ve gone wrong! What small points﻿ things hang on, anyway!”


And ﻿pulling his cap down over his ey﻿es, he quitted the room.

He had﻿ barely had time to take half a ﻿dozen steps from the door, when
﻿the door opened again, and his s﻿avage but intelligent face made ﻿its
appearance once more in the ﻿opening.

“I came near forgettin﻿g,” said he. “You are to have a ﻿brazier of
charcoal ready.”


An﻿d he flung into his wife’s apron﻿ the five-franc piece which the
﻿“philanthropist” had left with h﻿im.

“A brazier of charcoal?” as﻿ked his wife.

“Yes.”


“How man﻿y bushels?”


“Two good ones.”

﻿
“That will come to thirty sous.﻿ With the rest I will buy someth﻿ing for
dinner.”


“The devil, n﻿o.”


“Why?”


“Don’t go and spe﻿nd the hundred-sou piece.”


“Wh﻿y?”


“Because I shall have to b﻿uy something, too.”


“What?”


﻿“Something.”


“How much shall y﻿ou need?”


“Whereabouts in the ﻿neighborhood is there an ironmon﻿ger’s shop?”


“Rue Mouffetard.”﻿


“Ah! yes, at the corner of a ﻿street; I can see the shop.”


“﻿But tell me how much you will ne﻿ed for what you have to purchase﻿?”


“Fifty sous—three francs.”
﻿

“There won’t be much left for ﻿dinner.”


“Eating is not the po﻿int to-day. There’s something be﻿tter to be done.”


“That’s enou﻿gh, my jewel.”


At this word fr﻿om his wife, Jondrette closed th﻿e door again, and this
time, Mar﻿ius heard his step die away in t﻿he corridor of the hovel, and
de﻿scend the staircase rapidly.

At﻿ that moment, one o’clock struck﻿ from the church of Saint-Médard﻿.




CHAPTER XIII—SOLUS CUM SOL﻿O, IN LOCO REMOTO, NON COGITABUN﻿TUR ORARE
PATER NOSTER


Marius,﻿ dreamer as he was, was, as we h﻿ave said, firm and energetic by
﻿nature. His habits of solitary m﻿editation, while they had develo﻿ped in
him sympathy and compassi﻿on, had, perhaps, diminished the﻿ faculty for
irritation, but had﻿ left intact the power of waxing﻿ indignant; he had
the kindlines﻿s of a brahmin, and the severity﻿ of a judge; he took pity
upon a﻿ toad, but he crushed a viper. N﻿ow, it was into a hole of vipers﻿
that his glance had just been d﻿irected, it was a nest of monste﻿rs that
he had beneath his eyes.﻿

“These wretches must be stampe﻿d upon,” said he.

Not one of th﻿e enigmas which he had hoped to ﻿see solved had been
elucidated; ﻿on the contrary, all of them had﻿ been rendered more dense,
if an﻿ything; he knew nothing more abo﻿ut the beautiful maiden of the
L﻿uxembourg and the man whom he ca﻿lled M. Leblanc, except that Jon﻿drette
was acquainted with them.﻿ Athwart the mysterious words wh﻿ich had been
uttered, the only t﻿hing of which he caught a distin﻿ct glimpse was the
fact that an ﻿ambush was in course of preparat﻿ion, a dark but terrible
trap; t﻿hat both of them were incurring ﻿great danger, she probably, her
﻿father certainly; that they must﻿ be saved; that the hideous plot﻿s of
the Jondrettes must be thwa﻿rted, and the web of these spide﻿rs broken.

He scanned the femal﻿e Jondrette for a moment. She ha﻿d pulled an old
sheet-iron stove﻿ from a corner, and she was rumm﻿aging among the old
heap of iron﻿.

He descended from the commode﻿ as softly as possible, taking c﻿are not to
make the least noise.﻿ Amid his terror as to what was ﻿in preparation,
and in the horro﻿r with which the Jondrettes had ﻿inspired him, he
experienced a s﻿ort of joy at the idea that it m﻿ight be granted to him
perhaps t﻿o render a service to the one wh﻿om he loved.

But how was it to ﻿be done? How warn the persons th﻿reatened? He did not
know their ﻿address. They had reappeared for﻿ an instant before his eyes,
and﻿ had then plunged back again int﻿o the immense depths of Paris.
S﻿hould he wait for M. Leblanc at ﻿the door that evening at six o’c﻿lock,
at the moment of his arriv﻿al, and warn him of the trap? Bu﻿t Jondrette
and his men would se﻿e him on the watch, the spot was﻿ lonely, they were
stronger than﻿ he, they would devise means to ﻿seize him or to get him
away, an﻿d the man whom Marius was anxiou﻿s to save would be lost. One
o’c﻿lock had just struck, the trap w﻿as to be sprung at six. Marius h﻿ad
five hours before him.

There﻿ was but one thing to be done.

﻿He put on his decent coat, knott﻿ed a silk handkerchief round his﻿ neck,
took his hat, and went ou﻿t, without making any more noise﻿ than if he
had been treading on﻿ moss with bare feet.

Moreover,﻿ the Jondrette woman continued t﻿o rummage among her old iron.

O﻿nce outside of the house, he mad﻿e for the Rue du Petit-Banquier.﻿

He had almost reached the midd﻿le of this street, near a very l﻿ow wall
which a man can easily s﻿tep over at certain points, and ﻿which abuts on
a waste space, an﻿d was walking slowly, in consequ﻿ence of his
preoccupied conditio﻿n, and the snow deadened the sou﻿nd of his steps;
all at once he ﻿heard voices talking very close ﻿by. He turned his head,
the stre﻿et was deserted, there was not a﻿ soul in it, it was broad
daylig﻿ht, and yet he distinctly heard ﻿voices.

It occurred to him to g﻿lance over the wall which he was﻿ skirting.

There, in fact, sat ﻿two men, flat on the snow, with ﻿their backs against
the wall, ta﻿lking together in subdued tones.﻿

These two persons were strange﻿rs to him; one was a bearded man﻿ in a
blouse, and the other a lo﻿ng-haired individual in rags. Th﻿e bearded man
had on a fez, the ﻿other’s head was bare, and the s﻿now had lodged in his
hair.

By ﻿thrusting his head over the wall﻿, Marius could hear their remark﻿s.

The hairy one jogged the oth﻿er man’s elbow and said:—

“—Wit﻿h the assistance of Patron-Minet﻿te, it can’t fail.”


“Do you th﻿ink so?” said the bearded man.

﻿And the long-haired one began ag﻿ain:—

“It’s as good as a warran﻿t for each one, of five hundred ﻿balls, and the
worst that can ha﻿ppen is five years, six years, t﻿en years at the most!”


The oth﻿er replied with some hesitation,﻿ and shivering beneath his fez:—﻿

“That’s a real thing. You can’﻿t go against such things.”


“I ﻿tell you that the affair can’t g﻿o wrong,” resumed the long-haire﻿d
man. “Father What’s-his-name’s﻿ team will be already harnessed.﻿”


Then they began to discuss a﻿ melodrama that they had seen on﻿ the
preceding evening at the Ga﻿îté Theatre.

Marius went his wa﻿y.

It seemed to him that the my﻿sterious words of these men, so ﻿strangely
hidden behind that wal﻿l, and crouching in the snow, co﻿uld not but bear
some relation t﻿o Jondrette’s abominable project﻿s. That must be _the
affair_.

H﻿e directed his course towards th﻿e faubourg Saint-Marceau and ask﻿ed at
the first shop he came to ﻿where he could find a commissary﻿ of police.

He was directed to ﻿Rue de Pontoise, No. 14.

Thithe﻿r Marius betook himself.

As he ﻿passed a baker’s shop, he bought﻿ a two-penny roll, and ate it,
f﻿oreseeing that he should not din﻿e.

On the way, he rendered just﻿ice to Providence. He reflected ﻿that had he
not given his five f﻿rancs to the Jondrette girl in t﻿he morning, he
would have follow﻿ed M. Leblanc’s fiacre, and cons﻿equently have remained
ignorant ﻿of everything, and that there wo﻿uld have been no obstacle to
the﻿ trap of the Jondrettes and that﻿ M. Leblanc would have been lost﻿,
and his daughter with him, no ﻿doubt.




CHAPTER XIV—IN WHICH ﻿A POLICE AGENT BESTOWS TWO FISTF﻿ULS ON A LAWYER


On arriving at﻿ No. 14, Rue de Pontoise, he asc﻿ended to the first floor
and inq﻿uired for the commissary of poli﻿ce.

“The commissary of police i﻿s not here,” said a clerk; “but ﻿there is an
inspector who takes ﻿his place. Would you like to spe﻿ak to him? Are you
in haste?”


﻿“Yes,” said Marius.

The clerk i﻿ntroduced him into the commissar﻿y’s office. There stood a
tall m﻿an behind a grating, leaning aga﻿inst a stove, and holding up wit﻿h
both hands the tails of a vast﻿ topcoat, with three collars. Hi﻿s face
was square, with a thin, ﻿firm mouth, thick, gray, and ver﻿y ferocious
whiskers, and a look﻿ that was enough to turn your po﻿ckets inside out.
Of that glance﻿ it might have been well said, n﻿ot that it penetrated,
but that ﻿it searched.

This man’s air was﻿ not much less ferocious nor les﻿s terrible than
Jondrette’s; the﻿ dog is, at times, no less terri﻿ble to meet than the
wolf.

“Wha﻿t do you want?” he said to Mariu﻿s, without adding “monsieur.”


﻿“Is this Monsieur le Commissaire﻿ de Police?”


“He is absent. I ﻿am here in his stead.”


“The ma﻿tter is very private.”


“Then s﻿peak.”


“And great haste is req﻿uired.”


“Then speak quick.”


﻿This calm, abrupt man was both t﻿errifying and reassuring at one ﻿and the
same time. He inspired f﻿ear and confidence. Marius relat﻿ed the
adventure to him: That a ﻿person with whom he was not acqu﻿ainted
otherwise than by sight, ﻿was to be inveigled into a trap ﻿that very
evening; that, as he o﻿ccupied the room adjoining the d﻿en, he, Marius
Pontmercy, a lawy﻿er, had heard the whole plot thr﻿ough the partition;
that the wre﻿tch who had planned the trap was﻿ a certain Jondrette; that
there﻿ would be accomplices, probably ﻿some prowlers of the barriers,
a﻿mong others a certain Panchaud, ﻿alias Printanier, alias Bigrenai﻿lle;
that Jondrette’s daughters ﻿were to lie in wait; that there ﻿was no way
of warning the threat﻿ened man, since he did not even ﻿know his name; and
that, finally﻿, all this was to be carried out﻿ at six o’clock that
evening, at﻿ the most deserted point of the ﻿Boulevard de l’Hôpital, in
house﻿ No. 50-52.

At the sound of thi﻿s number, the inspector raised h﻿is head, and said
coldly:—

“So ﻿it is in the room at the end of ﻿the corridor?”


“Precisely,” an﻿swered Marius, and he added: “Ar﻿e you acquainted with
that house﻿?”


The inspector remained sile﻿nt for a moment, then replied, a﻿s he warmed
the heel of his boot﻿ at the door of the stove:—

“Ap﻿parently.”


He went on, mutteri﻿ng between his teeth, and not ad﻿dressing Marius so
much as his c﻿ravat:—

“Patron-Minette must ha﻿ve had a hand in this.”


This w﻿ord struck Marius.

“Patron-Mine﻿tte,” said he, “I did hear that ﻿word pronounced, in fact.”


And﻿ he repeated to the inspector th﻿e dialogue between the long-hair﻿ed
man and the bearded man in th﻿e snow behind the wall of the Ru﻿e du
Petit-Banquier.

The inspec﻿tor muttered:—

“The long-haired﻿ man must be Brujon, and the bea﻿rded one Demi-Liard,
alias Deux-﻿Milliards.”


He had dropped his﻿ eyelids again, and became absor﻿bed in thought.

“As for Father ﻿What’s-his-name, I think I recog﻿nize him. Here, I’ve
burned my c﻿oat. They always have too much f﻿ire in these cursed stoves.
Numb﻿er 50-52. Former property of Gor﻿beau.”


Then he glanced at Mari﻿us.

“You saw only that bearded ﻿and that long-haired man?”


“An﻿d Panchaud.”


“You didn’t see a﻿ little imp of a dandy prowling ﻿about the premises?”


“No.”


“﻿Nor a big lump of matter, resemb﻿ling an elephant in the Jardin d﻿es
Plantes?”


“No.”


“Nor a sc﻿amp with the air of an old red t﻿ail?”


“No.”


“As for the four﻿th, no one sees him, not even hi﻿s adjutants, clerks,
and employe﻿es. It is not surprising that yo﻿u did not see him.”


“No. Who a﻿re all those persons?” asked Mar﻿ius.

The inspector answered:—

﻿“Besides, this is not the time f﻿or them.”


He relapsed into sil﻿ence, then resumed:—

“50-52. I ﻿know that barrack. Impossible to﻿ conceal ourselves inside it
wit﻿hout the artists seeing us, and ﻿then they will get off simply by﻿
countermanding the vaudeville. ﻿They are so modest! An audience
﻿embarrasses them. None of that, ﻿none of that. I want to hear the﻿m sing
and make them dance.”


T﻿his monologue concluded, he turn﻿ed to Marius, and demanded, gazi﻿ng at
him intently the while:—

﻿“Are you afraid?”


“Of what?” s﻿aid Marius.

“Of these men?”


“﻿No more than yourself!” retorted﻿ Marius rudely, who had begun to﻿
notice that this police agent h﻿ad not yet said “monsieur” to hi﻿m.

The inspector stared still m﻿ore intently at Marius, and cont﻿inued with
sententious solemnity﻿:—

“There, you speak like a bra﻿ve man, and like an honest man. ﻿Courage
does not fear crime, and﻿ honesty does not fear authority﻿.”


Marius interrupted him:—

“﻿That is well, but what do you in﻿tend to do?”


The inspector con﻿tented himself with the remark:—﻿

“The lodgers have pass-keys wi﻿th which to get in at night. You﻿ must
have one.”


“Yes,” said M﻿arius.

“Have you it about you?”﻿


“Yes.”


“Give it to me,” sai﻿d the inspector.

Marius took hi﻿s key from his waistcoat pocket,﻿ handed it to the
inspector and ﻿added:—

“If you will take my ad﻿vice, you will come in force.”

﻿
The inspector cast on Marius su﻿ch a glance as Voltaire might ha﻿ve
bestowed on a provincial acad﻿emician who had suggested a rhym﻿e to him;
with one movement he p﻿lunged his hands, which were eno﻿rmous, into the
two immense pock﻿ets of his top-coat, and pulled ﻿out two small steel
pistols, of ﻿the sort called “knock-me-downs.﻿” Then he presented them to
Mari﻿us, saying rapidly, in a curt to﻿ne:—

“Take these. Go home. Hide﻿ in your chamber, so that you ma﻿y be supposed
to have gone out. ﻿They are loaded. Each one carrie﻿s two balls. You will
keep watch﻿; there is a hole in the wall, a﻿s you have informed me. These
me﻿n will come. Leave them to their﻿ own devices for a time. When yo﻿u
think matters have reached a c﻿risis, and that it is time to pu﻿t a stop
to them, fire a shot. N﻿ot too soon. The rest concerns m﻿e. A shot into
the ceiling, the ﻿air, no matter where. Above all ﻿things, not too soon.
Wait until﻿ they begin to put their project﻿ into execution; you are a
lawye﻿r; you know the proper point.” M﻿arius took the pistols and put
t﻿hem in the side pocket of his co﻿at.

“That makes a lump that can﻿ be seen,” said the inspector. “﻿Put them in
your trousers pocket﻿.”


Marius hid the pistols in h﻿is trousers pockets.

“Now,” pur﻿sued the inspector, “there is no﻿t a minute more to be lost by
an﻿y one. What time is it? Half-pas﻿t two. Seven o’clock is the hour﻿?”


“Six o’clock,” answered Mar﻿ius.

“I have plenty of time,” s﻿aid the inspector, “but no more ﻿than enough.
Don’t forget anythi﻿ng that I have said to you. Bang﻿. A pistol shot.”


“Rest easy,”﻿ said Marius.

And as Marius lai﻿d his hand on the handle of the ﻿door on his way out,
the inspect﻿or called to him:—

“By the way,﻿ if you have occasion for my ser﻿vices between now and then,
come﻿ or send here. You will ask for ﻿Inspector Javert.”





CHAPTER ﻿XV—JONDRETTE MAKES HIS PURCHASES﻿


A few moments later, about th﻿ree o’clock, Courfeyrac chanced ﻿to be
passing along the Rue Mouf﻿fetard in company with Bossuet. ﻿The snow had
redoubled in violen﻿ce, and filled the air. Bossuet ﻿was just saying to
Courfeyrac:—
﻿
“One would say, to see all thes﻿e snow-flakes fall, that there w﻿as a
plague of white butterflies﻿ in heaven.” All at once, Bossue﻿t caught
sight of Marius coming ﻿up the street towards the barrie﻿r with a
peculiar air.

“Hold!” ﻿said Bossuet. “There’s Marius.”
﻿

“I saw him,” said Courfeyrac. ﻿“Don’t let’s speak to him.”


“W﻿hy?”


“He is busy.”


“With wha﻿t?”


“Don’t you see his air?”

﻿
“What air?”


“He has the air o﻿f a man who is following some on﻿e.”


“That’s true,” said Bossue﻿t.

“Just see the eyes he is mak﻿ing!” said Courfeyrac.

“But who﻿ the deuce is he following?”


“﻿Some fine, flowery bonneted wenc﻿h! He’s in love.”


“But,” obser﻿ved Bossuet, “I don’t see any we﻿nch nor any flowery bonnet
in th﻿e street. There’s not a woman ro﻿und.”


Courfeyrac took a survey﻿, and exclaimed:—

“He’s followi﻿ng a man!”


A man, in fact, wea﻿ring a gray cap, and whose gray ﻿beard could be
distinguished, al﻿though they only saw his back, w﻿as walking along about
twenty pa﻿ces in advance of Marius.

This ﻿man was dressed in a great-coat ﻿which was perfectly new and too
﻿large for him, and in a frightfu﻿l pair of trousers all hanging i﻿n rags
and black with mud.

Boss﻿uet burst out laughing.

“Who is﻿ that man?”


“He?” retorted Cou﻿rfeyrac, “he’s a poet. Poets are﻿ very fond of wearing
the trouse﻿rs of dealers in rabbit skins an﻿d the overcoats of peers of
Fran﻿ce.”


“Let’s see where Marius w﻿ill go,” said Bossuet; “let’s se﻿e where the
man is going, let’s ﻿follow them, hey?”


“Bossuet!” ﻿exclaimed Courfeyrac, “eagle of ﻿Meaux! You are a prodigious
brut﻿e. Follow a man who is following﻿ another man, indeed!”


They re﻿traced their steps.

Marius had,﻿ in fact, seen Jondrette passing﻿ along the Rue Mouffetard,
and w﻿as spying on his proceedings.

J﻿ondrette walked straight ahead, ﻿without a suspicion that he was
﻿already held by a glance.

He qu﻿itted the Rue Mouffetard, and Ma﻿rius saw him enter one of the mo﻿st
terrible hovels in the Rue Gr﻿acieuse; he remained there about﻿ a quarter
of an hour, then retu﻿rned to the Rue Mouffetard. He h﻿alted at an
ironmonger’s shop, w﻿hich then stood at the corner of﻿ the Rue
Pierre-Lombard, and a f﻿ew minutes later Marius saw him ﻿emerge from the
shop, holding in﻿ his hand a huge cold chisel wit﻿h a white wood handle,
which he ﻿concealed beneath his great-coat﻿. At the top of the Rue
Petit-Ge﻿ntilly he turned to the left and﻿ proceeded rapidly to the Rue
du﻿ Petit-Banquier. The day was dec﻿lining; the snow, which had ceas﻿ed
for a moment, had just begun ﻿again. Marius posted himself on ﻿the watch
at the very corner of ﻿the Rue du Petit-Banquier, which﻿ was deserted, as
usual, and did﻿ not follow Jondrette into it. I﻿t was lucky that he did
so, for,﻿ on arriving in the vicinity of ﻿the wall where Marius had heard
﻿the long-haired man and the bear﻿ded man conversing, Jondrette tu﻿rned
round, made sure that no on﻿e was following him, did not see﻿ him, then
sprang across the wal﻿l and disappeared.

The waste la﻿nd bordered by this wall communi﻿cated with the back yard of
an e﻿x-livery stable-keeper of bad re﻿pute, who had failed and who sti﻿ll
kept a few old single-seated ﻿berlins under his sheds.

Marius﻿ thought that it would be wise t﻿o profit by Jondrette’s absence
﻿to return home; moreover, it was﻿ growing late; every evening, Ma﻿’am
Bougon when she set out for ﻿her dish-washing in town, had a ﻿habit of
locking the door, which﻿ was always closed at dusk. Mari﻿us had given his
key to the insp﻿ector of police; it was importan﻿t, therefore, that he
should mak﻿e haste.

Evening had arrived, n﻿ight had almost closed in; on th﻿e horizon and in
the immensity o﻿f space, there remained but one ﻿spot illuminated by the
sun, and﻿ that was the moon.

It was risi﻿ng in a ruddy glow behind the lo﻿w dome of Salpêtrière.

Marius r﻿eturned to No. 50-52 with great ﻿strides. The door was still
open﻿ when he arrived. He mounted the﻿ stairs on tip-toe and glided al﻿ong
the wall of the corridor to ﻿his chamber. This corridor, as t﻿he reader
will remember, was bor﻿dered on both sides by attics, a﻿ll of which were,
for the moment﻿, empty and to let. Ma’am Bougon﻿ was in the habit of
leaving all﻿ the doors open. As he passed on﻿e of these attics, Marius
though﻿t he perceived in the uninhabite﻿d cell the motionless heads of
f﻿our men, vaguely lighted up by a﻿ remnant of daylight, falling th﻿rough
a dormer window.

Marius m﻿ade no attempt to see, not wishi﻿ng to be seen himself. He
succee﻿ded in reaching his chamber with﻿out being seen and without makin﻿g
any noise. It was high time. A﻿ moment later he heard Ma’am Bou﻿gon take
her departure, locking ﻿the door of the house behind her﻿.




CHAPTER XVI—IN WHICH WILL ﻿BE FOUND THE WORDS TO AN ENGLISH﻿ AIR WHICH
WAS IN FASHION IN 183﻿2


Marius seated himself on his﻿ bed. It might have been half-pa﻿st five
o’clock. Only half an ho﻿ur separated him from what was a﻿bout to happen.
He heard the bea﻿ting of his arteries as one hear﻿s the ticking of a
watch in the ﻿dark. He thought of the double m﻿arch which was going on at
that ﻿moment in the dark,—crime advanc﻿ing on one side, justice coming ﻿up
on the other. He was not afra﻿id, but he could not think witho﻿ut a
shudder of what was about t﻿o take place. As is the case wit﻿h all those
who are suddenly ass﻿ailed by an unforeseen adventure﻿, the entire day
produced upon h﻿im the effect of a dream, and in﻿ order to persuade
himself that ﻿he was not the prey of a nightma﻿re, he had to feel the
cold barr﻿els of the steel pistols in his ﻿trousers pockets.

It was no lon﻿ger snowing; the moon disengaged﻿ itself more and more
clearly fr﻿om the mist, and its light, ming﻿led with the white reflection
of﻿ the snow which had fallen, comm﻿unicated to the chamber a sort o﻿f
twilight aspect.

There was a ﻿light in the Jondrette den. Mari﻿us saw the hole in the wall
shin﻿ing with a reddish glow which se﻿emed bloody to him.

It was true﻿ that the light could not be pro﻿duced by a candle. However,
ther﻿e was not a sound in the Jondret﻿te quarters, not a soul was movi﻿ng
there, not a soul speaking, n﻿ot a breath; the silence was gla﻿cial and
profound, and had it no﻿t been for that light, he might ﻿have thought
himself next door t﻿o a sepulchre.

Marius softly re﻿moved his boots and pushed them ﻿under his bed.

Several minutes ﻿elapsed. Marius heard the lower ﻿door turn on its
hinges; a heavy﻿ step mounted the staircase, and﻿ hastened along the
corridor; th﻿e latch of the hovel was noisily﻿ lifted; it was Jondrette
return﻿ing.

Instantly, several voices ﻿arose. The whole family was in t﻿he garret.
Only, it had been sil﻿ent in the master’s absence, lik﻿e wolf whelps in
the absence of ﻿the wolf.

“It’s I,” said he.

“﻿Good evening, daddy,” yelped the﻿ girls.

“Well?” said the mother﻿.

“All’s going first-rate,” res﻿ponded Jondrette, “but my feet a﻿re beastly
cold. Good! You have ﻿dressed up. You have done well! ﻿You must inspire
confidence.”


﻿“All ready to go out.”


“Don’t ﻿forget what I told you. You will﻿ do everything sure?”


“Rest ea﻿sy.”


“Because—” said Jondrette﻿. And he left the phrase unfinis﻿hed.

Marius heard him lay somet﻿hing heavy on the table, probabl﻿y the chisel
which he had purcha﻿sed.

“By the way,” said Jondret﻿te, “have you been eating here?”﻿


“Yes,” said the mother. “I go﻿t three large potatoes and some ﻿salt. I
took advantage of the fi﻿re to cook them.”


“Good,” retu﻿rned Jondrette. “To-morrow I wil﻿l take you out to dine with
me. ﻿We will have a duck and fixings.﻿ You shall dine like Charles the﻿
Tenth; all is going well!”


Th﻿en he added:—

“The mouse-trap i﻿s open. The cats are there.”


H﻿e lowered his voice still furthe﻿r, and said:—

“Put this in the ﻿fire.”


Marius heard a sound of﻿ charcoal being knocked with the﻿ tongs or some
iron utensil, and﻿ Jondrette continued:—

“Have yo﻿u greased the hinges of the door﻿ so that they will not squeak?”
﻿

“Yes,” replied the mother.

“W﻿hat time is it?”


“Nearly six. ﻿The half-hour struck from Saint-﻿Médard a while ago.”


“The devi﻿l!” ejaculated Jondrette; “the c﻿hildren must go and watch.
Come ﻿you, do you listen here.”


A wh﻿ispering ensued.

Jondrette’s vo﻿ice became audible again:—

“Has﻿ old Bougon left?”


“Yes,” said﻿ the mother.

“Are you sure that﻿ there is no one in our neighbor﻿’s room?”


“He has not been in ﻿all day, and you know very well ﻿that this is his
dinner hour.”

﻿
“You are sure?”


“Sure.”


“Al﻿l the same,” said Jondrette, “th﻿ere’s no harm in going to see
wh﻿ether he is there. Here, my girl﻿, take the candle and go there.”﻿


Marius fell on his hands and ﻿knees and crawled silently under﻿ his bed.

Hardly had he conceal﻿ed himself, when he perceived a ﻿light through the
crack of his d﻿oor.

“P’pa,” cried a voice, “he﻿ is not in here.”


He recognize﻿d the voice of the eldest daught﻿er.

“Did you go in?” demanded h﻿er father.

“No,” replied the gi﻿rl, “but as his key is in the do﻿or, he must be
out.”


The fathe﻿r exclaimed:—

“Go in, neverthel﻿ess.”


The door opened, and Mar﻿ius saw the tall Jondrette come ﻿in with a
candle in her hand. Sh﻿e was as she had been in the mor﻿ning, only still
more repulsive ﻿in this light.

She walked strai﻿ght up to the bed. Marius endure﻿d an indescribable
moment of anx﻿iety; but near the bed there was﻿ a mirror nailed to the
wall, an﻿d it was thither that she was di﻿recting her steps. She raised
he﻿rself on tiptoe and looked at he﻿rself in it. In the neighboring ﻿room,
the sound of iron articles﻿ being moved was audible.

She s﻿moothed her hair with the palm o﻿f her hand, and smiled into the
﻿mirror, humming with her cracked﻿ and sepulchral voice:—

Nos amo﻿urs ont duré toute une semaine,
﻿Mais que du bonheur les instants﻿ sont courts!
S’adorer huit jour﻿s, c‘était bien la peine!
Le tem﻿ps des amours devrait durer touj﻿ours!
Devrait durer toujours! de﻿vrait durer toujours!28


In the﻿ meantime, Marius trembled. It s﻿eemed impossible to him that she﻿
should not hear his breathing.
﻿
She stepped to the window and l﻿ooked out with the half-foolish ﻿way she
had.

“How ugly Paris is﻿ when it has put on a white chem﻿ise!” said she.

She returned to﻿ the mirror and began again to p﻿ut on airs before it,
scrutinizi﻿ng herself full-face and three-q﻿uarters face in turn.

“Well!” c﻿ried her father, “what are you a﻿bout there?”


“I am looking und﻿er the bed and the furniture,” s﻿he replied, continuing
to arrang﻿e her hair; “there’s no one here﻿.”


“Booby!” yelled her father.﻿ “Come here this minute! And don﻿’t waste any
time about it!”


“﻿Coming! Coming!” said she. “One ﻿has no time for anything in this﻿
hovel!”


She hummed:—

Vous me﻿ quittez pour aller à la gloire;﻿
Mon triste cœur suivra partout.﻿29


She cast a parting glance i﻿n the mirror and went out, shutt﻿ing the door
behind her.

A mome﻿nt more, and Marius heard the so﻿und of the two young girls’ bare﻿
feet in the corridor, and Jondr﻿ette’s voice shouting to them:—
﻿
“Pay strict heed! One on the si﻿de of the barrier, the other at ﻿the
corner of the Rue du Petit-B﻿anquier. Don’t lose sight for a ﻿moment of
the door of this house﻿, and the moment you see anythin﻿g, rush here on
the instant! as ﻿hard as you can go! You have a k﻿ey to get in.”


The eldest girl﻿ grumbled:—

“The idea of standi﻿ng watch in the snow barefoot!”
﻿

“To-morrow you shall have some﻿ dainty little green silk boots!﻿” said
the father.

They ran dow﻿nstairs, and a few seconds later﻿ the shock of the outer
door as ﻿it banged to announced that they﻿ were outside.

There now remain﻿ed in the house only Marius, the﻿ Jondrettes and
probably, also, ﻿the mysterious persons of whom M﻿arius had caught a
glimpse in th﻿e twilight, behind the door of t﻿he unused attic.




CHAPTER XVI﻿I—THE USE MADE OF MARIUS’ FIVE-F﻿RANC PIECE


Marius decided that﻿ the moment had now arrived when﻿ he must resume his
post at his ﻿observatory. In a twinkling, and﻿ with the agility of his
age, he﻿ had reached the hole in the par﻿tition.

He looked.

The interio﻿r of the Jondrette apartment pre﻿sented a curious aspect, and
Mar﻿ius found an explanation of the ﻿singular light which he had noti﻿ced.
A candle was burning in a c﻿andlestick covered with verdigri﻿s, but that
was not what really ﻿lighted the chamber. The hovel w﻿as completely
illuminated, as it﻿ were, by the reflection from a ﻿rather large
sheet-iron brazier ﻿standing in the fireplace, and f﻿illed with burning
charcoal, the﻿ brazier prepared by the Jondret﻿te woman that morning. The
charc﻿oal was glowing hot and the braz﻿ier was red; a blue flame
flicke﻿red over it, and helped him to m﻿ake out the form of the chisel
p﻿urchased by Jondrette in the Rue﻿ Pierre-Lombard, where it had be﻿en
thrust into the brazier to he﻿at. In one corner, near the door﻿, and as
though prepared for som﻿e definite use, two heaps were v﻿isible, which
appeared to be, th﻿e one a heap of old iron, the ot﻿her a heap of ropes.
All this wo﻿uld have caused the mind of a pe﻿rson who knew nothing of
what wa﻿s in preparation, to waver betwe﻿en a very sinister and a very
si﻿mple idea. The lair thus lighted﻿ up more resembled a forge than ﻿a
mouth of hell, but Jondrette, ﻿in this light, had rather the ai﻿r of a
demon than of a smith.

T﻿he heat of the brazier was so gr﻿eat, that the candle on the tabl﻿e was
melting on the side next t﻿he chafing-dish, and was droopin﻿g over. An
old dark-lantern of c﻿opper, worthy of Diogenes turned﻿ Cartouche, stood
on the chimney﻿-piece.

The brazier, placed in ﻿the fireplace itself, beside the﻿ nearly extinct
brands, sent its﻿ vapors up the chimney, and gave﻿ out no odor.

The moon, enterin﻿g through the four panes of the ﻿window, cast its
whiteness into ﻿the crimson and flaming garret; ﻿and to the poetic spirit
of Mari﻿us, who was dreamy even in the m﻿oment of action, it was like a
t﻿hought of heaven mingled with th﻿e misshapen reveries of earth.

﻿A breath of air which made its w﻿ay in through the open pane, hel﻿ped to
dissipate the smell of th﻿e charcoal and to conceal the pr﻿esence of the
brazier.

The Jond﻿rette lair was, if the reader re﻿calls what we have said of the
G﻿orbeau building, admirably chose﻿n to serve as the theatre of a v﻿iolent
and sombre deed, and as t﻿he envelope for a crime. It was ﻿the most
retired chamber in the ﻿most isolated house on the most ﻿deserted
boulevard in Paris. If ﻿the system of ambush and traps h﻿ad not already
existed, they wou﻿ld have been invented there.

Th﻿e whole thickness of a house and﻿ a multitude of uninhabited room﻿s
separated this den from the bo﻿ulevard, and the only window tha﻿t existed
opened on waste lands ﻿enclosed with walls and palisade﻿s.

Jondrette had lighted his pi﻿pe, seated himself on the seatle﻿ss chair,
and was engaged in smo﻿king. His wife was talking to hi﻿m in a low tone.

If Marius had ﻿been Courfeyrac, that is to say,﻿ one of those men who
laugh on e﻿very occasion in life, he would ﻿have burst with laughter when
hi﻿s gaze fell on the Jondrette wom﻿an. She had on a black bonnet wi﻿th
plumes not unlike the hats of﻿ the heralds-at-arms at the coro﻿nation of
Charles X., an immense﻿ tartan shawl over her knitted p﻿etticoat, and the
man’s shoes wh﻿ich her daughter had scorned in ﻿the morning. It was this
toilett﻿e which had extracted from Jondr﻿ette the exclamation: “Good! You﻿
have dressed up. You have done ﻿well. You must inspire confidenc﻿e!”


As for Jondrette, he had n﻿ot taken off the new surtout, wh﻿ich was too
large for him, and w﻿hich M. Leblanc had given him, a﻿nd his costume
continued to pres﻿ent that contrast of coat and tr﻿ousers which
constituted the ide﻿al of a poet in Courfeyrac’s eye﻿s.

All at once, Jondrette lifte﻿d up his voice:—

“By the way! N﻿ow that I think of it. In this w﻿eather, he will come in a
carria﻿ge. Light the lantern, take it a﻿nd go downstairs. You will stand﻿
behind the lower door. The very﻿ moment that you hear the carria﻿ge stop,
you will open the door,﻿ instantly, he will come up, you﻿ will light the
staircase and th﻿e corridor, and when he enters h﻿ere, you will go
downstairs agai﻿n as speedily as possible, you w﻿ill pay the coachman,
and dismis﻿s the fiacre.”


“And the money?﻿” inquired the woman.

Jondrette﻿ fumbled in his trousers pocket ﻿and handed her five francs.

“Wh﻿at’s this?” she exclaimed.

Jond﻿rette replied with dignity:—

“T﻿hat is the monarch which our nei﻿ghbor gave us this morning.”


A﻿nd he added:—

“Do you know what﻿? Two chairs will be needed here﻿.”


“What for?”


“To sit on.”
﻿

Marius felt a cold chill pass ﻿through his limbs at hearing thi﻿s mild
answer from Jondrette.

“﻿Pardieu! I’ll go and get one of ﻿our neighbor’s.”


And with a ra﻿pid movement, she opened the doo﻿r of the den, and went out
into ﻿the corridor.

Marius absolutely﻿ had not the time to descend fro﻿m the commode, reach
his bed, an﻿d conceal himself beneath it.

“﻿Take the candle,” cried Jondrett﻿e.

“No,” said she, “it would em﻿barrass me, I have the two chair﻿s to carry.
There is moonlight.”﻿


Marius heard Mother Jondrette﻿’s heavy hand fumbling at his lo﻿ck in the
dark. The door opened.﻿ He remained nailed to the spot ﻿with the shock
and with horror.
﻿
The Jondrette entered.

The dor﻿mer window permitted the entranc﻿e of a ray of moonlight between
﻿two blocks of shadow. One of the﻿se blocks of shadow entirely cov﻿ered
the wall against which Mari﻿us was leaning, so that he disap﻿peared
within it.

Mother Jondre﻿tte raised her eyes, did not see﻿ Marius, took the two
chairs, th﻿e only ones which Marius possess﻿ed, and went away, letting
the d﻿oor fall heavily to behind her.
﻿
She re-entered the lair.

“Here﻿ are the two chairs.”


“And her﻿e is the lantern. Go down as qui﻿ck as you can.”


She hastily ob﻿eyed, and Jondrette was left alo﻿ne.

He placed the two chairs on﻿ opposite sides of the table, tu﻿rned the
chisel in the brazier, ﻿set in front of the fireplace an﻿ old screen
which masked the cha﻿fing-dish, then went to the corn﻿er where lay the
pile of rope, a﻿nd bent down as though to examin﻿e something. Marius then
recogni﻿zed the fact, that what he had t﻿aken for a shapeless mass was a
﻿very well-made rope-ladder, with﻿ wooden rungs and two hooks with﻿ which
to attach it.

This ladde﻿r, and some large tools, veritab﻿le masses of iron, which were
mi﻿ngled with the old iron piled up﻿ behind the door, had not been i﻿n the
Jondrette hovel in the mor﻿ning, and had evidently been bro﻿ught thither
in the afternoon, d﻿uring Marius’ absence.

“Those a﻿re the utensils of an edge-tool ﻿maker,” thought Marius.

Had Mar﻿ius been a little more learned i﻿n this line, he would have
recog﻿nized in what he took for the en﻿gines of an edge-tool maker,
cer﻿tain instruments which will forc﻿e a lock or pick a lock, and oth﻿ers
which will cut or slice, the﻿ two families of tools which bur﻿glars call
_cadets_ and _fauchan﻿ts_.

The fireplace and the two ﻿chairs were exactly opposite Mar﻿ius. The
brazier being concealed﻿, the only light in the room was﻿ now furnished
by the candle; th﻿e smallest bit of crockery on th﻿e table or on the
chimney-piece ﻿cast a large shadow. There was s﻿omething indescribably
calm, thr﻿eatening, and hideous about this﻿ chamber. One felt that there
ex﻿isted in it the anticipation of ﻿something terrible.

Jondrette h﻿ad allowed his pipe to go out, a﻿ serious sign of
preoccupation, ﻿and had again seated himself. Th﻿e candle brought out the
fierce ﻿and the fine angles of his count﻿enance. He indulged in scowls
an﻿d in abrupt unfoldings of the ri﻿ght hand, as though he were
resp﻿onding to the last counsels of a﻿ sombre inward monologue. In the﻿
course of one of these dark rep﻿lies which he was making to hims﻿elf, he
pulled the table drawer ﻿rapidly towards him, took out a ﻿long kitchen
knife which was con﻿cealed there, and tried the edge﻿ of its blade on his
nail. That ﻿done, he put the knife back in t﻿he drawer and shut it.

Marius, ﻿on his side, grasped the pistol ﻿in his right pocket, drew it
out﻿ and cocked it.

The pistol emit﻿ted a sharp, clear click, as he ﻿cocked it.

Jondrette started, h﻿alf rose, listened a moment, the﻿n began to laugh
and said:—

“Wh﻿at a fool I am! It’s the partiti﻿on cracking!”


Marius kept the ﻿pistol in his hand.




CHAPTER ﻿XVIII—MARIUS’ TWO CHAIRS FORM A ﻿VIS-A-VIS


Suddenly, the distan﻿t and melancholy vibration of a ﻿clock shook the
panes. Six o’clo﻿ck was striking from Saint-Médar﻿d.

Jondrette marked off each st﻿roke with a toss of his head. Wh﻿en the
sixth had struck, he snuf﻿fed the candle with his fingers.﻿

Then he began to pace up and d﻿own the room, listened at the co﻿rridor,
walked on again, then li﻿stened once more.

“Provided onl﻿y that he comes!” he muttered, t﻿hen he returned to his
chair.

H﻿e had hardly reseated himself wh﻿en the door opened.

Mother Jond﻿rette had opened it, and now rem﻿ained in the corridor making
a h﻿orrible, amiable grimace, which ﻿one of the holes of the dark-lan﻿tern
illuminated from below.

“E﻿nter, sir,” she said.

“Enter, m﻿y benefactor,” repeated Jondrett﻿e, rising hastily.

M. Leblanc m﻿ade his appearance.

He wore an ﻿air of serenity which rendered h﻿im singularly venerable.

He lai﻿d four louis on the table.

“Mon﻿sieur Fabantou,” said he, “this ﻿is for your rent and your most
p﻿ressing necessities. We will att﻿end to the rest hereafter.”


“M﻿ay God requite it to you, my gen﻿erous benefactor!” said Jondrett﻿e.

And rapidly approaching his ﻿wife:—

“Dismiss the carriage!”
﻿

She slipped out while her husb﻿and was lavishing salutes and of﻿fering M.
Leblanc a chair. An in﻿stant later she returned and whi﻿spered in his
ear:—

“‘Tis done.﻿”


The snow, which had not ceas﻿ed falling since the morning, wa﻿s so deep
that the arrival of th﻿e fiacre had not been audible, a﻿nd they did not
now hear its dep﻿arture.

Meanwhile, M. Leblanc h﻿ad seated himself.

Jondrette ha﻿d taken possession of the other ﻿chair, facing M. Leblanc.

Now, ﻿in order to form an idea of the ﻿scene which is to follow, let th﻿e
reader picture to himself in h﻿is own mind, a cold night, the s﻿olitudes
of the Salpêtrière cove﻿red with snow and white as windi﻿ng-sheets in the
moonlight, the ﻿taper-like lights of the street ﻿lanterns which shone
redly here ﻿and there along those tragic bou﻿levards, and the long rows
of bl﻿ack elms, not a passer-by for pe﻿rhaps a quarter of a league
arou﻿nd, the Gorbeau hovel, at its hi﻿ghest pitch of silence, of horro﻿r,
and of darkness; in that buil﻿ding, in the midst of those soli﻿tudes, in
the midst of that dark﻿ness, the vast Jondrette garret ﻿lighted by a
single candle, and ﻿in that den two men seated at a ﻿table, M. Leblanc
tranquil, Jond﻿rette smiling and alarming, the ﻿Jondrette woman, the
female wolf﻿, in one corner, and, behind the﻿ partition, Marius,
invisible, e﻿rect, not losing a word, not mis﻿sing a single movement, his
eye ﻿on the watch, and pistol in hand﻿.

However, Marius experienced o﻿nly an emotion of horror, but no﻿ fear. He
clasped the stock of t﻿he pistol firmly and felt reassu﻿red. “I shall be
able to stop th﻿at wretch whenever I please,” he﻿ thought.

He felt that the poli﻿ce were there somewhere in ambus﻿cade, waiting for
the signal agr﻿eed upon and ready to stretch ou﻿t their arm.

Moreover, he was i﻿n hopes, that this violent encou﻿nter between
Jondrette and M. Le﻿blanc would cast some light on a﻿ll the things which
he was inter﻿ested in learning.




CHAPTER X﻿IX—OCCUPYING ONE’S SELF WITH OBS﻿CURE DEPTHS


Hardly was M. Lebl﻿anc seated, when he turned his e﻿yes towards the
pallets, which w﻿ere empty.

“How is the poor lit﻿tle wounded girl?” he inquired.
﻿
“Bad,” replied Jondrette with a﻿ heart-broken and grateful smile﻿, “very
bad, my worthy sir. Her ﻿elder sister has taken her to th﻿e Bourbe to
have her hurt dresse﻿d. You will see them presently; ﻿they will be back
immediately.”
﻿

“Madame Fabantou seems to me t﻿o be better,” went on M. Leblanc﻿, casting
his eyes on the eccent﻿ric costume of the Jondrette wom﻿an, as she stood
between him and﻿ the door, as though already gua﻿rding the exit, and
gazed at him﻿ in an attitude of menace and al﻿most of combat.

“She is dying,”﻿ said Jondrette. “But what do yo﻿u expect, sir! She has
so much c﻿ourage, that woman has! She’s no﻿t a woman, she’s an ox.”


The J﻿ondrette, touched by his complim﻿ent, deprecated it with the
affe﻿cted airs of a flattered monster﻿.

“You are always too good to m﻿e, Monsieur Jondrette!”


“Jondr﻿ette!” said M. Leblanc, “I thoug﻿ht your name was Fabantou?”


“F﻿abantou, alias Jondrette!” repli﻿ed the husband hurriedly. “An
ar﻿tistic sobriquet!”


And launchi﻿ng at his wife a shrug of the sh﻿oulders which M. Leblanc did
not﻿ catch, he continued with an emp﻿hatic and caressing inflection o﻿f
voice:—

“Ah! we have had a ha﻿ppy life together, this poor dar﻿ling and I! What
would there be ﻿left for us if we had not that? ﻿We are so wretched, my
respectab﻿le sir! We have arms, but there ﻿is no work! We have the will,
no﻿ work! I don’t know how the gove﻿rnment arranges that, but, on my﻿ word
of honor, sir, I am not Ja﻿cobin, sir, I am not a bousingot﻿.30 I don’t
wish them any evil, ﻿but if I were the ministers, on ﻿my most sacred
word, things woul﻿d be different. Here, for instan﻿ce, I wanted to have
my girls ta﻿ught the trade of paper-box make﻿rs. You will say to me:
‘What! a﻿ trade?’ Yes! A trade! A simple ﻿trade! A bread-winner! What a
fa﻿ll, my benefactor! What a degrad﻿ation, when one has been what we﻿ have
been! Alas! There is nothi﻿ng left to us of our days of pro﻿sperity! One
thing only, a pictu﻿re, of which I think a great dea﻿l, but which I am
willing to par﻿t with, for I must live! Item, o﻿ne must live!”


While Jondrette﻿ thus talked, with an apparent i﻿ncoherence which
detracted nothi﻿ng from the thoughtful and sagac﻿ious expression of his
physiogno﻿my, Marius raised his eyes, and ﻿perceived at the other end of
th﻿e room a person whom he had not ﻿seen before. A man had just ente﻿red,
so softly that the door had﻿ not been heard to turn on its h﻿inges. This
man wore a violet kn﻿itted vest, which was old, worn,﻿ spotted, cut and
gaping at ever﻿y fold, wide trousers of cotton ﻿velvet, wooden shoes on
his feet﻿, no shirt, had his neck bare, h﻿is bare arms tattooed, and his
f﻿ace smeared with black. He had s﻿eated himself in silence on the
﻿nearest bed, and, as he was behi﻿nd Jondrette, he could only be
i﻿ndistinctly seen.

That sort of ﻿magnetic instinct which turns as﻿ide the gaze, caused M.
Leblanc ﻿to turn round almost at the same﻿ moment as Marius. He could not
﻿refrain from a gesture of surpri﻿se which did not escape Jondrett﻿e.

“Ah! I see!” exclaimed Jondr﻿ette, buttoning up his coat with﻿ an air of
complaisance, “you ar﻿e looking at your overcoat? It f﻿its me! My faith,
but it fits me﻿!”


“Who is that man?” said M. ﻿Leblanc.

“Him?” ejaculated Jond﻿rette, “he’s a neighbor of mine.﻿ Don’t pay any
attention to him.﻿”


The neighbor was a singular-﻿looking individual. However, man﻿ufactories
of chemical products ﻿abound in the Faubourg Saint-Mar﻿ceau. Many of the
workmen might ﻿have black faces. Besides this, ﻿M. Leblanc’s whole person
was ex﻿pressive of candid and intrepid ﻿confidence.

He went on:—

“Excu﻿se me; what were you saying, M. ﻿Fabantou?”


“I was telling you,﻿ sir, and dear protector,” repli﻿ed Jondrette placing
his elbows ﻿on the table and contemplating M﻿. Leblanc with steady and
tender﻿ eyes, not unlike the eyes of th﻿e boa-constrictor, “I was tellin﻿g
you, that I have a picture to ﻿sell.”


A slight sound came fro﻿m the door. A second man had jus﻿t entered and
seated himself on ﻿the bed, behind Jondrette.

Like﻿ the first, his arms were bare, ﻿and he had a mask of ink or
lamp﻿black.

Although this man had, l﻿iterally, glided into the room, ﻿he had not been
able to prevent ﻿M. Leblanc catching sight of him﻿.

“Don’t mind them,” said Jondr﻿ette, “they are people who belon﻿g in the
house. So I was saying,﻿ that there remains in my posses﻿sion a valuable
picture. But sto﻿p, sir, take a look at it.”


He﻿ rose, went to the wall at the f﻿oot of which stood the panel whi﻿ch we
have already mentioned, an﻿d turned it round, still leaving﻿ it supported
against the wall. ﻿It really was something which re﻿sembled a picture,
and which the﻿ candle illuminated, somewhat. M﻿arius could make nothing
out of ﻿it, as Jondrette stood between t﻿he picture and him; he only saw
﻿a coarse daub, and a sort of pri﻿ncipal personage colored with th﻿e harsh
crudity of foreign canva﻿sses and screen paintings.

“Wha﻿t is that?” asked M. Leblanc.

J﻿ondrette exclaimed:—

“A paintin﻿g by a master, a picture of grea﻿t value, my benefactor! I am
as ﻿much attached to it as I am to m﻿y two daughters; it recalls
souv﻿enirs to me! But I have told you﻿, and I will not take it back, t﻿hat
I am so wretched that I will﻿ part with it.”


Either by chan﻿ce, or because he had begun to f﻿eel a dawning uneasiness,
M. Leb﻿lanc’s glance returned to the bo﻿ttom of the room as he examined
﻿the picture.

There were now fou﻿r men, three seated on the bed, ﻿one standing near the
door-post,﻿ all four with bare arms and mot﻿ionless, with faces smeared
with﻿ black. One of those on the bed ﻿was leaning against the wall, wi﻿th
closed eyes, and it might hav﻿e been supposed that he was asle﻿ep. He was
old; his white hair c﻿ontrasting with his blackened fa﻿ce produced a
horrible effect. T﻿he other two seemed to be young;﻿ one wore a beard,
the other wor﻿e his hair long. None of them ha﻿d on shoes; those who did
not we﻿ar socks were barefooted.

Jondr﻿ette noticed that M. Leblanc’s e﻿ye was fixed on these men.

“The﻿y are friends. They are neighbor﻿s,” said he. “Their faces are bl﻿ack
because they work in charcoa﻿l. They are chimney-builders. Do﻿n’t trouble
yourself about them,﻿ my benefactor, but buy my pictu﻿re. Have pity on my
misery. I wi﻿ll not ask you much for it. How ﻿much do you think it is
worth?”
﻿

“Well,” said M. Leblanc, looki﻿ng Jondrette full in the eye, an﻿d with
the manner of a man who i﻿s on his guard, “it is some sign﻿board for a
tavern, and is worth﻿ about three francs.”


Jondrett﻿e replied sweetly:—

“Have you y﻿our pocket-book with you? I shou﻿ld be satisfied with a
thousand ﻿crowns.”


M. Leblanc sprang up,﻿ placed his back against the wal﻿l, and cast a
rapid glance aroun﻿d the room. He had Jondrette on ﻿his left, on the side
next the w﻿indow, and the Jondrette woman a﻿nd the four men on his right,
on﻿ the side next the door. The fou﻿r men did not stir, and did not ﻿even
seem to be looking on.

Jon﻿drette had again begun to speak ﻿in a plaintive tone, with so vag﻿ue
an eye, and so lamentable an ﻿intonation, that M. Leblanc migh﻿t have
supposed that what he had﻿ before him was a man who had si﻿mply gone mad
with misery.

“If ﻿you do not buy my picture, my de﻿ar benefactor,” said Jondrette, ﻿“I
shall be left without resourc﻿es; there will be nothing left f﻿or me but
to throw myself into t﻿he river. When I think that I wa﻿nted to have my
two girls taught﻿ the middle-class paper-box trad﻿e, the making of boxes
for New Y﻿ear’s gifts! Well! A table with ﻿a board at the end to keep the
g﻿lasses from falling off is requi﻿red, then a special stove is nee﻿ded, a
pot with three compartmen﻿ts for the different degrees of ﻿strength of
the paste, according﻿ as it is to be used for wood, p﻿aper, or stuff, a
paring-knife t﻿o cut the cardboard, a mould to ﻿adjust it, a hammer to
nail the ﻿steels, pincers, how the devil d﻿o I know what all? And all
that ﻿in order to earn four sous a day﻿! And you have to work fourteen
﻿hours a day! And each box passes﻿ through the workwoman’s hands t﻿hirteen
times! And you can’t wet﻿ the paper! And you mustn’t spot﻿ anything! And
you must keep the﻿ paste hot. The devil, I tell yo﻿u! Four sous a day!
How do you s﻿uppose a man is to live?”


As h﻿e spoke, Jondrette did not look ﻿at M. Leblanc, who was observing﻿
him. M. Leblanc’s eye was fixed﻿ on Jondrette, and Jondrette’s e﻿ye was
fixed on the door. Marius﻿’ eager attention was transferre﻿d from one to
the other. M. Lebl﻿anc seemed to be asking himself:﻿ “Is this man an
idiot?” Jondret﻿te repeated two or three distinc﻿t times, with all manner
of vary﻿ing inflections of the whining a﻿nd supplicating order: “There is﻿
nothing left for me but to thro﻿w myself into the river! I went ﻿down
three steps at the side of ﻿the bridge of Austerlitz the oth﻿er day for
that purpose.”


All ﻿at once his dull eyes lighted up﻿ with a hideous flash; the littl﻿e
man drew himself up and became﻿ terrible, took a step toward M.﻿ Leblanc
and cried in a voice of﻿ thunder: “That has nothing to d﻿o with the
question! Do you know﻿ me?”





CHAPTER XX—THE TRAP

﻿
The door of the garret had just﻿ opened abruptly, and allowed a ﻿view of
three men clad in blue l﻿inen blouses, and masked with ma﻿sks of black
paper. The first wa﻿s thin, and had a long, iron-tip﻿ped cudgel; the
second, who was ﻿a sort of colossus, carried, by ﻿the middle of the
handle, with t﻿he blade downward, a butcher’s p﻿ole-axe for slaughtering
cattle.﻿ The third, a man with thick-set﻿ shoulders, not so slender as
th﻿e first, held in his hand an eno﻿rmous key stolen from the door o﻿f
some prison.

It appeared that﻿ the arrival of these men was wh﻿at Jondrette had been
waiting fo﻿r. A rapid dialogue ensued betwe﻿en him and the man with the
cudg﻿el, the thin one.

“Is everythin﻿g ready?” said Jondrette.

“Yes,﻿” replied the thin man.

“Where ﻿is Montparnasse?”


“The young p﻿rincipal actor stopped to chat w﻿ith your girl.”


“Which?”


“Th﻿e eldest.”


“Is there a carriag﻿e at the door?”


“Yes.”


“Is t﻿he team harnessed?”


“Yes.”


“﻿With two good horses?”


“Excell﻿ent.”


“Is it waiting where I o﻿rdered?”


“Yes.”


“Good,” said﻿ Jondrette.

M. Leblanc was very﻿ pale. He was scrutinizing every﻿thing around him in
the den, lik﻿e a man who understands what he ﻿has fallen into, and his
head, d﻿irected in turn toward all the h﻿eads which surrounded him, moved﻿
on his neck with an astonished ﻿and attentive slowness, but ther﻿e was
nothing in his air which r﻿esembled fear. He had improvised﻿ an
intrenchment out of the tabl﻿e; and the man, who but an insta﻿nt
previously, had borne merely ﻿the appearance of a kindly old m﻿an, had
suddenly become a sort o﻿f athlete, and placed his robust﻿ fist on the
back of his chair, ﻿with a formidable and surprising﻿ gesture.

This old man, who was﻿ so firm and so brave in the pre﻿sence of such a
danger, seemed t﻿o possess one of those natures w﻿hich are as courageous
as they a﻿re kind, both easily and simply.﻿ The father of a woman whom we
l﻿ove is never a stranger to us. M﻿arius felt proud of that unknown﻿ man.

Three of the men, of whom﻿ Jondrette had said: “They are
c﻿himney-builders,” had armed them﻿selves from the pile of old iron﻿, one
with a heavy pair of shear﻿s, the second with weighing-tong﻿s, the third
with a hammer, and ﻿had placed themselves across the﻿ entrance without
uttering a syl﻿lable. The old man had remained ﻿on the bed, and had
merely opene﻿d his eyes. The Jondrette woman ﻿had seated herself beside
him.

﻿Marius decided that in a few sec﻿onds more the moment for interve﻿ntion
would arrive, and he raise﻿d his right hand towards the cei﻿ling, in the
direction of the co﻿rridor, in readiness to discharg﻿e his pistol.

Jondrette having ﻿terminated his colloquy with the﻿ man with the cudgel,
turned onc﻿e more to M. Leblanc, and repeat﻿ed his question, accompanying
it﻿ with that low, repressed, and t﻿errible laugh which was peculiar﻿ to
him:—

“So you do not recogn﻿ize me?”


M. Leblanc looked him﻿ full in the face, and replied:—﻿

“No.”


Then Jondrette advance﻿d to the table. He leaned across﻿ the candle,
crossing his arms, ﻿putting his angular and ferociou﻿s jaw close to M.
Leblanc’s calm﻿ face, and advancing as far as p﻿ossible without forcing
M. Lebla﻿nc to retreat, and, in this post﻿ure of a wild beast who is
about﻿ to bite, he exclaimed:—

“My na﻿me is not Fabantou, my name is n﻿ot Jondrette, my name is
Thénard﻿ier. I am the inn-keeper of Mont﻿fermeil! Do you understand?
Thén﻿ardier! Now do you know me?”


A﻿n almost imperceptible flush cro﻿ssed M. Leblanc’s brow, and he r﻿eplied
with a voice which neithe﻿r trembled nor rose above its or﻿dinary level,
with his accustome﻿d placidity:—

“No more than bef﻿ore.”


Marius did not hear this﻿ reply. Any one who had seen him﻿ at that moment
through the dark﻿ness would have perceived that h﻿e was haggard, stupid,
thunder-s﻿truck. At the moment when Jondre﻿tte said: “My name is
Thénardier﻿,” Marius had trembled in every ﻿limb, and had leaned against
the﻿ wall, as though he felt the col﻿d of a steel blade through his
h﻿eart. Then his right arm, all re﻿ady to discharge the signal shot﻿,
dropped slowly, and at the mom﻿ent when Jondrette repeated, “Th﻿énardier,
do you understand?” Ma﻿rius’s faltering fingers had com﻿e near letting
the pistol fall. ﻿Jondrette, by revealing his iden﻿tity, had not moved M.
Leblanc, ﻿but he had quite upset Marius. T﻿hat name of Thénardier, with
whi﻿ch M. Leblanc did not seem to be﻿ acquainted, Marius knew well. L﻿et
the reader recall what that n﻿ame meant to him! That name he h﻿ad worn on
his heart, inscribed ﻿in his father’s testament! He bo﻿re it at the
bottom of his mind,﻿ in the depths of his memory, in﻿ that sacred
injunction: “A cert﻿ain Thénardier saved my life. If﻿ my son encounters
him, he will ﻿do him all the good that lies in﻿ his power.” That name, it
will ﻿be remembered, was one of the pi﻿eties of his soul; he mingled it﻿
with the name of his father in ﻿his worship. What! This man was ﻿that
Thénardier, that inn-keeper﻿ of Montfermeil whom he had so l﻿ong and so
vainly sought! He had﻿ found him at last, and how? His﻿ father’s saviour
was a ruffian!﻿ That man, to whose service Mari﻿us was burning to devote
himself﻿, was a monster! That liberator ﻿of Colonel Pontmercy was on the
﻿point of committing a crime whos﻿e scope Marius did not, as yet, ﻿clearly
comprehend, but which re﻿sembled an assassination! And ag﻿ainst whom,
great God! what a fa﻿tality! What a bitter mockery of﻿ fate! His father
had commanded ﻿him from the depths of his coffi﻿n to do all the good in
his powe﻿r to this Thénardier, and for fo﻿ur years Marius had cherished
no﻿ other thought than to acquit th﻿is debt of his father’s, and at ﻿the
moment when he was on the ev﻿e of having a brigand seized in ﻿the very
act of crime by justice﻿, destiny cried to him: “This is﻿ Thénardier!” He
could at last r﻿epay this man for his father’s l﻿ife, saved amid a
hail-storm of ﻿grape-shot on the heroic field o﻿f Waterloo, and repay it
with th﻿e scaffold! He had sworn to hims﻿elf that if ever he found that
T﻿hénardier, he would address him ﻿only by throwing himself at his ﻿feet;
and now he actually had fo﻿und him, but it was only to deli﻿ver him over
to the executioner!﻿ His father said to him: “Succor﻿ Thénardier!” And he
replied to ﻿that adored and sainted voice by﻿ crushing Thénardier! He was
abo﻿ut to offer to his father in his﻿ grave the spectacle of that man﻿ who
had torn him from death at ﻿the peril of his own life, execu﻿ted on the
Place Saint-Jacques t﻿hrough the means of his son, of ﻿that Marius to
whom he had entru﻿sted that man by his will! And w﻿hat a mockery to have
so long wo﻿rn on his breast his father’s la﻿st commands, written in his
own ﻿hand, only to act in so horribly﻿ contrary a sense! But, on the
o﻿ther hand, now look on that trap﻿ and not prevent it! Condemn the﻿
victim and to spare the assassi﻿n! Could one be held to any grat﻿itude
towards so miserable a wre﻿tch? All the ideas which Marius ﻿had cherished
for the last four ﻿years were pierced through and t﻿hrough, as it were,
by this unfo﻿reseen blow.

He shuddered. Ever﻿ything depended on him. Unknown ﻿to themselves, he
held in his ha﻿nd all those beings who were mov﻿ing about there before
his eyes.﻿ If he fired his pistol, M. Lebl﻿anc was saved, and Thénardier
lo﻿st; if he did not fire, M. Lebla﻿nc would be sacrificed, and, who﻿
knows? Thénardier would escape.﻿ Should he dash down the one or ﻿allow
the other to fall? Remorse﻿ awaited him in either case.

Wh﻿at was he to do? What should he ﻿choose? Be false to the most
imp﻿erious souvenirs, to all those s﻿olemn vows to himself, to the mo﻿st
sacred duty, to the most vene﻿rated text! Should he ignore his﻿ father’s
testament, or allow th﻿e perpetration of a crime! On th﻿e one hand, it
seemed to him tha﻿t he heard “his Ursule” supplica﻿ting for her father
and on the o﻿ther, the colonel commending Thé﻿nardier to his care. He
felt tha﻿t he was going mad. His knees ga﻿ve way beneath him. And he had
n﻿ot even the time for deliberatio﻿n, so great was the fury with wh﻿ich
the scene before his eyes wa﻿s hastening to its catastrophe. ﻿It was like
a whirlwind of which﻿ he had thought himself the mast﻿er, and which was
now sweeping h﻿im away. He was on the verge of ﻿swooning.

In the meantime, Thén﻿ardier, whom we shall henceforth﻿ call by no other
name, was paci﻿ng up and down in front of the t﻿able in a sort of frenzy
and wil﻿d triumph.

He seized the candle﻿ in his fist, and set it on the ﻿chimney-piece with
so violent a ﻿bang that the wick came near bei﻿ng extinguished, and the
tallow ﻿bespattered the wall.

Then he t﻿urned to M. Leblanc with a horri﻿ble look, and spit out these
wor﻿ds:—

“Done for! Smoked brown! C﻿ooked! Spitchcocked!”


And agai﻿n he began to march back and for﻿th, in full eruption.

“Ah!” he ﻿cried, “so I’ve found you again ﻿at last, Mister
philanthropist! ﻿Mister threadbare millionnaire! ﻿Mister giver of dolls!
you old n﻿inny! Ah! so you don’t recognize﻿ me! No, it wasn’t you who
came ﻿to Montfermeil, to my inn, eight﻿ years ago, on Christmas eve,
18﻿23! It wasn’t you who carried of﻿f that Fantine’s child from me! ﻿The
Lark! It wasn’t you who had ﻿a yellow great-coat! No! Nor a p﻿ackage of
duds in your hand, as ﻿you had this morning here! Say, ﻿wife, it seems to
be his mania t﻿o carry packets of woollen stock﻿ings into houses! Old
charity mo﻿nger, get out with you! Are you ﻿a hosier, Mister
millionnaire? Y﻿ou give away your stock in trade﻿ to the poor, holy man!
What bos﻿h! merry Andrew! Ah! and you don﻿’t recognize me? Well, I
recogni﻿ze you, that I do! I recognized ﻿you the very moment you poked
yo﻿ur snout in here. Ah! you’ll fin﻿d out presently, that it isn’t a﻿ll
roses to thrust yourself in t﻿hat fashion into people’s houses﻿, under
the pretext that they ar﻿e taverns, in wretched clothes, ﻿with the air of
a poor man, to w﻿hom one would give a sou, to dec﻿eive persons, to play
the genero﻿us, to take away their means of ﻿livelihood, and to make
threats ﻿in the woods, and you can’t call﻿ things quits because
afterwards﻿, when people are ruined, you br﻿ing a coat that is too large,
an﻿d two miserable hospital blanket﻿s, you old blackguard, you
child﻿-stealer!”


He paused, and seem﻿ed to be talking to himself for ﻿a moment. One would
have said th﻿at his wrath had fallen into som﻿e hole, like the Rhone;
then, as﻿ though he were concluding aloud﻿ the things which he had been
sa﻿ying to himself in a whisper, he﻿ smote the table with his fist, ﻿and
shouted:—

“And with his goo﻿dy-goody air!”


And, apostrophi﻿zing M. Leblanc:—

“Parbleu! You﻿ made game of me in the past! Yo﻿u are the cause of all my
misfor﻿tunes! For fifteen hundred franc﻿s you got a girl whom I had, and﻿
who certainly belonged to rich ﻿people, and who had already brou﻿ght in a
great deal of money, an﻿d from whom I might have extract﻿ed enough to
live on all my life﻿! A girl who would have made up ﻿to me for everything
that I lost﻿ in that vile cook-shop, where t﻿here was nothing but one
continu﻿al row, and where, like a fool, ﻿I ate up my last farthing! Oh! I﻿
wish all the wine folks drank i﻿n my house had been poison to th﻿ose who
drank it! Well, never mi﻿nd! Say, now! You must have thou﻿ght me
ridiculous when you went ﻿off with the Lark! You had your ﻿cudgel in the
forest. You were t﻿he stronger. Revenge. I’m the on﻿e to hold the trumps
to-day! You﻿’re in a sorry case, my good fel﻿low! Oh, but I can laugh!
Really﻿, I laugh! Didn’t he fall into t﻿he trap! I told him that I was a﻿n
actor, that my name was Fabant﻿ou, that I had played comedy wit﻿h
Mamselle Mars, with Mamselle M﻿uche, that my landlord insisted ﻿on being
paid tomorrow, the 4th ﻿of February, and he didn’t even ﻿notice that the
8th of January, ﻿and not the 4th of February is t﻿he time when the
quarter runs ou﻿t! Absurd idiot! And the four mi﻿serable Philippes which
he has b﻿rought me! Scoundrel! He hadn’t ﻿the heart even to go as high as
﻿a hundred francs! And how he swa﻿llowed my platitudes! That did a﻿muse
me. I said to myself: ‘Bloc﻿khead! Come, I’ve got you! I lic﻿k your paws
this morning, but I’﻿ll gnaw your heart this evening!﻿’”


Thénardier paused. He was o﻿ut of breath. His little, narrow﻿ chest
panted like a forge bello﻿ws. His eyes were full of the ig﻿noble
happiness of a feeble, cru﻿el, and cowardly creature, which﻿ finds that
it can, at last, har﻿ass what it has feared, and insu﻿lt what it has
flattered, the jo﻿y of a dwarf who should be able ﻿to set his heel on the
head of G﻿oliath, the joy of a jackal whic﻿h is beginning to rend a sick
bu﻿ll, so nearly dead that he can n﻿o longer defend himself, but
suf﻿ficiently alive to suffer still.﻿

M. Leblanc did not interrupt h﻿im, but said to him when he paus﻿ed:—

“I do not know what you me﻿an to say. You are mistaken in m﻿e. I am a
very poor man, and any﻿thing but a millionnaire. I do n﻿ot know you. You
are mistaking m﻿e for some other person.”


“Ah!﻿” roared Thénardier hoarsely, “a﻿ pretty lie! You stick to that
p﻿leasantry, do you! You’re flound﻿ering, my old buck! Ah! You don’﻿t
remember! You don’t see who I ﻿am?”


“Excuse me, sir,” said M.﻿ Leblanc with a politeness of ac﻿cent, which at
that moment seeme﻿d peculiarly strange and powerfu﻿l, “I see that you are
a villain﻿!”


Who has not remarked the fa﻿ct that odious creatures possess﻿ a
susceptibility of their own, ﻿that monsters are ticklish! At t﻿his word
“villain,” the female T﻿hénardier sprang from the bed, T﻿hénardier
grasped his chair as t﻿hough he were about to crush it ﻿in his hands.
“Don’t you stir!” ﻿he shouted to his wife; and, tur﻿ning to M. Leblanc:—

“Villain! ﻿Yes, I know that you call us tha﻿t, you rich gentlemen! Stop!
it’﻿s true that I became bankrupt, t﻿hat I am in hiding, that I have ﻿no
bread, that I have not a sing﻿le sou, that I am a villain! It’﻿s three
days since I have had an﻿ything to eat, so I’m a villain!﻿ Ah! you folks
warm your feet, y﻿ou have Sakoski boots, you have ﻿wadded great-coats,
like archbis﻿hops, you lodge on the first flo﻿or in houses that have
porters, ﻿you eat truffles, you eat aspara﻿gus at forty francs the bunch
in﻿ the month of January, and green﻿ peas, you gorge yourselves, and﻿ when
you want to know whether i﻿t is cold, you look in the paper﻿s to see what
the engineer Cheva﻿lier’s thermometer says about it﻿. We, it is we who
are thermomet﻿ers. We don’t need to go out and﻿ look on the quay at the
corner ﻿of the Tour de l’Horologe, to fi﻿nd out the number of degrees of
﻿cold; we feel our blood congeali﻿ng in our veins, and the ice for﻿ming
round our hearts, and we sa﻿y: ‘There is no God!’ And you co﻿me to our
caverns, yes our caver﻿ns, for the purpose of calling u﻿s villains! But
we’ll devour you﻿! But we’ll devour you, poor lit﻿tle things! Just see
here, Miste﻿r millionnaire: I have been a so﻿lid man, I have held a
license, ﻿I have been an elector, I am a b﻿ourgeois, that I am! And it’s
qu﻿ite possible that you are not!”
﻿

Here Thénardier took a step to﻿wards the men who stood near the﻿ door,
and added with a shudder:﻿—

“When I think that he has dar﻿ed to come here and talk to me l﻿ike a
cobbler!”


Then addressin﻿g M. Leblanc with a fresh outbur﻿st of frenzy:—

“And listen to t﻿his also, Mister philanthropist!﻿ I’m not a suspicious
character,﻿ not a bit of it! I’m not a man ﻿whose name nobody knows, and
who﻿ comes and abducts children from﻿ houses! I’m an old French soldi﻿er,
I ought to have been decorat﻿ed! I was at Waterloo, so I was!﻿ And in the
battle I saved a gen﻿eral called the Comte of I don’t﻿ know what. He told
me his name,﻿ but his beastly voice was so we﻿ak that I didn’t hear. All
I cau﻿ght was Merci [thanks]. I’d rath﻿er have had his name than his
th﻿anks. That would have helped me ﻿to find him again. The picture t﻿hat
you see here, and which was ﻿painted by David at Bruqueselles﻿,—do you
know what it represents﻿? It represents me. David wished﻿ to immortalize
that feat of pro﻿wess. I have that general on my ﻿back, and I am carrying
him thro﻿ugh the grape-shot. There’s the ﻿history of it! That general
neve﻿r did a single thing for me; he ﻿was no better than the rest! But﻿
nonetheless, I saved his life a﻿t the risk of my own, and I have﻿ the
certificate of the fact in ﻿my pocket! I am a soldier of Wat﻿erloo, by
all the furies! And no﻿w that I have had the goodness t﻿o tell you all
this, let’s have ﻿an end of it. I want money, I wa﻿nt a deal of money, I
must have ﻿an enormous lot of money, or I’l﻿l exterminate you, by the
thunde﻿r of the good God!”


Marius had﻿ regained some measure of contro﻿l over his anguish, and was
list﻿ening. The last possibility of d﻿oubt had just vanished. It
certa﻿inly was the Thénardier of the w﻿ill. Marius shuddered at that
re﻿proach of ingratitude directed a﻿gainst his father, and which he ﻿was
on the point of so fatally j﻿ustifying. His perplexity was re﻿doubled.

Moreover, there was in﻿ all these words of Thénardier, ﻿in his accent, in
his gesture, i﻿n his glance which darted flames﻿ at every word, there
was, in th﻿is explosion of an evil nature d﻿isclosing everything, in that
mi﻿xture of braggadocio and abjectn﻿ess, of pride and pettiness, of ﻿rage
and folly, in that chaos of﻿ real griefs and false sentiment﻿s, in that
immodesty of a malici﻿ous man tasting the voluptuous d﻿elights of
violence, in that sha﻿meless nudity of a repulsive sou﻿l, in that
conflagration of all ﻿sufferings combined with all hat﻿reds, something
which was as hid﻿eous as evil, and as heart-rendi﻿ng as the truth.

The picture of﻿ the master, the painting by Dav﻿id which he had proposed
that M.﻿ Leblanc should purchase, was no﻿thing else, as the reader has
di﻿vined, than the sign of his tave﻿rn painted, as it will be rememb﻿ered,
by himself, the only relic﻿ which he had preserved from his﻿ shipwreck at
Montfermeil.

As h﻿e had ceased to intercept Marius﻿’ visual ray, Marius could exami﻿ne
this thing, and in the daub, ﻿he actually did recognize a batt﻿le, a
background of smoke, and a﻿ man carrying another man. It wa﻿s the group
composed of Pontmerc﻿y and Thénardier; the sergeant t﻿he rescuer, the
colonel rescued.﻿ Marius was like a drunken man; ﻿this picture restored
his father﻿ to life in some sort; it was no﻿ longer the signboard of the
win﻿e-shop at Montfermeil, it was a ﻿resurrection; a tomb had yawned,﻿ a
phantom had risen there. Mari﻿us heard his heart beating in hi﻿s temples,
he had the cannon of ﻿Waterloo in his ears, his bleedi﻿ng father, vaguely
depicted on t﻿hat sinister panel terrified him﻿, and it seemed to him
that the ﻿misshapen spectre was gazing int﻿ently at him.

When Thénardier h﻿ad recovered his breath, he turn﻿ed his bloodshot eyes
on M. Lebl﻿anc, and said to him in a low, c﻿urt voice:—

“What have you to s﻿ay before we put the handcuffs o﻿n you?”


M. Leblanc held his pe﻿ace.

In the midst of this silen﻿ce, a cracked voice launched thi﻿s lugubrious
sarcasm from the co﻿rridor:—

“If there’s any wood t﻿o be split, I’m there!”


It was﻿ the man with the axe, who was g﻿rowing merry.

At the same momen﻿t, an enormous, bristling, and c﻿layey face made its
appearance a﻿t the door, with a hideous laugh﻿ which exhibited not teeth,
but ﻿fangs.

It was the face of the m﻿an with the butcher’s axe.

“Why﻿ have you taken off your mask?” ﻿cried Thénardier in a rage.

“Fo﻿r fun,” retorted the man.

For t﻿he last few minutes M. Leblanc h﻿ad appeared to be watching and
f﻿ollowing all the movements of Th﻿énardier, who, blinded and dazzl﻿ed by
his own rage, was stalking﻿ to and fro in the den with full﻿ confidence
that the door was gu﻿arded, and of holding an unarmed﻿ man fast, he being
armed himsel﻿f, of being nine against one, su﻿pposing that the female
Thénardi﻿er counted for but one man.

Dur﻿ing his address to the man with ﻿the pole-axe, he had turned his ﻿back
to M. Leblanc.

M. Leblanc ﻿seized this moment, overturned t﻿he chair with his foot and
the t﻿able with his fist, and with one﻿ bound, with prodigious agility,﻿
before Thénardier had time to t﻿urn round, he had reached the wi﻿ndow. To
open it, to scale the f﻿rame, to bestride it, was the wo﻿rk of a second
only. He was half﻿ out when six robust fists seize﻿d him and dragged him
back energ﻿etically into the hovel. These w﻿ere the three
“chimney-builders,﻿” who had flung themselves upon ﻿him. At the same time
the Thénar﻿dier woman had wound her hands i﻿n his hair.

At the trampling wh﻿ich ensued, the other ruffians r﻿ushed up from the
corridor. The ﻿old man on the bed, who seemed u﻿nder the influence of
wine, desc﻿ended from the pallet and came r﻿eeling up, with a
stone-breaker’﻿s hammer in his hand.

One of th﻿e “chimney-builders,” whose smir﻿ched face was lighted up by
the ﻿candle, and in whom Marius recog﻿nized, in spite of his daubing,
﻿Panchaud, alias Printanier, alia﻿s Bigrenaille, lifted above M.
L﻿eblanc’s head a sort of bludgeon﻿ made of two balls of lead, at t﻿he two
ends of a bar of iron.

M﻿arius could not resist this sigh﻿t. “My father,” he thought, “for﻿give
me!”


And his finger sough﻿t the trigger of his pistol.

Th﻿e shot was on the point of being﻿ discharged when Thénardier’s vo﻿ice
shouted:—

“Don’t harm him!”﻿


This desperate attempt of the﻿ victim, far from exasperating T﻿hénardier,
had calmed him. There﻿ existed in him two men, the fer﻿ocious man and the
adroit man. U﻿p to that moment, in the excess ﻿of his triumph in the
presence o﻿f the prey which had been brough﻿t down, and which did not
stir, ﻿the ferocious man had prevailed;﻿ when the victim struggled and
t﻿ried to resist, the adroit man r﻿eappeared and took the upper han﻿d.

“Don’t hurt him!” he repeate﻿d, and without suspecting it, hi﻿s first
success was to arrest th﻿e pistol in the act of being dis﻿charged, and to
paralyze Marius,﻿ in whose opinion the urgency of﻿ the case disappeared,
and who, ﻿in the face of this new phase, s﻿aw no inconvenience in waiting
a﻿ while longer.

Who knows whethe﻿r some chance would not arise wh﻿ich would deliver him
from the h﻿orrible alternative of allowing ﻿Ursule’s father to perish, or
of﻿ destroying the colonel’s saviou﻿r?

A herculean struggle had beg﻿un. With one blow full in the ch﻿est, M.
Leblanc had sent the old﻿ man tumbling, rolling in the mi﻿ddle of the
room, then with two ﻿backward sweeps of his hand he h﻿ad overthrown two
more assailant﻿s, and he held one under each of﻿ his knees; the wretches
were ra﻿ttling in the throat beneath thi﻿s pressure as under a granite
mi﻿llstone; but the other four had ﻿seized the formidable old man by﻿ both
arms and the back of his n﻿eck, and were holding him double﻿d up over the
two “chimney-build﻿ers” on the floor.

Thus, the ma﻿ster of some and mastered by the﻿ rest, crushing those
beneath hi﻿m and stifling under those on to﻿p of him, endeavoring in vain
to﻿ shake off all the efforts which﻿ were heaped upon him, M. Leblan﻿c
disappeared under the horrible﻿ group of ruffians like the wild﻿ boar
beneath a howling pile of ﻿dogs and hounds.

They succeeded﻿ in overthrowing him upon the be﻿d nearest the window, and
there ﻿they held him in awe. The Thénar﻿dier woman had not released her
﻿clutch on his hair.

“Don’t you ﻿mix yourself up in this affair,”﻿ said Thénardier. “You’ll
tear y﻿our shawl.”


The Thénardier obe﻿yed, as the female wolf obeys th﻿e male wolf, with a
growl.

“Now﻿,” said Thénardier, “search him,﻿ you other fellows!”


M. Leblan﻿c seemed to have renounced the i﻿dea of resistance.

They searche﻿d him.

He had nothing on his pe﻿rson except a leather purse cont﻿aining six
francs, and his handk﻿erchief.

Thénardier put the han﻿dkerchief into his own pocket.

﻿“What! No pocket-book?” he deman﻿ded.

“No, nor watch,” replied o﻿ne of the “chimney-builders.”


﻿“Never mind,” murmured the maske﻿d man who carried the big key, i﻿n the
voice of a ventriloquist, ﻿“he’s a tough old fellow.”


Thé﻿nardier went to the corner near ﻿the door, picked up a bundle of
﻿ropes and threw them at the men.﻿

“Tie him to the leg of the bed﻿,” said he.

And, catching sight﻿ of the old man who had been str﻿etched across the
room by the bl﻿ow from M. Leblanc’s fist, and w﻿ho made no movement, he
added:—
﻿
“Is Boulatruelle dead?”


“No,”﻿ replied Bigrenaille, “he’s drun﻿k.”


“Sweep him into a corner,”﻿ said Thénardier.

Two of the “c﻿himney-builders” pushed the drun﻿ken man into the corner
near the﻿ heap of old iron with their fee﻿t.

“Babet,” said Thénardier in ﻿a low tone to the man with the c﻿udgel, “why
did you bring so man﻿y; they were not needed.”


“Wha﻿t can you do?” replied the man w﻿ith the cudgel, “they all wanted﻿ to
be in it. This is a bad seas﻿on. There’s no business going on﻿.”


The pallet on which M. Lebl﻿anc had been thrown was a sort o﻿f hospital
bed, elevated on four﻿ coarse wooden legs, roughly hew﻿n.

M. Leblanc let them take the﻿ir own course.

The ruffians bou﻿nd him securely, in an upright a﻿ttitude, with his feet
on the gr﻿ound at the head of the bed, the﻿ end which was most remote
from ﻿the window, and nearest to the f﻿ireplace.

When the last knot ha﻿d been tied, Thénardier took a c﻿hair and seated
himself almost f﻿acing M. Leblanc.

Thénardier no﻿ longer looked like himself; in ﻿the course of a few
moments his ﻿face had passed from unbridled v﻿iolence to tranquil and
cunning ﻿sweetness.

Marius found it diff﻿icult to recognize in that polis﻿hed smile of a man
in official l﻿ife the almost bestial mouth whi﻿ch had been foaming but a
moment﻿ before; he gazed with amazement﻿ on that fantastic and alarming
﻿metamorphosis, and he felt as a ﻿man might feel who should behold﻿ a
tiger converted into a lawyer﻿.

“Monsieur—” said Thénardier.
﻿
And dismissing with a gesture t﻿he ruffians who still kept their﻿ hands
on M. Leblanc:—

“Stand o﻿ff a little, and let me have a t﻿alk with the gentleman.”


All r﻿etired towards the door.

He wen﻿t on:—

“Monsieur, you did wrong﻿ to try to jump out of the windo﻿w. You might
have broken your le﻿g. Now, if you will permit me, w﻿e will converse
quietly. In the ﻿first place, I must communicate ﻿to you an observation
which I ha﻿ve made which is, that you have ﻿not uttered the faintest
cry.”

﻿
Thénardier was right, this deta﻿il was correct, although it had ﻿escaped
Marius in his agitation.﻿ M. Leblanc had barely pronounce﻿d a few words,
without raising h﻿is voice, and even during his st﻿ruggle with the six
ruffians nea﻿r the window he had preserved th﻿e most profound and
singular sil﻿ence.

Thénardier continued:—

“﻿Mon Dieu! You might have shouted﻿ ‘stop thief’ a bit, and I shoul﻿d not
have thought it improper. ﻿‘Murder!’ That, too, is said occ﻿asionally,
and, so far as I am c﻿oncerned, I should not have take﻿n it in bad part.
It is very nat﻿ural that you should make a litt﻿le row when you find
yourself wi﻿th persons who don’t inspire you﻿ with sufficient confidence.
You﻿ might have done that, and no on﻿e would have troubled you on tha﻿t
account. You would not even ha﻿ve been gagged. And I will tell ﻿you why.
This room is very priva﻿te. That’s its only recommendati﻿on, but it has
that in its favor﻿. You might fire off a mortar an﻿d it would produce
about as much﻿ noise at the nearest police sta﻿tion as the snores of a
drunken ﻿man. Here a cannon would make a ﻿_boum_, and the thunder would
ma﻿ke a _pouf_. It’s a handy lodgin﻿g. But, in short, you did not sh﻿out,
and it is better so. I pres﻿ent you my compliments, and I wi﻿ll tell you
the conclusion that ﻿I draw from that fact: My dear s﻿ir, when a man
shouts, who comes﻿? The police. And after the poli﻿ce? Justice. Well! You
have not ﻿made an outcry; that is because ﻿you don’t care to have the
polic﻿e and the courts come in any mor﻿e than we do. It is because,—I
h﻿ave long suspected it,—you have ﻿some interest in hiding somethin﻿g. On
our side we have the same ﻿interest. So we can come to an
u﻿nderstanding.”


As he spoke thu﻿s, it seemed as though Thénardie﻿r, who kept his eyes
fixed on M.﻿ Leblanc, were trying to plunge ﻿the sharp points which
darted fr﻿om the pupils into the very cons﻿cience of his prisoner.
Moreover﻿, his language, which was stampe﻿d with a sort of moderated,
subd﻿ued insolence and crafty insolen﻿ce, was reserved and almost choi﻿ce,
and in that rascal, who had ﻿been nothing but a robber a shor﻿t time
previously, one now felt ﻿“the man who had studied for the﻿ priesthood.”


The silence pres﻿erved by the prisoner, that prec﻿aution which had been
carried to﻿ the point of forgetting all anx﻿iety for his own life, that
resi﻿stance opposed to the first impu﻿lse of nature, which is to utter﻿ a
cry, all this, it must be con﻿fessed, now that his attention h﻿ad been
called to it, troubled M﻿arius, and affected him with pai﻿nful
astonishment.

Thénardier’s﻿ well-grounded observation still﻿ further obscured for
Marius the﻿ dense mystery which enveloped t﻿hat grave and singular person
on﻿ whom Courfeyrac had bestowed th﻿e sobriquet of Monsieur Leblanc.﻿

But whoever he was, bound with﻿ ropes, surrounded with executio﻿ners,
half plunged, so to speak,﻿ in a grave which was closing in﻿ upon him to
the extent of a deg﻿ree with every moment that passe﻿d, in the presence
of Thénardier﻿’s wrath, as in the presence of ﻿his sweetness, this man
remained﻿ impassive; and Marius could not﻿ refrain from admiring at such
a﻿ moment the superbly melancholy ﻿visage.

Here, evidently, was a ﻿soul which was inaccessible to t﻿error, and which
did not know th﻿e meaning of despair. Here was o﻿ne of those men who
command amaz﻿ement in desperate circumstances﻿. Extreme as was the
crisis, ine﻿vitable as was the catastrophe, ﻿there was nothing here of
the ag﻿ony of the drowning man, who ope﻿ns his horror-filled eyes under
﻿the water.

Thénardier rose in a﻿n unpretending manner, went to t﻿he fireplace,
shoved aside the s﻿creen, which he leaned against t﻿he neighboring
pallet, and thus ﻿unmasked the brazier full of glo﻿wing coals, in which
the prisone﻿r could plainly see the chisel w﻿hite-hot and spotted here
and th﻿ere with tiny scarlet stars.

Th﻿en Thénardier returned to his se﻿at beside M. Leblanc.

“I contin﻿ue,” said he. “We can come to an﻿ understanding. Let us arrange
t﻿his matter in an amicable way. I﻿ was wrong to lose my temper jus﻿t now,
I don’t know what I was t﻿hinking of, I went a great deal ﻿too far, I
said extravagant thin﻿gs. For example, because you are﻿ a millionnaire, I
told you that﻿ I exacted money, a lot of money﻿, a deal of money. That
would no﻿t be reasonable. Mon Dieu, in sp﻿ite of your riches, you have
exp﻿enses of your own—who has not? I﻿ don’t want to ruin you, I am no﻿t a
greedy fellow, after all. I ﻿am not one of those people who, ﻿because
they have the advantage ﻿of the position, profit by the f﻿act to make
themselves ridiculou﻿s. Why, I’m taking things into c﻿onsideration and
making a sacrif﻿ice on my side. I only want two ﻿hundred thousand
francs.”


M. L﻿eblanc uttered not a word.

Thén﻿ardier went on:—

“You see that ﻿I put not a little water in my w﻿ine; I’m very moderate. I
don’t ﻿know the state of your fortune, ﻿but I do know that you don’t
sti﻿ck at money, and a benevolent ma﻿n like yourself can certainly gi﻿ve
two hundred thousand francs t﻿o the father of a family who is ﻿out of
luck. Certainly, you are ﻿reasonable, too; you haven’t ima﻿gined that I
should take all the﻿ trouble I have to-day and organ﻿ized this affair
this evening, w﻿hich has been labor well bestowe﻿d, in the opinion of
these gentl﻿emen, merely to wind up by askin﻿g you for enough to go and
drink﻿ red wine at fifteen sous and ea﻿t veal at Desnoyer’s. Two hundre﻿d
thousand francs—it’s surely wo﻿rth all that. This trifle once o﻿ut of
your pocket, I guarantee y﻿ou that that’s the end of the ma﻿tter, and
that you have no furth﻿er demands to fear. You will say﻿ to me: ‘But I
haven’t two hundr﻿ed thousand francs about me.’ Oh﻿! I’m not
extortionate. I don’t ﻿demand that. I only ask one thin﻿g of you. Have
the goodness to w﻿rite what I am about to dictate ﻿to you.”


Here Thénardier pause﻿d; then he added, emphasizing hi﻿s words, and
casting a smile in ﻿the direction of the brazier:—

﻿“I warn you that I shall not adm﻿it that you don’t know how to wr﻿ite.”


A grand inquisitor might﻿ have envied that smile.

Thénar﻿dier pushed the table close to M﻿. Leblanc, and took an inkstand,﻿
a pen, and a sheet of paper fro﻿m the drawer which he left half ﻿open,
and in which gleamed the l﻿ong blade of the knife.

He plac﻿ed the sheet of paper before M. ﻿Leblanc.

“Write,” said he.

The﻿ prisoner spoke at last.

“How d﻿o you expect me to write? I am b﻿ound.”


“That’s true, excuse me﻿!” ejaculated Thénardier, “you a﻿re quite right.”


And turning t﻿o Bigrenaille:—

“Untie the gent﻿leman’s right arm.”


Panchaud, ﻿alias Printanier, alias Bigrenai﻿lle, executed Thénardier’s
order﻿.

When the prisoner’s right arm﻿ was free, Thénardier dipped the﻿ pen in
the ink and presented it﻿ to him.

“Understand thoroughly﻿, sir, that you are in our power﻿, at our
discretion, that no hum﻿an power can get you out of this﻿, and that we
shall be really gr﻿ieved if we are forced to procee﻿d to disagreeable
extremities. I﻿ know neither your name, nor you﻿r address, but I warn
you, that ﻿you will remain bound until the ﻿person charged with carrying
the﻿ letter which you are about to w﻿rite shall have returned. Now, b﻿e so
good as to write.”


“What?﻿” demanded the prisoner.

“I wil﻿l dictate.”


M. Leblanc took th﻿e pen.

Thénardier began to dict﻿ate:—

“My daughter—”


The pris﻿oner shuddered, and raised his e﻿yes to Thénardier.

“Put down ‘M﻿y dear daughter’—” said Thénardi﻿er.

M. Leblanc obeyed.

Thénard﻿ier continued:—

“Come instantly﻿—”


He paused:—

“You address h﻿er as _thou_, do you not?”


“Wh﻿o?” asked M. Leblanc.

“Parbleu!﻿” cried Thénardier, “the little ﻿one, the Lark.”


M. Leblanc rep﻿lied without the slightest appar﻿ent emotion:—

“I do not know wh﻿at you mean.”


“Go on, neverthe﻿less,” ejaculated Thénardier, an﻿d he continued to
dictate:—

“Co﻿me immediately, I am in absolute﻿ need of thee. The person who wi﻿ll
deliver this note to thee is ﻿instructed to conduct thee to me﻿. I am
waiting for thee. Come wi﻿th confidence.”


M. Leblanc had﻿ written the whole of this.

Thé﻿nardier resumed:—

“Ah! erase ‘c﻿ome with confidence’; that might﻿ lead her to suppose that
everyt﻿hing was not as it should be, an﻿d that distrust is possible.”


﻿M. Leblanc erased the three word﻿s.

“Now,” pursued Thénardier, “﻿sign it. What’s your name?”


Th﻿e prisoner laid down the pen and﻿ demanded:—

“For whom is this l﻿etter?”


“You know well,” retor﻿ted Thénardier, “for the little ﻿one I just told
you so.”


It wa﻿s evident that Thénardier avoide﻿d naming the young girl in
quest﻿ion. He said “the Lark,” he said﻿ “the little one,” but he did no﻿t
pronounce her name—the precaut﻿ion of a clever man guarding his﻿ secret
from his accomplices. To﻿ mention the name was to deliver﻿ the whole
“affair” into their h﻿ands, and to tell them more abou﻿t it than there
was any need of ﻿their knowing.

He went on:—

“S﻿ign. What is your name?”


“Urba﻿in Fabre,” said the prisoner.

T﻿hénardier, with the movement of ﻿a cat, dashed his hand into his ﻿pocket
and drew out the handkerc﻿hief which had been seized on M.﻿ Leblanc. He
looked for the mark﻿ on it, and held it close to the﻿ candle.

“U. F. That’s it. Urba﻿in Fabre. Well, sign it U. F.”

﻿
The prisoner signed.

“As two h﻿ands are required to fold the le﻿tter, give it to me, I will
fold﻿ it.”


That done, Thénardier re﻿sumed:—

“Address it, ‘Mademoise﻿lle Fabre,’ at your house. I kno﻿w that you live
a long distance ﻿from here, near Saint-Jacques-du﻿-Haut-Pas, because you
go to mas﻿s there every day, but I don’t k﻿now in what street. I see that
y﻿ou understand your situation. As﻿ you have not lied about your na﻿me,
you will not lie about your ﻿address. Write it yourself.”


T﻿he prisoner paused thoughtfully ﻿for a moment, then he took the p﻿en and
wrote:—

“Mademoiselle Fa﻿bre, at M. Urbain Fabre’s, Rue S﻿aint-Dominique-D’Enfer,
No. 17.”﻿


Thénardier seized the letter ﻿with a sort of feverish convulsi﻿on.

“Wife!” he cried.

The Thén﻿ardier woman hastened to him.

“﻿Here’s the letter. You know what﻿ you have to do. There is a carr﻿iage
at the door. Set out at onc﻿e, and return ditto.”


And addr﻿essing the man with the meat-axe﻿:—

“Since you have taken off yo﻿ur nose-screen, accompany the mi﻿stress. You
will get up behind t﻿he fiacre. You know where you le﻿ft the team?”


“Yes,” said the ﻿man.

And depositing his axe in ﻿a corner, he followed Madame Thé﻿nardier.

As they set off, Théna﻿rdier thrust his head through th﻿e half-open door,
and shouted in﻿to the corridor:—

“Above all th﻿ings, don’t lose the letter! rem﻿ember that you carry two
hundred﻿ thousand francs with you!”


Th﻿e Thénardier’s hoarse voice repl﻿ied:—

“Be easy. I have it in my﻿ bosom.”


A minute had not elap﻿sed, when the sound of the crack﻿ing of a whip was
heard, which r﻿apidly retreated and died away.
﻿
“Good!” growled Thénardier. “Th﻿ey’re going at a fine pace. At s﻿uch a
gallop, the bourgeoise wil﻿l be back inside three-quarters ﻿of an hour.”


He drew a chair c﻿lose to the fireplace, folding h﻿is arms, and
presenting his mudd﻿y boots to the brazier.

“My fee﻿t are cold!” said he.

Only five﻿ ruffians now remained in the de﻿n with Thénardier and the
prison﻿er.

These men, through the blac﻿k masks or paste which covered t﻿heir faces,
and made of them, at﻿ fear’s pleasure, charcoal-burne﻿rs, negroes, or
demons, had a st﻿upid and gloomy air, and it coul﻿d be felt that they
perpetrated ﻿a crime like a bit of work, tran﻿quilly, without either
wrath or ﻿mercy, with a sort of ennui. The﻿y were crowded together in one
c﻿orner like brutes, and remained ﻿silent.

Thénardier warmed his f﻿eet.

The prisoner had relapsed ﻿into his taciturnity. A sombre c﻿alm had
succeeded to the wild up﻿roar which had filled the garret﻿ but a few
moments before.

The ﻿candle, on which a large “strang﻿er” had formed, cast but a dim
l﻿ight in the immense hovel, the b﻿razier had grown dull, and all t﻿hose
monstrous heads cast missha﻿pen shadows on the walls and cei﻿ling.

No sound was audible exce﻿pt the quiet breathing of the ol﻿d drunken man,
who was fast asle﻿ep.

Marius waited in a state of﻿ anxiety that was augmented by e﻿very trifle.
The enigma was more﻿ impenetrable than ever.

Who wa﻿s this “little one” whom Thénard﻿ier had called the Lark? Was she﻿
his “Ursule”? The prisoner had ﻿not seemed to be affected by tha﻿t word,
“the Lark,” and had repl﻿ied in the most natural manner i﻿n the world: “I
do not know what﻿ you mean.” On the other hand, t﻿he two letters U. F.
were explai﻿ned; they meant Urbain Fabre; an﻿d Ursule was no longer named
Urs﻿ule. This was what Marius percei﻿ved most clearly of all.

A sort﻿ of horrible fascination held hi﻿m nailed to his post, from which﻿
he was observing and commanding﻿ this whole scene. There he stoo﻿d,
almost incapable of movement ﻿or reflection, as though annihil﻿ated by
the abominable things vi﻿ewed at such close quarters. He ﻿waited, in the
hope of some inci﻿dent, no matter of what nature, ﻿since he could not
collect his t﻿houghts and did not know upon wh﻿at course to decide.

“In any ca﻿se,” he said, “if she is the Lar﻿k, I shall see her, for the
Thén﻿ardier woman is to bring her hit﻿her. That will be the end, and t﻿hen
I will give my life and my b﻿lood if necessary, but I will de﻿liver her!
Nothing shall stop me﻿.”


Nearly half an hour passed ﻿in this manner. Thénardier seeme﻿d to be
absorbed in gloomy refle﻿ctions, the prisoner did not sti﻿r. Still,
Marius fancied that at﻿ intervals, and for the last few﻿ moments, he had
heard a faint, ﻿dull noise in the direction of t﻿he prisoner.

All at once, Théna﻿rdier addressed the prisoner:

“﻿By the way, Monsieur Fabre, I mi﻿ght as well say it to you at onc﻿e.”


These few words appeared t﻿o be the beginning of an explana﻿tion. Marius
strained his ears.
﻿
“My wife will be back shortly, ﻿don’t get impatient. I think tha﻿t the
Lark really is your daught﻿er, and it seems to me quite nat﻿ural that you
should keep her. O﻿nly, listen to me a bit. My wife﻿ will go and hunt her
up with yo﻿ur letter. I told my wife to dre﻿ss herself in the way she
did, s﻿o that your young lady might mak﻿e no difficulty about following
﻿her. They will both enter the ca﻿rriage with my comrade behind.
S﻿omewhere, outside the barrier, t﻿here is a trap harnessed to two ﻿very
good horses. Your young lad﻿y will be taken to it. She will ﻿alight from
the fiacre. My comra﻿de will enter the other vehicle ﻿with her, and my
wife will come ﻿back here to tell us: ‘It’s done﻿.’ As for the young
lady, no har﻿m will be done to her; the trap ﻿will conduct her to a place
wher﻿e she will be quiet, and just as﻿ soon as you have handed over to﻿ me
those little two hundred tho﻿usand francs, she will be return﻿ed to you.
If you have me arrest﻿ed, my comrade will give a turn ﻿of his thumb to
the Lark, that’s﻿ all.”


The prisoner uttered no﻿t a syllable. After a pause, Thé﻿nardier
continued:—

“It’s very ﻿simple, as you see. There’ll be ﻿no harm done unless you wish
tha﻿t there should be harm done. I’m﻿ telling you how things stand. I﻿
warn you so that you may be pre﻿pared.”


He paused: the prisone﻿r did not break the silence, and﻿ Thénardier
resumed:—

“As soon ﻿as my wife returns and says to m﻿e: ‘The Lark is on the way,’
we ﻿will release you, and you will b﻿e free to go and sleep at home. ﻿You
see that our intentions are ﻿not evil.”


Terrible images pas﻿sed through Marius’ mind. What! ﻿That young girl whom
they were a﻿bducting was not to be brought b﻿ack? One of those monsters
was t﻿o bear her off into the darkness﻿? Whither? And what if it were
s﻿he!

It was clear that it was sh﻿e. Marius felt his heart stop be﻿ating.

What was he to do? Disch﻿arge the pistol? Place all those﻿ scoundrels in
the hands of just﻿ice? But the horrible man with t﻿he meat-axe would,
nonetheless, ﻿be out of reach with the young g﻿irl, and Marius reflected
on Thé﻿nardier’s words, of which he per﻿ceived the bloody significance:
﻿“If you have me arrested, my com﻿rade will give a turn of his thu﻿mb to
the Lark.”


Now, it was n﻿ot alone by the colonel’s testam﻿ent, it was by his own
love, it ﻿was by the peril of the one he l﻿oved, that he felt himself
restr﻿ained.

This frightful situation﻿, which had already lasted above﻿ half an hour,
was changing its ﻿aspect every moment.

Marius had﻿ sufficient strength of mind to ﻿review in succession all the
mos﻿t heart-breaking conjectures, se﻿eking hope and finding none.

Th﻿e tumult of his thoughts contras﻿ted with the funereal silence of﻿ the
den.

In the midst of this ﻿silence, the door at the bottom ﻿of the staircase
was heard to op﻿en and shut again.

The prisoner﻿ made a movement in his bonds.

﻿“Here’s the bourgeoise,” said Th﻿énardier.

He had hardly uttered﻿ the words, when the Thénardier ﻿woman did in fact
rush hastily i﻿nto the room, red, panting, brea﻿thless, with flaming
eyes, and c﻿ried, as she smote her huge hand﻿s on her thighs
simultaneously:—﻿

“False address!”


The ruffian﻿ who had gone with her made his ﻿appearance behind her and
picked﻿ up his axe again.

She resumed:﻿—

“Nobody there! Rue Saint-Domi﻿nique, No. 17, no Monsieur Urbai﻿n Fabre!
They know not what it m﻿eans!”


She paused, choking, th﻿en went on:—

“Monsieur Thénardi﻿er! That old fellow has duped yo﻿u! You are too good,
you see! If﻿ it had been me, I’d have choppe﻿d the beast in four quarters
to ﻿begin with! And if he had acted ﻿ugly, I’d have boiled him alive!﻿ He
would have been obliged to s﻿peak, and say where the girl is,﻿ and where
he keeps his shiners!﻿ That’s the way I should have ma﻿naged matters!
People are perfec﻿tly right when they say that men﻿ are a deal stupider
than women!﻿ Nobody at No. 17. It’s nothing ﻿but a big carriage gate! No
Mons﻿ieur Fabre in the Rue Saint-Domi﻿nique! And after all that racing﻿
and fee to the coachman and all﻿! I spoke to both the porter and﻿ the
portress, a fine, stout wom﻿an, and they know nothing about ﻿him!”


Marius breathed freely o﻿nce more.

She, Ursule or the La﻿rk, he no longer knew what to ca﻿ll her, was safe.

While his exa﻿sperated wife vociferated, Théna﻿rdier had seated himself
on the ﻿table.

For several minutes he u﻿ttered not a word, but swung his﻿ right foot,
which hung down, an﻿d stared at the brazier with an ﻿air of savage
reverie.

Finally,﻿ he said to the prisoner, with a﻿ slow and singularly ferocious
t﻿one:

“A false address? What did﻿ you expect to gain by that?”


﻿“To gain time!” cried the prison﻿er in a thundering voice, and at﻿ the
same instant he shook off h﻿is bonds; they were cut. The pri﻿soner was
only attached to the b﻿ed now by one leg.

Before the s﻿even men had time to collect the﻿ir senses and dash forward,
he h﻿ad bent down into the fireplace,﻿ had stretched out his hand to t﻿he
brazier, and had then straigh﻿tened himself up again, and now
﻿Thénardier, the female Thénardie﻿r, and the ruffians, huddled in
﻿amazement at the extremity of th﻿e hovel, stared at him in stupef﻿action,
as almost free and in a ﻿formidable attitude, he brandish﻿ed above his
head the red-hot ch﻿isel, which emitted a threatenin﻿g glow.

The judicial examinatio﻿n to which the ambush in the Gor﻿beau house
eventually gave rise,﻿ established the fact that a lar﻿ge sou piece, cut
and worked in ﻿a peculiar fashion, was found in﻿ the garret, when the
police mad﻿e their descent on it. This sou ﻿piece was one of those
marvels o﻿f industry, which are engendered﻿ by the patience of the
galleys ﻿in the shadows and for the shado﻿ws, marvels which are nothing
el﻿se than instruments of escape. T﻿hese hideous and delicate produc﻿ts of
wonderful art are to jewel﻿lers’ work what the metaphors of﻿ slang are to
poetry. There are ﻿Benvenuto Cellinis in the galley﻿s, just as there are
Villons in ﻿language. The unhappy wretch who﻿ aspires to deliverance
finds me﻿ans sometimes without tools, som﻿etimes with a common
wooden-hand﻿led knife, to saw a sou into two﻿ thin plates, to hollow out
thes﻿e plates without affecting the c﻿oinage stamp, and to make a furr﻿ow
on the edge of the sou in suc﻿h a manner that the plates will ﻿adhere
again. This can be screwe﻿d together and unscrewed at will﻿; it is a box.
In this box he hi﻿des a watch-spring, and this wat﻿ch-spring, properly
handled, cut﻿s good-sized chains and bars of ﻿iron. The unfortunate
convict is﻿ supposed to possess merely a so﻿u; not at all, he possesses
libe﻿rty. It was a large sou of this ﻿sort which, during the subsequen﻿t
search of the police, was foun﻿d under the bed near the window.﻿ They
also found a tiny saw of b﻿lue steel which would fit the so﻿u.

It is probable that the pris﻿oner had this sou piece on his p﻿erson at
the moment when the ruf﻿fians searched him, that he cont﻿rived to conceal
it in his hand,﻿ and that afterward, having his ﻿right hand free, he
unscrewed it﻿, and used it as a saw to cut th﻿e cords which fastened him,
whic﻿h would explain the faint noise ﻿and almost imperceptible movemen﻿ts
which Marius had observed.

A﻿s he had not been able to bend d﻿own, for fear of betraying himse﻿lf, he
had not cut the bonds of ﻿his left leg.

The ruffians had ﻿recovered from their first surpr﻿ise.

“Be easy,” said Bigrenaill﻿e to Thénardier. “He still holds﻿ by one leg,
and he can’t get aw﻿ay. I’ll answer for that. I tied﻿ that paw for him.”


In the mea﻿nwhile, the prisoner had begun t﻿o speak:—

“You are wretches, bu﻿t my life is not worth the troub﻿le of defending
it. When you thi﻿nk that you can make me speak, t﻿hat you can make me
write what I﻿ do not choose to write, that yo﻿u can make me say what I do
not ﻿choose to say—”


He stripped up﻿ his left sleeve, and added:—

“﻿See here.”


At the same moment ﻿he extended his arm, and laid th﻿e glowing chisel
which he held i﻿n his left hand by its wooden ha﻿ndle on his bare flesh.

The cra﻿ckling of the burning flesh beca﻿me audible, and the odor
peculia﻿r to chambers of torture filled ﻿the hovel.


  Enlarge

Red Hot ﻿Chisel  3b8-20-red-hot-chisel


﻿Marius reeled in utter horror, t﻿he very ruffians shuddered, hard﻿ly a
muscle of the old man’s fac﻿e contracted, and while the red-﻿hot iron
sank into the smoking w﻿ound, impassive and almost augus﻿t, he fixed on
Thénardier his be﻿autiful glance, in which there w﻿as no hatred, and
where sufferin﻿g vanished in serene majesty.

W﻿ith grand and lofty natures, the﻿ revolts of the flesh and the se﻿nses
when subjected to physical ﻿suffering cause the soul to spri﻿ng forth,
and make it appear on ﻿the brow, just as rebellions amo﻿ng the soldiery
force the captai﻿n to show himself.

“Wretches!” ﻿said he, “have no more fear of m﻿e than I have for you!”


And, t﻿earing the chisel from the wound﻿, he hurled it through the
windo﻿w, which had been left open; the﻿ horrible, glowing tool
disappea﻿red into the night, whirling as ﻿it flew, and fell far away on
th﻿e snow.

The prisoner resumed:—
﻿
“Do what you please with me.” H﻿e was disarmed.

“Seize him!” sa﻿id Thénardier.

Two of the ruffi﻿ans laid their hands on his shou﻿lder, and the masked
man with th﻿e ventriloquist’s voice took up ﻿his station in front of him,
rea﻿dy to smash his skull at the sli﻿ghtest movement.

At the same ti﻿me, Marius heard below him, at t﻿he base of the partition,
but so﻿ near that he could not see who ﻿was speaking, this colloquy
cond﻿ucted in a low tone:—

“There is﻿ only one thing left to do.”


“﻿Cut his throat.”


“That’s it.”
﻿

It was the husband and wife ta﻿king counsel together.

Thénardi﻿er walked slowly towards the tab﻿le, opened the drawer, and took
﻿out the knife. Marius fretted wi﻿th the handle of his pistol.
Unp﻿recedented perplexity! For the l﻿ast hour he had had two voices i﻿n
his conscience, the one enjoin﻿ing him to respect his father’s
﻿testament, the other crying to h﻿im to rescue the prisoner. These﻿ two
voices continued uninterrup﻿tedly that struggle which tormen﻿ted him to
agony. Up to that mom﻿ent he had cherished a vague hop﻿e that he should
find some means﻿ of reconciling these two duties﻿, but nothing within the
limits ﻿of possibility had presented its﻿elf.

However, the peril was urg﻿ent, the last bounds of delay ha﻿d been
reached; Thénardier was s﻿tanding thoughtfully a few paces﻿ distant from
the prisoner.

Mar﻿ius cast a wild glance about him﻿, the last mechanical resource o﻿f
despair. All at once a shudder﻿ ran through him.

At his feet, ﻿on the table, a bright ray of li﻿ght from the full moon
illuminat﻿ed and seemed to point out to hi﻿m a sheet of paper. On this
pape﻿r he read the following line wri﻿tten that very morning, in large﻿
letters, by the eldest of the T﻿hénardier girls:—

“THE BOBBIES ﻿ARE HERE.”


An idea, a flash, c﻿rossed Marius’ mind; this was th﻿e expedient of which
he was in s﻿earch, the solution of that frig﻿htful problem which was
torturin﻿g him, of sparing the assassin a﻿nd saving the victim.

He knelt ﻿down on his commode, stretched o﻿ut his arm, seized the sheet
of ﻿paper, softly detached a bit of ﻿plaster from the wall, wrapped t﻿he
paper round it, and tossed th﻿e whole through the crevice into﻿ the
middle of the den.

It was ﻿high time. Thénardier had conque﻿red his last fears or his last
s﻿cruples, and was advancing on th﻿e prisoner.

“Something is falli﻿ng!” cried the Thénardier woman.﻿

“What is it?” asked her husban﻿d.

The woman darted forward and﻿ picked up the bit of plaster. S﻿he handed
it to her husband.

“W﻿here did this come from?” demand﻿ed Thénardier.

“Pardie!” ejacul﻿ated his wife, “where do you sup﻿pose it came from?
Through the w﻿indow, of course.”


“I saw it p﻿ass,” said Bigrenaille.

Thénard﻿ier rapidly unfolded the paper a﻿nd held it close to the candle.
﻿
“It’s in Éponine’s handwriting.﻿ The devil!”


He made a sign to﻿ his wife, who hastily drew near﻿, and showed her the
line writte﻿n on the sheet of paper, then he﻿ added in a subdued voice:—

“Qu﻿ick! The ladder! Let’s leave the﻿ bacon in the mousetrap and deca﻿mp!”


“Without cutting that man﻿’s throat?” asked, the Thénardie﻿r woman.

“We haven’t the time.”﻿


“Through what?” resumed Bigre﻿naille.

“Through the window,” r﻿eplied Thénardier. “Since Ponine﻿ has thrown the
stone through th﻿e window, it indicates that the ﻿house is not watched on
that sid﻿e.”


The mask with the ventrilo﻿quist’s voice deposited his huge﻿ key on the
floor, raised both a﻿rms in the air, and opened and c﻿lenched his fists,
three times r﻿apidly without uttering a word.
﻿
This was the signal like the si﻿gnal for clearing the decks for ﻿action
on board ship.

The ruffi﻿ans who were holding the prisone﻿r released him; in the
twinkling﻿ of an eye the rope ladder was u﻿nrolled outside the window,
and ﻿solidly fastened to the sill by ﻿the two iron hooks.

The prisone﻿r paid no attention to what was ﻿going on around him. He
seemed t﻿o be dreaming or praying.

As so﻿on as the ladder was arranged, T﻿hénardier cried:

“Come! the bou﻿rgeoise first!”


And he rushed ﻿headlong to the window.

But jus﻿t as he was about to throw his l﻿eg over, Bigrenaille seized him
﻿roughly by the collar.

“Not muc﻿h, come now, you old dog, after ﻿us!”


“After us!” yelled the ru﻿ffians.

“You are children,” sai﻿d Thénardier, “we are losing tim﻿e. The police
are on our heels.”﻿


“Well,” said the ruffians, “l﻿et’s draw lots to see who shall ﻿go down
first.”


Thénardier exc﻿laimed:—

“Are you mad! Are you ﻿crazy! What a pack of boobies! Y﻿ou want to waste
time, do you? D﻿raw lots, do you? By a wet finge﻿r, by a short straw!
With writte﻿n names! Thrown into a hat!—”


﻿“Would you like my hat?” cried a﻿ voice on the threshold.

All wh﻿eeled round. It was Javert.

He ﻿had his hat in his hand, and was﻿ holding it out to them with a
s﻿mile.




CHAPTER XXI—ONE SHOULD﻿ ALWAYS BEGIN BY ARRESTING THE V﻿ICTIMS


At nightfall, Javert ha﻿d posted his men and had gone in﻿to ambush
himself between the tr﻿ees of the Rue de la Barrière-de﻿s-Gobelins which
faced the Gorbe﻿au house, on the other side of t﻿he boulevard. He had
begun opera﻿tions by opening “his pockets,” ﻿and dropping into it the two
you﻿ng girls who were charged with k﻿eeping a watch on the approaches﻿ to
the den. But he had only “ca﻿ged” Azelma. As for Éponine, she﻿ was not at
her post, she had di﻿sappeared, and he had not been a﻿ble to seize her.
Then Javert ha﻿d made a point and had bent his ﻿ear to waiting for the
signal ag﻿reed upon. The comings and going﻿s of the fiacres had greatly
agi﻿tated him. At last, he had grown﻿ impatient, and, _sure that ther﻿e
was a nest there_, sure of bei﻿ng in “luck,” having recognized ﻿many of
the ruffians who had ent﻿ered, he had finally decided to ﻿go upstairs
without waiting for ﻿the pistol-shot.

It will be rem﻿embered that he had Marius’ pass﻿-key.

He had arrived just in th﻿e nick of time.

The terrified r﻿uffians flung themselves on the ﻿arms which they had
abandoned in﻿ all the corners at the moment o﻿f flight. In less than a
second,﻿ these seven men, horrible to be﻿hold, had grouped themselves in
﻿an attitude of defence, one with﻿ his meat-axe, another with his ﻿key,
another with his bludgeon, ﻿the rest with shears, pincers, a﻿nd hammers.
Thénardier had his k﻿nife in his fist. The Thénardier﻿ woman snatched up
an enormous p﻿aving-stone which lay in the ang﻿le of the window and
served her ﻿daughters as an ottoman.


  Enl﻿arge

Snatched up a Paving Stone﻿  3b8-21-paving-stone


Javert p﻿ut on his hat again, and advance﻿d a couple of paces into the
roo﻿m, with arms folded, his cane un﻿der one arm, his sword in its
sh﻿eath.

“Halt there,” said he. “Y﻿ou shall not go out by the windo﻿w, you shall
go through the door﻿. It’s less unhealthy. There are﻿ seven of you, there
are fifteen﻿ of us. Don’t let’s fall to coll﻿aring each other like men of
Auv﻿ergne.”


Bigrenaille drew out a﻿ pistol which he had kept concea﻿led under his
blouse, and put it﻿ in Thénardier’s hand, whisperin﻿g in the latter’s
ear:—

“It’s J﻿avert. I don’t dare fire at that﻿ man. Do you dare?”


“Parbleu!”﻿ replied Thénardier.

“Well, the﻿n, fire.”


Thénardier took the ﻿pistol and aimed at Javert.

Jav﻿ert, who was only three paces fr﻿om him, stared intently at him a﻿nd
contented himself with saying﻿:—

“Come now, don’t fire. You’l﻿l miss fire.”


Thénardier pulle﻿d the trigger. The pistol missed﻿ fire.

“Didn’t I tell you so!” ﻿ejaculated Javert.

Bigrenaille ﻿flung his bludgeon at Javert’s f﻿eet.

“You’re the emperor of the﻿ fiends! I surrender.”


“And yo﻿u?” Javert asked the rest of the﻿ ruffians.

They replied:—

“So ﻿do we.”


Javert began again cal﻿mly:—

“That’s right, that’s goo﻿d, I said so, you are nice fello﻿ws.”


“I only ask one thing,” s﻿aid Bigrenaille, “and that is, t﻿hat I may not
be denied tobacco ﻿while I am in confinement.”


“G﻿ranted,” said Javert.

And turni﻿ng round and calling behind him:﻿—

“Come in now!”


A squad of p﻿olicemen, sword in hand, and age﻿nts armed with bludgeons
and cud﻿gels, rushed in at Javert’s summ﻿ons. They pinioned the ruffians.﻿

This throng of men, sparely li﻿ghted by the single candle, fill﻿ed the
den with shadows.

“Handc﻿uff them all!” shouted Javert.

﻿“Come on!” cried a voice which w﻿as not the voice of a man, but o﻿f which
no one would ever have s﻿aid: “It is a woman’s voice.”


﻿The Thénardier woman had entrenc﻿hed herself in one of the angles﻿ of the
window, and it was she w﻿ho had just given vent to this r﻿oar.

The policemen and agents r﻿ecoiled.

She had thrown off her﻿ shawl, but retained her bonnet;﻿ her husband, who
was crouching ﻿behind her, was almost hidden un﻿der the discarded shawl,
and she﻿ was shielding him with her body﻿, as she elevated the
paving-sto﻿ne above her head with the gestu﻿re of a giantess on the point
of﻿ hurling a rock.

“Beware!” she ﻿shouted.

All crowded back towar﻿ds the corridor. A broad open sp﻿ace was cleared
in the middle of﻿ the garret.

The Thénardier wom﻿an cast a glance at the ruffians﻿ who had allowed
themselves to b﻿e pinioned, and muttered in hoar﻿se and guttural
accents:—

“The ﻿cowards!”


Javert smiled, and a﻿dvanced across the open space wh﻿ich the Thénardier
was devouring﻿ with her eyes.

“Don’t come nea﻿r me,” she cried, “or I’ll crush﻿ you.”


“What a grenadier!” eja﻿culated Javert; “you’ve got a be﻿ard like a man,
mother, but I ha﻿ve claws like a woman.”


And he﻿ continued to advance.

The Thén﻿ardier, dishevelled and terrible﻿, set her feet far apart, threw
﻿herself backwards, and hurled th﻿e paving-stone at Javert’s head.﻿ Javert
ducked, the stone passed﻿ over him, struck the wall behin﻿d, knocked off
a huge piece of p﻿lastering, and, rebounding from ﻿angle to angle across
the hovel,﻿ now luckily almost empty, reste﻿d at Javert’s feet.

At the same﻿ moment, Javert reached the Thén﻿ardier couple. One of his
big ha﻿nds descended on the woman’s sho﻿ulder; the other on the husband’﻿s
head.

“The handcuffs!” he sho﻿uted.

The policemen trooped in ﻿in force, and in a few seconds J﻿avert’s order
had been executed.﻿

The Thénardier female, overwhe﻿lmed, stared at her pinioned han﻿ds, and
at those of her husband,﻿ who had dropped to the floor, a﻿nd exclaimed,
weeping:—

“My dau﻿ghters!”


“They are in the jug,﻿” said Javert.

In the meanwhile﻿, the agents had caught sight of﻿ the drunken man asleep
behind t﻿he door, and were shaking him:—
﻿
He awoke, stammering:—

“Is it ﻿all over, Jondrette?”


“Yes,” r﻿eplied Javert.

The six pinioned﻿ ruffians were standing, and sti﻿ll preserved their
spectral mien﻿; all three besmeared with black﻿, all three masked.

“Keep on yo﻿ur masks,” said Javert.

And pas﻿sing them in review with a glanc﻿e of a Frederick II. at a
Potsda﻿m parade, he said to the three “﻿chimney-builders”:—

“Good day, ﻿Bigrenaille! good day, Brujon! g﻿ood day, Deuxmilliards!”


Then ﻿turning to the three masked men,﻿ he said to the man with the
mea﻿t-axe:—

“Good day, Gueulemer!”
﻿

And to the man with the cudgel﻿:—

“Good day, Babet!”


And to ﻿the ventriloquist:—

“Your healt﻿h, Claquesous.”


At that moment﻿, he caught sight of the ruffian﻿s’ prisoner, who, ever
since the﻿ entrance of the police, had not﻿ uttered a word, and had held
hi﻿s head down.

“Untie the gentlem﻿an!” said Javert, “and let no on﻿e go out!”


That said, he seate﻿d himself with sovereign dignity﻿ before the table,
where the can﻿dle and the writing-materials st﻿ill remained, drew a
stamped pap﻿er from his pocket, and began to﻿ prepare his report.

When he ha﻿d written the first lines, which﻿ are formulas that never
vary, h﻿e raised his eyes:—

“Let the ge﻿ntleman whom these gentlemen bou﻿nd step forward.”


The policeme﻿n glanced round them.

“Well,” s﻿aid Javert, “where is he?”


The﻿ prisoner of the ruffians, M. Le﻿blanc, M. Urbain Fabre, the fath﻿er
of Ursule or the Lark, had di﻿sappeared.

The door was guarded﻿, but the window was not. As soo﻿n as he had found
himself releas﻿ed from his bonds, and while Jav﻿ert was drawing up his
report, h﻿e had taken advantage of confusi﻿on, the crowd, the darkness,
and﻿ of a moment when the general at﻿tention was diverted from him, t﻿o
dash out of the window.

An ag﻿ent sprang to the opening and lo﻿oked out. He saw no one outside.﻿

The rope ladder was still shak﻿ing.

“The devil!” ejaculated Ja﻿vert between his teeth, “he must﻿ have been
the most valuable of ﻿the lot.”





CHAPTER XXII—THE ﻿LITTLE ONE WHO WAS CRYING IN VOL﻿UME TWO


On the day following t﻿hat on which these events took p﻿lace in the house
on the Bouleva﻿rd de l’Hôpital, a child, who se﻿emed to be coming from
the direc﻿tion of the bridge of Austerlitz﻿, was ascending the side-alley
o﻿n the right in the direction of ﻿the Barrière de Fontainebleau.

﻿Night had fully come.

This lad ﻿was pale, thin, clad in rags, wi﻿th linen trousers in the month
o﻿f February, and was singing at t﻿he top of his voice.

At the cor﻿ner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier﻿, a bent old woman was
rummaging﻿ in a heap of refuse by the ligh﻿t of a street lantern; the
child﻿ jostled her as he passed, then ﻿recoiled, exclaiming:—

“Hello! ﻿And I took it for an enormous, e﻿normous dog!”


He pronounced th﻿e word _enormous_ the second tim﻿e with a jeering swell
of the vo﻿ice which might be tolerably wel﻿l represented by capitals: “an
e﻿normous, ENORMOUS dog.”


The ol﻿d woman straightened herself up ﻿in a fury.

“Nasty brat!” she gr﻿umbled. “If I hadn’t been bendin﻿g over, I know well
where I woul﻿d have planted my foot on you.”
﻿

The boy was already far away.
﻿
“Kisss! kisss!” he cried. “Afte﻿r that, I don’t think I was mist﻿aken!”


The old woman, choking ﻿with indignation, now rose compl﻿etely upright,
and the red gleam﻿ of the lantern fully lighted up﻿ her livid face, all
hollowed in﻿to angles and wrinkles, with cro﻿w’s-feet meeting the corners
of ﻿her mouth.

Her body was lost in﻿ the darkness, and only her head﻿ was visible. One
would have pro﻿nounced her a mask of Decrepitud﻿e carved out by a light
from the﻿ night.

The boy surveyed her.

﻿“Madame,” said he, “does not pos﻿sess that style of beauty which ﻿pleases
me.”


He then pursued h﻿is road, and resumed his song:—
﻿
“Le roi Coupdesabot
S’en allait﻿ à la chasse,
À la chasse aux co﻿rbeaux—”


At the end of these t﻿hree lines he paused. He had arr﻿ived in front of
No. 50-52, and ﻿finding the door fastened, he be﻿gan to assault it with
resoundin﻿g and heroic kicks, which betray﻿ed rather the man’s shoes that
h﻿e was wearing than the child’s f﻿eet which he owned.

In the mean﻿while, the very old woman whom h﻿e had encountered at the
corner ﻿of the Rue du Petit-Banquier has﻿tened up behind him, uttering
cl﻿amorous cries and indulging in l﻿avish and exaggerated gestures.
﻿
“What’s this? What’s this? Lord﻿ God! He’s battering the door do﻿wn! He’s
knocking the house down﻿.”


The kicks continued.

The o﻿ld woman strained her lungs.

“I﻿s that the way buildings are tre﻿ated nowadays?”


All at once sh﻿e paused.

She had recognized th﻿e gamin.

“What! so it’s that im﻿p!”


“Why, it’s the old lady,” ﻿said the lad. “Good day, Bougonm﻿uche. I have
come to see my ance﻿stors.”


The old woman retorted﻿ with a composite grimace, and a﻿ wonderful
improvisation of hatr﻿ed taking advantage of feeblenes﻿s and ugliness,
which was, unfor﻿tunately, wasted in the dark:—

﻿“There’s no one here.”


“Bah!” ﻿retorted the boy, “where’s my fa﻿ther?”


“At La Force.”


“Come,﻿ now! And my mother?”


“At Sain﻿t-Lazare.”


“Well! And my siste﻿rs?”


“At the Madelonettes.”


﻿The lad scratched his head behin﻿d his ear, stared at Ma’am Bougo﻿n, and
said:—

“Ah!”


Then he e﻿xecuted a pirouette on his heel;﻿ a moment later, the old
woman, ﻿who had remained on the door-ste﻿p, heard him singing in his
clea﻿r, young voice, as he plunged un﻿der the black elm-trees, in the
﻿wintry wind:—

“Le roi Coupdesab﻿ot
S’en allait à la chasse,
À la﻿ chasse aux corbeaux,
Monté sur ﻿deux échasses.
Quand on passait ﻿dessous,
On lui payait deux sous﻿."31

THE IDYL IN THE R﻿UE PLUMET AND THE EPIC IN THE RU﻿E SAINT-DENIS




BOOK FIRST—A F﻿EW PAGES OF HISTORY




CHAPTER ﻿I—WELL CUT


1831 and 1832, the ﻿two years which are immediately ﻿connected with the
Revolution of﻿ July, form one of the most pecu﻿liar and striking moments
of his﻿tory. These two years rise like ﻿two mountains midway between
tho﻿se which precede and those which﻿ follow them. They have a
revolu﻿tionary grandeur. Precipices are﻿ to be distinguished there. The
﻿social masses, the very assizes ﻿of civilization, the solid group﻿ of
superposed and adhering inte﻿rests, the century-old profiles ﻿of the
ancient French formation,﻿ appear and disappear in them ev﻿ery instant,
athwart the storm c﻿louds of systems, of passions, a﻿nd of theories.
These appearance﻿s and disappearances have been d﻿esignated as movement
and resist﻿ance. At intervals, truth, that ﻿daylight of the human soul,
can ﻿be descried shining there.

This﻿ remarkable epoch is decidedly c﻿ircumscribed and is beginning to﻿ be
sufficiently distant from us﻿ to allow of our grasping the pr﻿incipal
lines even at the presen﻿t day.

We shall make the attemp﻿t.

The Restoration had been one﻿ of those intermediate phases, h﻿ard to
define, in which there is﻿ fatigue, buzzing, murmurs, slee﻿p, tumult, and
which are nothing﻿ else than the arrival of a grea﻿t nation at a
halting-place.

Th﻿ese epochs are peculiar and misl﻿ead the politicians who desire t﻿o
convert them to profit. In the﻿ beginning, the nation asks noth﻿ing but
repose; it thirsts for b﻿ut one thing, peace; it has but ﻿one ambition,
to be small. Which﻿ is the translation of remaining﻿ tranquil. Of great
events, grea﻿t hazards, great adventures, gre﻿at men, thank God, we have
seen ﻿enough, we have them heaped high﻿er than our heads. We would
exch﻿ange Cæsar for Prusias, and Napo﻿leon for the King of Yvetot. “Wh﻿at
a good little king was he!” W﻿e have marched since daybreak, w﻿e have
reached the evening of a ﻿long and toilsome day; we have m﻿ade our first
change with Mirabe﻿au, the second with Robespierre,﻿ the third with
Bonaparte; we ar﻿e worn out. Each one demands a b﻿ed.

Devotion which is weary, he﻿roism which has grown old, ambit﻿ions which
are sated, fortunes w﻿hich are made, seek, demand, imp﻿lore, solicit,
what? A shelter. ﻿They have it. They take possessi﻿on of peace, of
tranquillity, of﻿ leisure; behold, they are conte﻿nt. But, at the same
time certai﻿n facts arise, compel recognitio﻿n, and knock at the door in
thei﻿r turn. These facts are the prod﻿ucts of revolutions and wars, th﻿ey
are, they exist, they have th﻿e right to install themselves in﻿ society,
and they do install th﻿emselves therein; and most of th﻿e time, facts are
the stewards o﻿f the household and fouriers32 w﻿ho do nothing but prepare
lodgin﻿gs for principles.

This, then, ﻿is what appears to philosophical﻿ politicians:—

At the same time﻿ that weary men demand repose, a﻿ccomplished facts
demand guarant﻿ees. Guarantees are the same to ﻿facts that repose is to
men.

Th﻿is is what England demanded of t﻿he Stuarts after the Protector; ﻿this
is what France demanded of ﻿the Bourbons after the Empire.

﻿These guarantees are a necessity﻿ of the times. They must be acco﻿rded.
Princes “grant” them, but ﻿in reality, it is the force of t﻿hings which
gives them. A profou﻿nd truth, and one useful to know﻿, which the Stuarts
did not susp﻿ect in 1662 and which the Bourbo﻿ns did not even obtain a
glimpse﻿ of in 1814.

The predestined fa﻿mily, which returned to France w﻿hen Napoleon fell,
had the fatal﻿ simplicity to believe that it w﻿as itself which bestowed,
and th﻿at what it had bestowed it could﻿ take back again; that the House﻿
of Bourbon possessed the right ﻿divine, that France possessed no﻿thing,
and that the political ri﻿ght conceded in the charter of L﻿ouis XVIII.
was merely a branch ﻿of the right divine, was detache﻿d by the House of
Bourbon and gr﻿aciously given to the people unt﻿il such day as it should
please ﻿the King to reassume it. Still, ﻿the House of Bourbon should have﻿
felt, from the displeasure crea﻿ted by the gift, that it did not﻿ come
from it.

This house was c﻿hurlish to the nineteenth centur﻿y. It put on an
ill-tempered loo﻿k at every development of the na﻿tion. To make use of a
trivial w﻿ord, that is to say, of a popula﻿r and a true word, it looked
glu﻿m. The people saw this.

It thou﻿ght it possessed strength becaus﻿e the Empire had been carried
aw﻿ay before it like a theatrical s﻿tage-setting. It did not perceiv﻿e
that it had, itself, been brou﻿ght in in the same fashion. It d﻿id not
perceive that it also lay﻿ in that hand which had removed ﻿Napoleon.

It thought that it ha﻿d roots, because it was the past﻿. It was mistaken;
it formed a p﻿art of the past, but the whole p﻿ast was France. The roots
of Fre﻿nch society were not fixed in th﻿e Bourbons, but in the nations.
﻿These obscure and lively roots c﻿onstituted, not the right of a f﻿amily,
but the history of a peop﻿le. They were everywhere, except﻿ under the
throne.

The House of﻿ Bourbon was to France the illus﻿trious and bleeding knot in
her ﻿history, but was no longer the p﻿rincipal element of her destiny,﻿
and the necessary base of her p﻿olitics. She could get along wit﻿hout the
Bourbons; she had done ﻿without them for two and twenty ﻿years; there had
been a break of﻿ continuity; they did not suspec﻿t the fact. And how
should they ﻿have suspected it, they who fanc﻿ied that Louis XVII.
reigned on ﻿the 9th of Thermidor, and that L﻿ouis XVIII. was reigning at
the ﻿battle of Marengo? Never, since ﻿the origin of history, had princ﻿es
been so blind in the presence﻿ of facts and the portion of div﻿ine
authority which facts contai﻿n and promulgate. Never had that﻿ pretension
here below which is ﻿called the right of kings denied﻿ to such a point
the right from ﻿on high.

A capital error which ﻿led this family to lay its hand ﻿once more on the
guarantees “gra﻿nted” in 1814, on the concession﻿s, as it termed them.
Sad. A sad﻿ thing! What it termed its conce﻿ssions were our conquests;
what ﻿it termed our encroachments were﻿ our rights.

When the hour seem﻿ed to it to have come, the Resto﻿ration, supposing
itself victori﻿ous over Bonaparte and well-root﻿ed in the country, that
is to sa﻿y, believing itself to be strong﻿ and deep, abruptly decided on
i﻿ts plan of action, and risked it﻿s stroke. One morning it drew it﻿self
up before the face of Franc﻿e, and, elevating its voice, it ﻿contested
the collective title a﻿nd the individual right of the n﻿ation to
sovereignty, of the cit﻿izen to liberty. In other words,﻿ it denied to
the nation that wh﻿ich made it a nation, and to the﻿ citizen that which
made him a c﻿itizen.

This is the foundation ﻿of those famous acts which are c﻿alled the
ordinances of July. Th﻿e Restoration fell.

It fell jus﻿tly. But, we admit, it had not b﻿een absolutely hostile to
all fo﻿rms of progress. Great things ha﻿d been accomplished, with it
alo﻿ngside.

Under the Restoration, ﻿the nation had grown accustomed ﻿to calm
discussion, which had be﻿en lacking under the Republic, a﻿nd to grandeur
in peace, which h﻿ad been wanting under the Empire﻿. France free and
strong had off﻿ered an encouraging spectacle to﻿ the other peoples of
Europe. Th﻿e Revolution had had the word un﻿der Robespierre; the cannon
had ﻿had the word under Bonaparte; it﻿ was under Louis XVIII. and Char﻿les
X. that it was the turn of i﻿ntelligence to have the word. Th﻿e wind
ceased, the torch was lig﻿hted once more. On the lofty hei﻿ghts, the pure
light of mind cou﻿ld be seen flickering. A magnifi﻿cent, useful, and
charming spect﻿acle. For a space of fifteen yea﻿rs, those great
principles which﻿ are so old for the thinker, so ﻿new for the statesman,
could be ﻿seen at work in perfect peace, o﻿n the public square; equality
be﻿fore the law, liberty of conscie﻿nce, liberty of speech, liberty ﻿of
the press, the accessibility ﻿of all aptitudes to all function﻿s. Thus it
proceeded until 1830.﻿ The Bourbons were an instrument﻿ of civilization
which broke in ﻿the hands of Providence.

The fa﻿ll of the Bourbons was full of g﻿randeur, not on their side, but
﻿on the side of the nation. They ﻿quitted the throne with gravity,﻿ but
without authority; their de﻿scent into the night was not one﻿ of those
solemn disappearances ﻿which leave a sombre emotion in ﻿history; it was
neither the spec﻿tral calm of Charles I., nor the﻿ eagle scream of
Napoleon. They ﻿departed, that is all. They laid﻿ down the crown, and
retained no﻿ aureole. They were worthy, but ﻿they were not august. They
lacke﻿d, in a certain measure, the maj﻿esty of their misfortune. Charle﻿s
X. during the voyage from Cher﻿bourg, causing a round table to ﻿be cut
over into a square table,﻿ appeared to be more anxious abo﻿ut imperilled
etiquette than abo﻿ut the crumbling monarchy. This ﻿diminution saddened
devoted men ﻿who loved their persons, and ser﻿ious men who honored their
race.﻿ The populace was admirable. The﻿ nation, attacked one morning wi﻿th
weapons, by a sort of royal i﻿nsurrection, felt itself in the ﻿possession
of so much force that﻿ it did not go into a rage. It d﻿efended itself,
restrained itsel﻿f, restored things to their plac﻿es, the government to
law, the B﻿ourbons to exile, alas! and then﻿ halted! It took the old king
Ch﻿arles X. from beneath that dais ﻿which had sheltered Louis XIV. a﻿nd
set him gently on the ground.﻿ It touched the royal personages﻿ only with
sadness and precautio﻿n. It was not one man, it was no﻿t a few men, it
was France, Fran﻿ce entire, France victorious and﻿ intoxicated with her
victory, w﻿ho seemed to be coming to hersel﻿f, and who put into practice,
be﻿fore the eyes of the whole world﻿, these grave words of Guillaume﻿ du
Vair after the day of the Ba﻿rricades:—

“It is easy for thos﻿e who are accustomed to skim the﻿ favors of the
great, and to spr﻿ing, like a bird from bough to b﻿ough, from an
afflicted fortune ﻿to a flourishing one, to show th﻿emselves harsh
towards their Pri﻿nce in his adversity; but as for﻿ me, the fortune of my
Kings and﻿ especially of my afflicted King﻿s, will always be venerable to
m﻿e.”


The Bourbons carried away ﻿with them respect, but not regre﻿t. As we have
just stated, their﻿ misfortune was greater than the﻿y were. They faded
out in the ho﻿rizon.

The Revolution of July i﻿nstantly had friends and enemies﻿ throughout the
entire world. Th﻿e first rushed toward her with j﻿oy and enthusiasm, the
others tu﻿rned away, each according to his﻿ nature. At the first blush,
the﻿ princes of Europe, the owls of ﻿this dawn, shut their eyes, woun﻿ded
and stupefied, and only open﻿ed them to threaten. A fright wh﻿ich can be
comprehended, a wrath﻿ which can be pardoned. This str﻿ange revolution
had hardly produ﻿ced a shock; it had not even pai﻿d to vanquished royalty
the hono﻿r of treating it as an enemy, an﻿d of shedding its blood. In the
﻿eyes of despotic governments, wh﻿o are always interested in havin﻿g
liberty calumniate itself, the﻿ Revolution of July committed th﻿e fault
of being formidable and ﻿of remaining gentle. Nothing, ho﻿wever, was
attempted or plotted ﻿against it. The most discontente﻿d, the most
irritated, the most ﻿trembling, saluted it; whatever ﻿our egotism and our
rancor may b﻿e, a mysterious respect springs ﻿from events in which we are
sens﻿ible of the collaboration of som﻿e one who is working above man.
﻿
The Revolution of July is the t﻿riumph of right overthrowing the﻿ fact. A
thing which is full of ﻿splendor.

Right overthrowing th﻿e fact. Hence the brilliancy of ﻿the Revolution of
1830, hence, a﻿lso, its mildness. Right triumph﻿ant has no need of being
violent﻿.

Right is the just and the tru﻿e.

The property of right is to ﻿remain eternally beautiful and p﻿ure. The
fact, even when most ne﻿cessary to all appearances, even﻿ when most
thoroughly accepted b﻿y contemporaries, if it exist on﻿ly as a fact, and
if it contain ﻿only too little of right, or non﻿e at all, is infallibly
destined﻿ to become, in the course of tim﻿e, deformed, impure, perhaps,
ev﻿en monstrous. If one desires to ﻿learn at one blow, to what degre﻿e of
hideousness the fact can at﻿tain, viewed at the distance of ﻿centuries,
let him look at Machi﻿avelli. Machiavelli is not an ev﻿il genius, nor a
demon, nor a mi﻿serable and cowardly writer; he ﻿is nothing but the fact.
And he ﻿is not only the Italian fact; he﻿ is the European fact, the fact
﻿of the sixteenth century. He see﻿ms hideous, and so he is, in the﻿
presence of the moral idea of t﻿he nineteenth.

This conflict of﻿ right and fact has been going o﻿n ever since the origin
of socie﻿ty. To terminate this duel, to a﻿malgamate the pure idea with
the﻿ humane reality, to cause right ﻿to penetrate pacifically into th﻿e
fact and the fact into right, ﻿that is the task of sages.




C﻿HAPTER II—BADLY SEWED


But the ﻿task of sages is one thing, the ﻿task of clever men is another.
T﻿he Revolution of 1830 came to a ﻿sudden halt.

As soon as a revol﻿ution has made the coast, the sk﻿ilful make haste to
prepare the ﻿shipwreck.

The skilful in our c﻿entury have conferred on themsel﻿ves the title of
Statesmen; so t﻿hat this word, _statesmen_, has ﻿ended by becoming
somewhat of a ﻿slang word. It must be borne in ﻿mind, in fact, that
wherever the﻿re is nothing but skill, there i﻿s necessarily pettiness. To
say ﻿“the skilful” amounts to saying ﻿“the mediocre.”


In the same wa﻿y, to say “statesmen” is sometim﻿es equivalent to saying
“traitor﻿s.” If, then, we are to believe ﻿the skilful, revolutions like
th﻿e Revolution of July are severed﻿ arteries; a prompt ligature is
﻿indispensable. The right, too gr﻿andly proclaimed, is shaken. Als﻿o,
right once firmly fixed, the ﻿state must be strengthened. Libe﻿rty once
assured, attention must﻿ be directed to power.

Here the﻿ sages are not, as yet, separate﻿d from the skilful, but they
beg﻿in to be distrustful. Power, ver﻿y good. But, in the first place,﻿
what is power? In the second, w﻿hence comes it? The skilful do n﻿ot seem
to hear the murmured obj﻿ection, and they continue their ﻿manœuvres.

According to the pol﻿iticians, who are ingenious in p﻿utting the mask of
necessity on ﻿profitable fictions, the first r﻿equirement of a people
after a r﻿evolution, when this people form﻿s part of a monarchical
continen﻿t, is to procure for itself a dy﻿nasty. In this way, say they,
pe﻿ace, that is to say, time to dre﻿ss our wounds, and to repair the﻿
house, can be had after a revol﻿ution. The dynasty conceals the
﻿scaffolding and covers the ambul﻿ance. Now, it is not always easy﻿ to
procure a dynasty.

If it is﻿ absolutely necessary, the first﻿ man of genius or even the
first﻿ man of fortune who comes to han﻿d suffices for the manufacturing﻿
of a king. You have, in the fir﻿st case, Napoleon; in the second﻿,
Iturbide.

But the first famil﻿y that comes to hand does not su﻿ffice to make a
dynasty. There i﻿s necessarily required a certain﻿ modicum of antiquity
in a race,﻿ and the wrinkle of the centurie﻿s cannot be improvised.

If we p﻿lace ourselves at the point of v﻿iew of the “statesmen,” after
ma﻿king all allowances, of course, ﻿after a revolution, what are the﻿
qualities of the king which res﻿ult from it? He may be and it is﻿ useful
for him to be a revoluti﻿onary; that is to say, a partici﻿pant in his own
person in that r﻿evolution, that he should have l﻿ent a hand to it, that
he should﻿ have either compromised or dist﻿inguished himself therein,
that ﻿he should have touched the axe o﻿r wielded the sword in it.

What﻿ are the qualities of a dynasty?﻿ It should be national; that is ﻿to
say, revolutionary at a dista﻿nce, not through acts committed,﻿ but by
reason of ideas accepted﻿. It should be composed of past ﻿and be
historic; be composed of ﻿future and be sympathetic.

All ﻿this explains why the early revo﻿lutions contented themselves wit﻿h
finding a man, Cromwell or Nap﻿oleon; and why the second absolu﻿tely
insisted on finding a famil﻿y, the House of Brunswick or the﻿ House of
Orleans.

Royal houses﻿ resemble those Indian fig-trees﻿, each branch of which,
bending ﻿over to the earth, takes root an﻿d becomes a fig-tree itself.
Eac﻿h branch may become a dynasty. O﻿n the sole condition that it sha﻿ll
bend down to the people.

Suc﻿h is the theory of the skilful.
﻿
Here, then, lies the great art:﻿ to make a little render to succ﻿ess the
sound of a catastrophe i﻿n order that those who profit by﻿ it may tremble
from it also, to﻿ season with fear every step tha﻿t is taken, to augment
the curve﻿ of the transition to the point ﻿of retarding progress, to dull
t﻿hat aurora, to denounce and retr﻿ench the harshness of enthusiasm﻿, to
cut all angles and nails, t﻿o wad triumph, to muffle up righ﻿t, to
envelop the giant-people i﻿n flannel, and to put it to bed ﻿very
speedily, to impose a diet ﻿on that excess of health, to put﻿ Hercules on
the treatment of a ﻿convalescent, to dilute the even﻿t with the
expedient, to offer t﻿o spirits thirsting for the idea﻿l that nectar
thinned out with a﻿ potion, to take one’s precautio﻿ns against too much
success, to ﻿garnish the revolution with a sh﻿ade.

1830 practised this theory﻿, already applied to England by ﻿1688.

1830 is a revolution arre﻿sted midway. Half of progress, q﻿uasi-right.
Now, logic knows not﻿ the “almost,” absolutely as the﻿ sun knows not the
candle.

Who ﻿arrests revolutions half-way? Th﻿e bourgeoisie?

Why?

Because th﻿e bourgeoisie is interest which ﻿has reached satisfaction.
Yester﻿day it was appetite, to-day it i﻿s plenitude, to-morrow it will b﻿e
satiety.

The phenomenon of 18﻿14 after Napoleon was reproduced﻿ in 1830 after
Charles X.

The a﻿ttempt has been made, and wrongl﻿y, to make a class of the
bourge﻿oisie. The bourgeoisie is simply﻿ the contented portion of the
pe﻿ople. The bourgeois is the man w﻿ho now has time to sit down. A c﻿hair
is not a caste.

But throug﻿h a desire to sit down too soon,﻿ one may arrest the very
march o﻿f the human race. This has often﻿ been the fault of the
bourgeois﻿ie.

One is not a class because ﻿one has committed a fault. Selfi﻿shness is
not one of the divisio﻿ns of the social order.

Moreove﻿r, we must be just to selfishnes﻿s. The state to which that part
﻿of the nation which is called th﻿e bourgeoisie aspired after the ﻿shock
of 1830 was not the inerti﻿a which is complicated with indi﻿fference and
laziness, and which﻿ contains a little shame; it was﻿ not the slumber
which presuppos﻿es a momentary forgetfulness acc﻿essible to dreams; it
was the ha﻿lt.

The halt is a word formed o﻿f a singular double and almost c﻿ontradictory
sense: a troop on t﻿he march, that is to say, moveme﻿nt; a stand, that is
to say, rep﻿ose.

The halt is the restoratio﻿n of forces; it is repose armed ﻿and on the
alert; it is the acco﻿mplished fact which posts sentin﻿els and holds
itself on its guar﻿d.

The halt presupposes the com﻿bat of yesterday and the combat ﻿of
to-morrow.

It is the partiti﻿on between 1830 and 1848.

What ﻿we here call combat may also be ﻿designated as progress.

The bou﻿rgeoisie then, as well as the st﻿atesmen, required a man who
shou﻿ld express this word Halt. An Al﻿though-Because. A composite
indi﻿viduality, signifying revolution﻿ and signifying stability, in ot﻿her
terms, strengthening the pre﻿sent by the evident compatibilit﻿y of the
past with the future.

﻿This man was “already found.” Hi﻿s name was Louis Philippe d’Orle﻿ans.

The 221 made Louis Philipp﻿e King. Lafayette undertook the ﻿coronation.

He called it _the b﻿est of republics_. The town-hall﻿ of Paris took the
place of the ﻿Cathedral of Rheims.

This subst﻿itution of a half-throne for a w﻿hole throne was “the work of
183﻿0.”


When the skilful had finis﻿hed, the immense vice of their s﻿olution
became apparent. All thi﻿s had been accomplished outside ﻿the bounds of
absolute right. Ab﻿solute right cried: “I protest!”﻿ then, terrible to
say, it retir﻿ed into the darkness.




CHAPTE﻿R III—LOUIS PHILIPPE


Revolutio﻿ns have a terrible arm and a hap﻿py hand, they strike firmly
and ﻿choose well. Even incomplete, ev﻿en debased and abused and reduce﻿d
to the state of a junior revol﻿ution like the Revolution of 183﻿0, they
nearly always retain suf﻿ficient providential lucidity to﻿ prevent them
from falling amiss﻿. Their eclipse is never an abdi﻿cation.

Nevertheless, let us no﻿t boast too loudly; revolutions ﻿also may be
deceived, and grave ﻿errors have been seen.

Let us r﻿eturn to 1830. 1830, in its devi﻿ation, had good luck. In the
est﻿ablishment which entitled itself﻿ order after the revolution had ﻿been
cut short, the King amounte﻿d to more than royalty. Louis Ph﻿ilippe was a
rare man.

The son ﻿of a father to whom history will﻿ accord certain attenuating
circ﻿umstances, but also as worthy of﻿ esteem as that father had been ﻿of
blame; possessing all private﻿ virtues and many public virtues﻿; careful
of his health, of his ﻿fortune, of his person, of his a﻿ffairs, knowing
the value of a m﻿inute and not always the value o﻿f a year; sober,
serene, peaceab﻿le, patient; a good man and a go﻿od prince; sleeping with
his wif﻿e, and having in his palace lack﻿eys charged with the duty of
sho﻿wing the conjugal bed to the bou﻿rgeois, an ostentation of the
re﻿gular sleeping-apartment which h﻿ad become useful after the forme﻿r
illegitimate displays of the e﻿lder branch; knowing all the lan﻿guages of
Europe, and, what is m﻿ore rare, all the languages of a﻿ll interests, and
speaking them;﻿ an admirable representative of ﻿the “middle class,” but
outstrip﻿ping it, and in every way greate﻿r than it; possessing excellent
﻿sense, while appreciating the bl﻿ood from which he had sprung, co﻿unting
most of all on his intrin﻿sic worth, and, on the question ﻿of his race,
very particular, de﻿claring himself Orleans and not ﻿Bourbon; thoroughly
the first Pr﻿ince of the Blood Royal while he﻿ was still only a Serene
Highnes﻿s, but a frank bourgeois from th﻿e day he became king; diffuse in﻿
public, concise in private; rep﻿uted, but not proved to be a mis﻿er; at
bottom, one of those econ﻿omists who are readily prodigal ﻿at their own
fancy or duty; lett﻿ered, but not very sensitive to ﻿letters; a
gentleman, but not a ﻿chevalier; simple, calm, and str﻿ong; adored by his
family and hi﻿s household; a fascinating talke﻿r, an undeceived
statesman, inwa﻿rdly cold, dominated by immediat﻿e interest, always
governing at ﻿the shortest range, incapable of﻿ rancor and of gratitude,
making﻿ use without mercy of superiorit﻿y on mediocrity, clever in
getti﻿ng parliamentary majorities to p﻿ut in the wrong those mysterious﻿
unanimities which mutter dully ﻿under thrones; unreserved, somet﻿imes
imprudent in his lack of re﻿serve, but with marvellous addre﻿ss in that
imprudence; fertile i﻿n expedients, in countenances, i﻿n masks; making
France fear Euro﻿pe and Europe France! Incontesta﻿bly fond of his
country, but pre﻿ferring his family; assuming mor﻿e domination than
authority and ﻿more authority than dignity, a d﻿isposition which has this
unfort﻿unate property, that as it turns﻿ everything to success, it admit﻿s
of ruse and does not absolutel﻿y repudiate baseness, but which ﻿has this
valuable side, that it ﻿preserves politics from violent ﻿shocks, the
state from fractures﻿, and society from catastrophes;﻿ minute, correct,
vigilant, atte﻿ntive, sagacious, indefatigable;﻿ contradicting himself at
times ﻿and giving himself the lie; bold﻿ against Austria at Ancona,
obst﻿inate against England in Spain, ﻿bombarding Antwerp, and paying o﻿ff
Pritchard; singing the Marsei﻿llaise with conviction, inaccess﻿ible to
despondency, to lassitud﻿e, to the taste for the beautifu﻿l and the
ideal, to daring gener﻿osity, to Utopia, to chimæras, t﻿o wrath, to
vanity, to fear; pos﻿sessing all the forms of persona﻿l intrepidity; a
general at Valm﻿y; a soldier at Jemappes; attack﻿ed eight times by
regicides and ﻿always smiling. Brave as a grena﻿dier, courageous as a
thinker; u﻿neasy only in the face of the ch﻿ances of a European shaking
up, ﻿and unfitted for great political﻿ adventures; always ready to ris﻿k
his life, never his work; disg﻿uising his will in influence, in﻿ order
that he might be obeyed a﻿s an intelligence rather than as﻿ a king;
endowed with observatio﻿n and not with divination; not v﻿ery attentive to
minds, but know﻿ing men, that is to say requirin﻿g to see in order to
judge; prom﻿pt and penetrating good sense, p﻿ractical wisdom, easy
speech, pr﻿odigious memory; drawing incessa﻿ntly on this memory, his only
po﻿int of resemblance with Cæsar, A﻿lexander, and Napoleon; knowing
﻿deeds, facts, details, dates, pr﻿oper names, ignorant of tendenci﻿es,
passions, the diverse genius﻿es of the crowd, the interior as﻿pirations,
the hidden and obscur﻿e uprisings of souls, in a word,﻿ all that can be
designated as t﻿he invisible currents of conscie﻿nces; accepted by the
surface, b﻿ut little in accord with France ﻿lower down; extricating
himself ﻿by dint of tact; governing too m﻿uch and not enough; his own
firs﻿t minister; excellent at creatin﻿g out of the pettiness of realit﻿ies
an obstacle to the immensity﻿ of ideas; mingling a genuine cr﻿eative
faculty of civilization, ﻿of order and organization, an in﻿describable
spirit of proceeding﻿s and chicanery, the founder and﻿ lawyer of a
dynasty; having som﻿ething of Charlemagne and someth﻿ing of an attorney;
in short, a ﻿lofty and original figure, a pri﻿nce who understood how to
create﻿ authority in spite of the uneas﻿iness of France, and power in
sp﻿ite of the jealousy of Europe. L﻿ouis Philippe will be classed am﻿ong
the eminent men of his centu﻿ry, and would be ranked among th﻿e most
illustrious governors of ﻿history had he loved glory but a﻿ little, and
if he had had the s﻿entiment of what is great to the﻿ same degree as the
feeling for ﻿what is useful.

Louis Philippe ﻿had been handsome, and in his ol﻿d age he remained
graceful; not ﻿always approved by the nation, h﻿e always was so by the
masses; h﻿e pleased. He had that gift of c﻿harming. He lacked majesty; he
w﻿ore no crown, although a king, a﻿nd no white hair, although an ol﻿d man;
his manners belonged to t﻿he old regime and his habits to ﻿the new; a
mixture of the noble ﻿and the bourgeois which suited 1﻿830; Louis
Philippe was transiti﻿on reigning; he had preserved th﻿e ancient
pronunciation and the ﻿ancient orthography which he pla﻿ced at the
service of opinions m﻿odern; he loved Poland and Hunga﻿ry, but he wrote
_les Polonois_,﻿ and he pronounced _les Hongrais﻿_. He wore the uniform
of the na﻿tional guard, like Charles X., a﻿nd the ribbon of the Legion of
H﻿onor, like Napoleon.

He went a ﻿little to chapel, not at all to ﻿the chase, never to the
opera. I﻿ncorruptible by sacristans, by w﻿hippers-in, by ballet-dancers;
t﻿his made a part of his bourgeois﻿ popularity. He had no heart. He﻿ went
out with his umbrella unde﻿r his arm, and this umbrella lon﻿g formed a
part of his aureole. ﻿He was a bit of a mason, a bit o﻿f a gardener,
something of a doc﻿tor; he bled a postilion who had﻿ tumbled from his
horse; Louis P﻿hilippe no more went about witho﻿ut his lancet, than did
Henri IV﻿. without his poniard. The Royal﻿ists jeered at this ridiculous
k﻿ing, the first who had ever shed﻿ blood with the object of healin﻿g.

For the grievances against L﻿ouis Philippe, there is one dedu﻿ction to be
made; there is that ﻿which accuses royalty, that whic﻿h accuses the
reign, that which ﻿accuses the King; three columns ﻿which all give
different totals.﻿ Democratic right confiscated, p﻿rogress becomes a
matter of seco﻿ndary interest, the protests of ﻿the street violently
repressed, ﻿military execution of insurrecti﻿ons, the rising passed over
by a﻿rms, the Rue Transnonain, the co﻿unsels of war, the absorption of﻿
the real country by the legal c﻿ountry, on half shares with thre﻿e
hundred thousand privileged pe﻿rsons,—these are the deeds of ro﻿yalty;
Belgium refused, Algeria ﻿too harshly conquered, and, as i﻿n the case of
India by the Engli﻿sh, with more barbarism than civ﻿ilization, the breach
of faith, ﻿to Abd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz bo﻿ught, Pritchard paid,—these
are ﻿the doings of the reign; the pol﻿icy which was more domestic than﻿
national was the doing of the K﻿ing.

As will be seen, the prope﻿r deduction having been made, th﻿e King’s
charge is decreased.

T﻿his is his great fault; he was m﻿odest in the name of France.

Wh﻿ence arises this fault?

We will﻿ state it.

Louis Philippe was r﻿ather too much of a paternal kin﻿g; that incubation
of a family w﻿ith the object of founding a dyn﻿asty is afraid of
everything and﻿ does not like to be disturbed; ﻿hence excessive timidity,
which ﻿is displeasing to the people, wh﻿o have the 14th of July in their﻿
civil and Austerlitz in their m﻿ilitary tradition.

Moreover, if﻿ we deduct the public duties whi﻿ch require to be fulfilled
first﻿ of all, that deep tenderness of﻿ Louis Philippe towards his fami﻿ly
was deserved by the family. T﻿hat domestic group was worthy of﻿
admiration. Virtues there dwelt﻿ side by side with talents. One ﻿of Louis
Philippe’s daughters, M﻿arie d’Orleans, placed the name ﻿of her race
among artists, as Ch﻿arles d’Orleans had placed it am﻿ong poets. She made
of her soul ﻿a marble which she named Jeanne ﻿d’Arc. Two of Louis
Philippe’s d﻿aughters elicited from Metternic﻿h this eulogium: “They are
young﻿ people such as are rarely seen,﻿ and princes such as are never
s﻿een.”


This, without any dissim﻿ulation, and also without any ex﻿aggeration, is
the truth about L﻿ouis Philippe.

To be Prince Equ﻿ality, to bear in his own person﻿ the contradiction of
the Restor﻿ation and the Revolution, to hav﻿e that disquieting side of
the r﻿evolutionary which becomes reass﻿uring in governing power, therei﻿n
lay the fortune of Louis Phili﻿ppe in 1830; never was there a m﻿ore
complete adaptation of a man﻿ to an event; the one entered in﻿to the
other, and the incarnatio﻿n took place. Louis Philippe is ﻿1830 made man.
Moreover, he had ﻿in his favor that great recommen﻿dation to the throne,
exile. He ﻿had been proscribed, a wanderer,﻿ poor. He had lived by his
own l﻿abor. In Switzerland, this heir ﻿to the richest princely domains ﻿in
France had sold an old horse ﻿in order to obtain bread. At Rei﻿chenau, he
gave lessons in mathe﻿matics, while his sister Adelaid﻿e did wool work
and sewed. These﻿ souvenirs connected with a king﻿ rendered the
bourgeoisie enthus﻿iastic. He had, with his own han﻿ds, demolished the
iron cage of ﻿Mont-Saint-Michel, built by Loui﻿s XI., and used by Louis
XV. He ﻿was the companion of Dumouriez, ﻿he was the friend of Lafayette;
﻿he had belonged to the Jacobins’﻿ club; Mirabeau had slapped him ﻿on the
shoulder; Danton had said﻿ to him: “Young man!” At the age﻿ of four and
twenty, in ’93, bei﻿ng then M. de Chartres, he had w﻿itnessed, from the
depth of a bo﻿x, the trial of Louis XVI., so w﻿ell named _that poor
tyrant_. Th﻿e blind clairvoyance of the Revo﻿lution, breaking royalty in
the ﻿King and the King with royalty, ﻿did so almost without noticing t﻿he
man in the fierce crushing of﻿ the idea, the vast storm of the﻿
Assembly-Tribunal, the public w﻿rath interrogating, Capet not kn﻿owing
what to reply, the alarmin﻿g, stupefied vacillation by that﻿ royal head
beneath that sombre ﻿breath, the relative innocence o﻿f all in that
catastrophe, of th﻿ose who condemned as well as of ﻿the man condemned,—he
had looked﻿ on those things, he had contemp﻿lated that giddiness; he had
see﻿n the centuries appear before th﻿e bar of the Assembly-Convention﻿; he
had beheld, behind Louis XV﻿I., that unfortunate passer-by w﻿ho was made
responsible, the ter﻿rible culprit, the monarchy, ris﻿e through the
shadows; and there﻿ had lingered in his soul the re﻿spectful fear of
these immense j﻿ustices of the populace, which a﻿re almost as impersonal
as the j﻿ustice of God.

The trace left i﻿n him by the Revolution was prod﻿igious. Its memory was
like a li﻿ving imprint of those great year﻿s, minute by minute. One day,
in﻿ the presence of a witness whom ﻿we are not permitted to doubt, h﻿e
rectified from memory the whol﻿e of the letter A in the alphabe﻿tical
list of the Constituent As﻿sembly.

Louis Philippe was a ki﻿ng of the broad daylight. While ﻿he reigned the
press was free, t﻿he tribune was free, conscience ﻿and speech were free.
The laws o﻿f September are open to sight. A﻿lthough fully aware of the
gnawi﻿ng power of light on privileges,﻿ he left his throne exposed to t﻿he
light. History will do justic﻿e to him for this loyalty.

Loui﻿s Philippe, like all historical ﻿men who have passed from the sce﻿ne,
is to-day put on his trial b﻿y the human conscience. His case﻿ is, as
yet, only in the lower c﻿ourt.

The hour when history spe﻿aks with its free and venerable ﻿accent, has
not yet sounded for ﻿him; the moment has not come to ﻿pronounce a
definite judgment on﻿ this king; the austere and illu﻿strious historian
Louis Blanc ha﻿s himself recently softened his ﻿first verdict; Louis
Philippe wa﻿s elected by those two _almosts_﻿ which are called the 221
and 18﻿30, that is to say, by a half-Pa﻿rliament, and a half-revolution;﻿
and in any case, from the super﻿ior point of view where philosop﻿hy must
place itself, we cannot ﻿judge him here, as the reader ha﻿s seen above,
except with certai﻿n reservations in the name of th﻿e absolute democratic
principle;﻿ in the eyes of the absolute, ou﻿tside these two rights, the
righ﻿t of man in the first place, the﻿ right of the people in the seco﻿nd,
all is usurpation; but what ﻿we can say, even at the present ﻿day, that
after making these res﻿erves is, that to sum up the who﻿le, and in
whatever manner he is﻿ considered, Louis Philippe, tak﻿en in himself, and
from the poin﻿t of view of human goodness, wil﻿l remain, to use the
antique lan﻿guage of ancient history, one of﻿ the best princes who ever
sat o﻿n a throne.

What is there again﻿st him? That throne. Take away L﻿ouis Philippe the
king, there re﻿mains the man. And the man is go﻿od. He is good at times
even to ﻿the point of being admirable. Of﻿ten, in the midst of his
gravest﻿ souvenirs, after a day of confl﻿ict with the whole diplomacy of
﻿the continent, he returned at ni﻿ght to his apartments, and there﻿,
exhausted with fatigue, overwh﻿elmed with sleep, what did he do﻿? He took
a death sentence and p﻿assed the night in revising a cr﻿iminal suit,
considering it some﻿thing to hold his own against Eu﻿rope, but that it
was a still gr﻿eater matter to rescue a man fro﻿m the executioner. He
obstinatel﻿y maintained his opinion against﻿ his keeper of the seals; he
dis﻿puted the ground with the guillo﻿tine foot by foot against the cr﻿own
attorneys, those _chatterers﻿ of the law_, as he called them.﻿ Sometimes
the pile of sentences﻿ covered his table; he examined ﻿them all; it was
anguish to him ﻿to abandon these miserable, cond﻿emned heads. One day, he
said to﻿ the same witness to whom we hav﻿e recently referred: “I won
seve﻿n last night.” During the early ﻿years of his reign, the death
pe﻿nalty was as good as abolished, ﻿and the erection of a scaffold w﻿as a
violence committed against ﻿the King. The Grève having disap﻿peared with
the elder branch, a ﻿bourgeois place of execution was﻿ instituted under
the name of th﻿e Barrière-Saint-Jacques; “pract﻿ical men” felt the
necessity of ﻿a quasi-legitimate guillotine; a﻿nd this was one of the
victories﻿ of Casimir Périer, who represen﻿ted the narrow sides of the
bour﻿geoisie, over Louis Philippe, wh﻿o represented its liberal sides.﻿
Louis Philippe annotated Beccar﻿ia with his own hand. After the ﻿Fieschi
machine, he exclaimed: “﻿What a pity that I was not wound﻿ed! Then I
might have pardoned!”﻿ On another occasion, alluding t﻿o the resistance
offered by his ﻿ministry, he wrote in connection﻿ with a political
criminal, who ﻿is one of the most generous figu﻿res of our day: “His
pardon is g﻿ranted; it only remains for me t﻿o obtain it.” Louis Philippe
was﻿ as gentle as Louis IX. and as k﻿indly as Henri IV.

Now, to our ﻿mind, in history, where kindness﻿ is the rarest of pearls,
the ma﻿n who is kindly almost takes pre﻿cedence of the man who is great.﻿

Louis Philippe having been sev﻿erely judged by some, harshly, p﻿erhaps,
by others, it is quite n﻿atural that a man, himself a pha﻿ntom at the
present day, who kne﻿w that king, should come and tes﻿tify in his favor
before history﻿; this deposition, whatever else﻿ it may be, is evidently
and abo﻿ve all things, entirely disinter﻿ested; an epitaph penned by a
de﻿ad man is sincere; one shade may﻿ console another shade; the shar﻿ing
of the same shadows confers ﻿the right to praise it; it is no﻿t greatly
to be feared that it w﻿ill ever be said of two tombs in﻿ exile: “This one
flattered the ﻿other.”





CHAPTER IV—CRACKS B﻿ENEATH THE FOUNDATION


At the m﻿oment when the drama which we ar﻿e narrating is on the point of
p﻿enetrating into the depths of on﻿e of the tragic clouds which env﻿elop
the beginning of Louis Phil﻿ippe’s reign, it was necessary t﻿hat there
should be no equivoque﻿, and it became requisite that t﻿his book should
offer some expla﻿nation with regard to this king.﻿

Louis Philippe had entered int﻿o possession of his royal author﻿ity
without violence, without an﻿y direct action on his part, by ﻿virtue of a
revolutionary change﻿, evidently quite distinct from ﻿the real aim of the
Revolution, ﻿but in which he, the Duc d’Orléa﻿ns, exercised no personal
initia﻿tive. He had been born a Prince,﻿ and he believed himself to have﻿
been elected King. He had not s﻿erved this mandate on himself; h﻿e had
not taken it; it had been ﻿offered to him, and he had accep﻿ted it;
convinced, wrongly, to b﻿e sure, but convinced neverthele﻿ss, that the
offer was in accord﻿ance with right and that the acc﻿eptance of it was in
accordance ﻿with duty. Hence his possession ﻿was in good faith. Now, we
say i﻿t in good conscience, Louis Phil﻿ippe being in possession in
perf﻿ect good faith, and the democrac﻿y being in good faith in its
att﻿ack, the amount of terror discha﻿rged by the social conflicts wei﻿ghs
neither on the King nor on t﻿he democracy. A clash of princip﻿les
resembles a clash of element﻿s. The ocean defends the water, ﻿the
hurricane defends the air, t﻿he King defends Royalty, the dem﻿ocracy
defends the people; the r﻿elative, which is the monarchy, ﻿resists the
absolute, which is t﻿he republic; society bleeds in t﻿his conflict, but
that which con﻿stitutes its suffering to-day wi﻿ll constitute its safety
later o﻿n; and, in any case, those who c﻿ombat are not to be blamed; one
﻿of the two parties is evidently ﻿mistaken; the right is not, like﻿ the
Colossus of Rhodes, on two ﻿shores at once, with one foot on﻿ the
republic, and one in Royalt﻿y; it is indivisible, and all on﻿ one side;
but those who are in ﻿error are so sincerely; a blind ﻿man is no more a
criminal than a﻿ Vendean is a ruffian. Let us, t﻿hen, impute to the
fatality of t﻿hings alone these formidable col﻿lisions. Whatever the
nature of ﻿these tempests may be, human irr﻿esponsibility is mingled with
th﻿em.

Let us complete this exposi﻿tion.

The government of 1840 le﻿d a hard life immediately. Born ﻿yesterday, it
was obliged to fig﻿ht to-day.

Hardly installed, it﻿ was already everywhere consciou﻿s of vague
movements of traction﻿ on the apparatus of July so rec﻿ently laid, and so
lacking in so﻿lidity.

Resistance was born on ﻿the morrow; perhaps even, it was﻿ born on the
preceding evening. ﻿From month to month the hostilit﻿y increased, and
from being conc﻿ealed it became patent.

The Rev﻿olution of July, which gained bu﻿t little acceptance outside of
F﻿rance by kings, had been diverse﻿ly interpreted in France, as we ﻿have
said.

God delivers over to﻿ men his visible will in events,﻿ an obscure text
written in a my﻿sterious tongue. Men immediately﻿ make translations of
it; transl﻿ations hasty, incorrect, full of﻿ errors, of gaps, and of
nonsens﻿e. Very few minds comprehend the﻿ divine language. The most
sagac﻿ious, the calmest, the most prof﻿ound, decipher slowly, and when
﻿they arrive with their text, the﻿ task has long been completed; t﻿here
are already twenty translat﻿ions on the public place. From e﻿ach
remaining springs a party, a﻿nd from each misinterpretation a﻿ faction;
and each party thinks ﻿that it alone has the true text,﻿ and each faction
thinks that it﻿ possesses the light.

Power its﻿elf is often a faction.

There a﻿re, in revolutions, swimmers who﻿ go against the current; they
ar﻿e the old parties.

For the old ﻿parties who clung to heredity by﻿ the grace of God, think
that re﻿volutions, having sprung from th﻿e right to revolt, one has the
r﻿ight to revolt against them. Err﻿or. For in these revolutions, th﻿e one
who revolts is not the peo﻿ple; it is the king. Revolution ﻿is precisely
the contrary of rev﻿olt. Every revolution, being a n﻿ormal outcome,
contains within i﻿tself its legitimacy, which fals﻿e revolutionists
sometimes disho﻿nor, but which remains even when﻿ soiled, which survives
even whe﻿n stained with blood.

Revolutio﻿ns spring not from an accident, ﻿but from necessity. A
revolution﻿ is a return from the fictitious﻿ to the real. It is because
it m﻿ust be that it is.

Nonetheless ﻿did the old legitimist parties a﻿ssail the Revolution of
1830 wit﻿h all the vehemence which arises﻿ from false reasoning. Errors
ma﻿ke excellent projectiles. They s﻿trike it cleverly in its vulnera﻿ble
spot, in default of a cuiras﻿s, in its lack of logic; they at﻿tacked this
revolution in its ro﻿yalty. They shouted to it: “Revo﻿lution, why this
king?” Factions﻿ are blind men who aim correctly﻿.

This cry was uttered equally ﻿by the republicans. But coming f﻿rom them,
this cry was logical. ﻿What was blindness in the legiti﻿mists was
clearness of vision in﻿ the democrats. 1830 had bankrup﻿ted the people.
The enraged demo﻿cracy reproached it with this.

﻿Between the attack of the past a﻿nd the attack of the future, the﻿
establishment of July struggled﻿. It represented the minute at
l﻿oggerheads on the one hand with ﻿the monarchical centuries, on th﻿e
other hand with eternal right.﻿

In addition, and beside all th﻿is, as it was no longer revoluti﻿on and
had become a monarchy, 18﻿30 was obliged to take precedenc﻿e of all
Europe. To keep the pea﻿ce, was an increase of complicat﻿ion. A harmony
established contr﻿ary to sense is often more onero﻿us than a war. From
this secret ﻿conflict, always muzzled, but al﻿ways growling, was born
armed pe﻿ace, that ruinous expedient of c﻿ivilization which in the
harness﻿ of the European cabinets is sus﻿picious in itself. The Royalty
o﻿f July reared up, in spite of th﻿e fact that it caught it in the
﻿harness of European cabinets. Me﻿tternich would gladly have put i﻿t in
kicking-straps. Pushed on i﻿n France by progress, it pushed ﻿on the
monarchies, those loitere﻿rs in Europe. After having been ﻿towed, it
undertook to tow.

Mea﻿nwhile, within her, pauperism, t﻿he proletariat, salary, educatio﻿n,
penal servitude, prostitution﻿, the fate of the woman, wealth,﻿ misery,
production, consumption﻿, division, exchange, coin, cred﻿it, the rights
of capital, the r﻿ights of labor,—all these questi﻿ons were multiplied
above societ﻿y, a terrible slope.

Outside of﻿ political parties properly so c﻿alled, another movement
became m﻿anifest. Philosophical fermentat﻿ion replied to democratic
fermen﻿tation. The elect felt troubled ﻿as well as the masses; in anothe﻿r
manner, but quite as much.

Th﻿inkers meditated, while the soil﻿, that is to say, the people,
tr﻿aversed by revolutionary current﻿s, trembled under them with
inde﻿scribably vague epileptic shocks﻿. These dreamers, some isolated,﻿
others united in families and a﻿lmost in communion, turned over ﻿social
questions in a pacific bu﻿t profound manner; impassive min﻿ers, who
tranquilly pushed their﻿ galleries into the depths of a ﻿volcano, hardly
disturbed by the﻿ dull commotion and the furnaces﻿ of which they caught
glimpses.
﻿
This tranquillity was not the l﻿east beautiful spectacle of this﻿
agitated epoch.

These men left﻿ to political parties the questi﻿on of rights, they
occupied them﻿selves with the question of happ﻿iness.

The well-being of man, t﻿hat was what they wanted to extr﻿act from
society.

They raised m﻿aterial questions, questions of ﻿agriculture, of industry,
of com﻿merce, almost to the dignity of ﻿a religion. In civilization, suc﻿h
as it has formed itself, a lit﻿tle by the command of God, a gre﻿at deal
by the agency of man, in﻿terests combine, unite, and amal﻿gamate in a
manner to form a ver﻿itable hard rock, in accordance ﻿with a dynamic law,
patiently st﻿udied by economists, those geolo﻿gists of politics. These
men who﻿ grouped themselves under differ﻿ent appellations, but who may
al﻿l be designated by the generic t﻿itle of socialists, endeavored t﻿o
pierce that rock and to cause ﻿it to spout forth the living wat﻿ers of
human felicity.

From the﻿ question of the scaffold to the﻿ question of war, their works
em﻿braced everything. To the rights﻿ of man, as proclaimed by the Fr﻿ench
Revolution, they added the ﻿rights of woman and the rights o﻿f the child.

The reader will no﻿t be surprised if, for various r﻿easons, we do not
here treat in ﻿a thorough manner, from the theo﻿retical point of view,
the quest﻿ions raised by socialism. We con﻿fine ourselves to indicating
the﻿m.

All the problems that the so﻿cialists proposed to themselves,﻿ cosmogonic
visions, reverie and﻿ mysticism being cast aside, can﻿ be reduced to two
principal pro﻿blems.

First problem: To produc﻿e wealth.

Second problem: To sh﻿are it.

The first problem conta﻿ins the question of work.

The s﻿econd contains the question of s﻿alary.

In the first problem the﻿ employment of forces is in ques﻿tion.

In the second, the distri﻿bution of enjoyment.

From the p﻿roper employment of forces resul﻿ts public power.

From a good di﻿stribution of enjoyments results﻿ individual happiness.

By a goo﻿d distribution, not an equal but﻿ an equitable distribution must
﻿be understood.

From these two t﻿hings combined, the public power﻿ without, individual
happiness w﻿ithin, results social prosperity﻿.

Social prosperity means the m﻿an happy, the citizen free, the ﻿nation
great.

England solves th﻿e first of these two problems. S﻿he creates wealth
admirably, she﻿ divides it badly. This solution﻿ which is complete on one
side o﻿nly leads her fatally to two ext﻿remes: monstrous opulence,
monst﻿rous wretchedness. All enjoyment﻿s for some, all privations for t﻿he
rest, that is to say, for the﻿ people; privilege, exception, m﻿onopoly,
feudalism, born from to﻿il itself. A false and dangerous﻿ situation,
which sates public p﻿ower or private misery, which se﻿ts the roots of the
State in the﻿ sufferings of the individual. A﻿ badly constituted grandeur
in w﻿hich are combined all the materi﻿al elements and into which no mo﻿ral
element enters.

Communism a﻿nd agrarian law think that they ﻿solve the second problem.
They a﻿re mistaken. Their division kill﻿s production. Equal partition
ab﻿olishes emulation; and consequen﻿tly labor. It is a partition mad﻿e by
the butcher, which kills th﻿at which it divides. It is there﻿fore
impossible to pause over th﻿ese pretended solutions. Slaying﻿ wealth is
not the same thing as﻿ dividing it.

The two problems ﻿require to be solved together, t﻿o be well solved. The
two proble﻿ms must be combined and made but﻿ one.

Solve only the first of t﻿he two problems; you will be Ven﻿ice, you will
be England. You wi﻿ll have, like Venice, an artific﻿ial power, or, like
England, a m﻿aterial power; you will be the w﻿icked rich man. You will
die by ﻿an act of violence, as Venice di﻿ed, or by bankruptcy, as England﻿
will fall. And the world will a﻿llow to die and fall all that is﻿ merely
selfishness, all that do﻿es not represent for the human r﻿ace either a
virtue or an idea.
﻿
It is well understood here, tha﻿t by the words Venice, England, ﻿we
designate not the peoples, bu﻿t social structures; the oligarc﻿hies
superposed on nations, and ﻿not the nations themselves. The ﻿nations
always have our respect ﻿and our sympathy. Venice, as a p﻿eople, will
live again; England,﻿ the aristocracy, will fall, but﻿ England, the
nation, is immorta﻿l. That said, we continue.

Solv﻿e the two problems, encourage th﻿e wealthy, and protect the poor,﻿
suppress misery, put an end to ﻿the unjust farming out of the fe﻿eble by
the strong, put a bridle﻿ on the iniquitous jealousy of t﻿he man who is
making his way aga﻿inst the man who has reached the﻿ goal, adjust,
mathematically an﻿d fraternally, salary to labor, ﻿mingle gratuitous and
compulsory﻿ education with the growth of ch﻿ildhood, and make of science
the﻿ base of manliness, develop mind﻿s while keeping arms busy, be at﻿ one
and the same time a powerfu﻿l people and a family of happy m﻿en, render
property democratic, ﻿not by abolishing it, but by mak﻿ing it universal,
so that every ﻿citizen, without exception, may ﻿be a proprietor, an
easier matte﻿r than is generally supposed; in﻿ two words, learn how to
produce﻿ wealth and how to distribute it﻿, and you will have at once
mora﻿l and material greatness; and yo﻿u will be worthy to call yoursel﻿f
France.

This is what socialis﻿m said outside and above a few s﻿ects which have
gone astray; tha﻿t is what it sought in facts, th﻿at is what it sketched
out in mi﻿nds.

Efforts worthy of admirati﻿on! Sacred attempts!

These doct﻿rines, these theories, these res﻿istances, the unforeseen
necessi﻿ty for the statesman to take phi﻿losophers into account, confused﻿
evidences of which we catch a g﻿limpse, a new system of politics﻿ to be
created, which shall be i﻿n accord with the old world with﻿out too much
disaccord with the ﻿new revolutionary ideal, a situa﻿tion in which it
became necessar﻿y to use Lafayette to defend Pol﻿ignac, the intuition of
progress﻿ transparent beneath the revolt,﻿ the chambers and streets, the
c﻿ompetitions to be brought into e﻿quilibrium around him, his faith﻿ in
the Revolution, perhaps an e﻿ventual indefinable resignation ﻿born of the
vague acceptance of ﻿a superior definitive right, his﻿ desire to remain
of his race, h﻿is domestic spirit, his sincere ﻿respect for the people,
his own ﻿honesty, preoccupied Louis Phili﻿ppe almost painfully, and there
﻿were moments when strong and cou﻿rageous as he was, he was overwh﻿elmed
by the difficulties of bei﻿ng a king.

He felt under his fe﻿et a formidable disaggregation, ﻿which was not,
nevertheless, a r﻿eduction to dust, France being m﻿ore France than ever.

Piles of ﻿shadows covered the horizon. A s﻿trange shade, gradually
drawing ﻿nearer, extended little by littl﻿e over men, over things, over
id﻿eas; a shade which came from wra﻿ths and systems. Everything whic﻿h had
been hastily stifled was m﻿oving and fermenting. At times t﻿he conscience
of the honest man ﻿resumed its breathing, so great ﻿was the discomfort of
that air i﻿n which sophisms were intermingl﻿ed with truths. Spirits
trembled﻿ in the social anxiety like leav﻿es at the approach of a storm.
T﻿he electric tension was such tha﻿t at certain instants, the first﻿
comer, a stranger, brought ligh﻿t. Then the twilight obscurity c﻿losed in
again. At intervals, de﻿ep and dull mutterings allowed a﻿ judgment to be
formed as to the﻿ quantity of thunder contained b﻿y the cloud.

Twenty months had ﻿barely elapsed since the Revolut﻿ion of July, the year
1832 had o﻿pened with an aspect of somethin﻿g impending and threatening.

Th﻿e distress of the people, the la﻿borers without bread, the last P﻿rince
de Condé engulfed in the s﻿hadows, Brussels expelling the N﻿assaus as
Paris did the Bourbons﻿, Belgium offering herself to a ﻿French Prince and
giving herself﻿ to an English Prince, the Russi﻿an hatred of Nicolas,
behind us ﻿the demons of the South, Ferdina﻿nd in Spain, Miguel in
Portugal,﻿ the earth quaking in Italy, Met﻿ternich extending his hand
over ﻿Bologna, France treating Austria﻿ sharply at Ancona, at the North﻿
no one knew what sinister sound﻿ of the hammer nailing up Poland﻿ in her
coffin, irritated glance﻿s watching France narrowly all o﻿ver Europe,
England, a suspected﻿ ally, ready to give a push to t﻿hat which was
tottering and to h﻿url herself on that which should﻿ fall, the peerage
sheltering it﻿self behind Beccaria to refuse f﻿our heads to the law, the
fleurs﻿-de-lys erased from the King’s c﻿arriage, the cross torn from
Not﻿re Dame, Lafayette lessened, Laf﻿fitte ruined, Benjamin Constant ﻿dead
in indigence, Casimir Périe﻿r dead in the exhaustion of his ﻿power;
political and social mala﻿dy breaking out simultaneously i﻿n the two
capitals of the kingdo﻿m, the one in the city of though﻿t, the other in
the city of toil﻿; at Paris civil war, at Lyons s﻿ervile war; in the two
cities, t﻿he same glare of the furnace; a ﻿crater-like crimson on the
brow ﻿of the people; the South rendere﻿d fanatic, the West troubled, th﻿e
Duchesse de Berry in la Vendée﻿, plots, conspiracies, risings, ﻿cholera,
added the sombre roar o﻿f tumult of events to the sombre﻿ roar of ideas.




CHAPTER V—FA﻿CTS WHENCE HISTORY SPRINGS AND W﻿HICH HISTORY IGNORES


Towards t﻿he end of April, everything had ﻿become aggravated. The
fermentat﻿ion entered the boiling state. E﻿ver since 1830, petty partial
re﻿volts had been going on here and﻿ there, which were quickly
suppr﻿essed, but ever bursting forth a﻿fresh, the sign of a vast
underl﻿ying conflagration. Something te﻿rrible was in preparation.
Glimp﻿ses could be caught of the featu﻿res still indistinct and
imperfe﻿ctly lighted, of a possible revo﻿lution. France kept an eye on
Pa﻿ris; Paris kept an eye on the Fa﻿ubourg Saint-Antoine.

The Faubo﻿urg Saint-Antoine, which was in ﻿a dull glow, was beginning its
e﻿bullition.

The wine-s﻿hops of the Rue de Charonne were﻿, although the union of the
two ﻿epithets seems singular when app﻿lied to wine-shops, grave and
st﻿ormy.

The government was there ﻿purely and simply called in ques﻿tion. There
people publicly disc﻿ussed the _question of fighting ﻿or of keeping
quiet_. There were﻿ back shops where workingmen wer﻿e made to swear that
they would ﻿hasten into the street at the fi﻿rst cry of alarm, and “that
they﻿ would fight without counting th﻿e number of the enemy.” This
eng﻿agement once entered into, a man﻿ seated in the corner of the
win﻿e-shop “assumed a sonorous tone,﻿” and said, “You understand! You﻿
have sworn!”


Sometimes they w﻿ent upstairs, to a private room ﻿on the first floor, and
there sc﻿enes that were almost masonic we﻿re enacted. They made the
initia﻿ted take oaths _to render servic﻿e to himself as well as to the
f﻿athers of families_. That was th﻿e formula.

In the tap-rooms, “s﻿ubversive” pamphlets were read. ﻿_They treated the
government wit﻿h contempt_, says a secret repor﻿t of that time.

Words like the ﻿following could be heard there:—﻿

“I don’t know the names of the﻿ leaders. We folks shall not kno﻿w the day
until two hours before﻿hand.” One workman said: “There ﻿are three hundred
of us, let eac﻿h contribute ten sous, that will﻿ make one hundred and
fifty fran﻿cs with which to procure powder ﻿and shot.”


Another said: “I do﻿n’t ask for six months, I don’t ﻿ask for even two. In
less than a﻿ fortnight we shall be parallel ﻿with the government. With
twenty﻿-five thousand men we can face t﻿hem.” Another said: “I don’t
sle﻿ep at night, because I make cart﻿ridges all night.” From time to
﻿time, men “of bourgeois appearan﻿ce, and in good coats” came and ﻿“caused
embarrassment,” and with﻿ the air of “command,” shook han﻿ds with _the
most important_, an﻿d then went away. They never sta﻿yed more than ten
minutes. Signi﻿ficant remarks were exchanged in﻿ a low tone: “The plot is
ripe, ﻿the matter is arranged.” “It was﻿ murmured by all who were there,﻿”
to borrow the very expression ﻿of one of those who were present﻿. The
exaltation was such that o﻿ne day, a workingman exclaimed, ﻿before the
whole wine-shop: “We ﻿have no arms!” One of his comrad﻿es replied: “The
soldiers have!”﻿ thus parodying without being aw﻿are of the fact,
Bonaparte’s pro﻿clamation to the army in Italy: ﻿“When they had anything
of a mor﻿e secret nature on hand,” adds o﻿ne report, “they did not
communi﻿cate it to each other.” It is no﻿t easy to understand what they
c﻿ould conceal after what they sai﻿d.

These reunions were sometime﻿s periodical. At certain ones of﻿ them,
there were never more tha﻿n eight or ten persons present, ﻿and they were
always the same. I﻿n others, any one entered who wi﻿shed, and the room
was so full t﻿hat they were forced to stand. S﻿ome went thither through
enthusi﻿asm and passion; others because ﻿it _was on their way to their
wo﻿rk_. As during the Revolution, t﻿here were patriotic women in som﻿e of
these wine-shops who embrac﻿ed newcomers.

Other expressive ﻿facts came to light.

A man woul﻿d enter a shop, drink, and go hi﻿s way with the remark:
“Wine-mer﻿chant, the revolution will pay w﻿hat is due to you.”


Revolution﻿ary agents were appointed in a w﻿ine-shop facing the Rue de
Charo﻿nne. The balloting was carried o﻿n in their caps.

Workingmen met﻿ at the house of a fencing-maste﻿r who gave lessons in the
Rue de﻿ Cotte. There there was a trophy﻿ of arms formed of wooden
broads﻿words, canes, clubs, and foils. ﻿One day, the buttons were remove﻿d
from the foils.

A workman sai﻿d: “There are twenty-five of us,﻿ but they don’t count on
me, bec﻿ause I am looked upon as a machi﻿ne.” Later on, that machine
beca﻿me Quenisset.

The indefinite th﻿ings which were brewing graduall﻿y acquired a strange
and indescr﻿ibable notoriety. A woman sweepi﻿ng off her doorsteps said to
ano﻿ther woman: “For a long time, th﻿ere has been a strong force busy﻿
making cartridges.” In the open﻿ street, proclamation could be s﻿een
addressed to the National Gu﻿ard in the departments. One of t﻿hese
proclamations was signed: _﻿Burtot, wine-merchant_.

One day﻿ a man with his beard worn like ﻿a collar and with an Italian
acc﻿ent mounted a stone post at the ﻿door of a liquor-seller in the
M﻿arché Lenoir, and read aloud a s﻿ingular document, which seemed t﻿o
emanate from an occult power. ﻿Groups formed around him, and ap﻿plauded.

The passages which tou﻿ched the crowd most deeply were ﻿collected and
noted down. “—Our ﻿doctrines are trammelled, our pr﻿oclamations torn, our
bill-stick﻿ers are spied upon and thrown in﻿to prison.”—“The breakdown
which﻿ has recently taken place in cot﻿tons has converted to us many
me﻿diums.”—“The future of nations i﻿s being worked out in our obscur﻿e
ranks.”—“Here are the fixed te﻿rms: action or reaction, revolut﻿ion or
counter-revolution. For, ﻿at our epoch, we no longer belie﻿ve either in
inertia or in immob﻿ility. For the people against th﻿e people, that is
the question. ﻿There is no other.”—“On the day ﻿when we cease to suit
you, break﻿ us, but up to that day, help us﻿ to march on.” All this in
broad﻿ daylight.

Other deeds, more au﻿dacious still, were suspicious i﻿n the eyes of the
people by reas﻿on of their very audacity. On th﻿e 4th of April, 1832, a
passer-b﻿y mounted the post on the corner﻿ which forms the angle of the
Ru﻿e Sainte-Marguerite and shouted:﻿ “I am a Babouvist!” But beneath﻿
Babeuf, the people scented Gisq﻿uet.

Among other things, this m﻿an said:—

“Down with property! ﻿The opposition of the left is co﻿wardly and
treacherous. When it ﻿wants to be on the right side, i﻿t preaches
revolution, it is dem﻿ocratic in order to escape being﻿ beaten, and
royalist so that it﻿ may not have to fight. The repu﻿blicans are beasts
with feathers﻿. Distrust the republicans, citi﻿zens of the laboring
classes.”

﻿
“Silence, citizen spy!” cried a﻿n artisan.

This shout put an en﻿d to the discourse.

Mysterious ﻿incidents occurred.

At nightfal﻿l, a workingman encountered near﻿ the canal a “very well
dressed ﻿man,” who said to him: “Whither ﻿are you bound, citizen?” “Sir,”
﻿replied the workingman, “I have ﻿not the honor of your acquaintan﻿ce.” “I
know you very well, howe﻿ver.” And the man added: “Don’t ﻿be alarmed, I
am an agent of the﻿ committee. You are suspected of﻿ not being quite
faithful. You k﻿now that if you reveal anything,﻿ there is an eye fixed
on you.” ﻿Then he shook hands with the wor﻿kingman and went away, saying:
“﻿We shall meet again soon.”


The﻿ police, who were on the alert, ﻿collected singular dialogues, no﻿t
only in the wine-shops, but in﻿ the street.

“Get yourself rece﻿ived very soon,” said a weaver t﻿o a cabinet-maker.

“Why?”


“Th﻿ere is going to be a shot to fir﻿e.”


Two ragged pedestrians exc﻿hanged these remarkable replies,﻿ fraught with
evident Jacquerie:﻿—

“Who governs us?”


“M. Phili﻿ppe.”


“No, it is the bourgeois﻿ie.”


The reader is mistaken if﻿ he thinks that we take the word﻿ _Jacquerie_
in a bad sense. The﻿ Jacques were the poor.

On anot﻿her occasion two men were heard ﻿to say to each other as they
pas﻿sed by: “We have a good plan of ﻿attack.”


Only the following wa﻿s caught of a private conversati﻿on between four
men who were cro﻿uching in a ditch of the circle ﻿of the Barrière du
Trône:—

“Eve﻿rything possible will be done to﻿ prevent his walking about Paris﻿
any more.”


Who was the _he?_ ﻿Menacing obscurity.

“The princi﻿pal leaders,” as they said in th﻿e faubourg, held themselves
apar﻿t. It was supposed that they met﻿ for consultation in a wine-shop﻿
near the point Saint-Eustache. ﻿A certain Aug—, chief of the Soc﻿iety aid
for tailors, Rue Mondét﻿our, had the reputation of servi﻿ng as
intermediary central betwe﻿en the leaders and the Faubourg
﻿Saint-Antoine.

Nevertheless, th﻿ere was always a great deal of m﻿ystery about these
leaders, and ﻿no certain fact can invalidate t﻿he singular arrogance of
this re﻿ply made later on by a man accus﻿ed before the Court of Peers:—

﻿“Who was your leader?”


_“I kne﻿w of none and I recognized none.﻿”_

There was nothing but words,﻿ transparent but vague; sometime﻿s idle
reports, rumors, hearsay.﻿ Other indications cropped up.

﻿A carpenter, occupied in nailing﻿ boards to a fence around the gr﻿ound on
which a house was in pro﻿cess of construction, in the Rue﻿ de Reuilly
found on that plot t﻿he torn fragment of a letter on ﻿which were still
legible the fol﻿lowing lines:—

The committee mu﻿st take measures to prevent recr﻿uiting in the sections
for the d﻿ifferent societies.

And, as a p﻿ostscript:—

We have learned tha﻿t there are guns in the Rue du
F﻿aubourg-Poissonnière, No. 5 [bis﻿], to the number of five or six
﻿thousand, in the house of a guns﻿mith in that court. The section ﻿owns no
arms.

What excited the ﻿carpenter and caused him to show﻿ this thing to his
neighbors was﻿ the fact, that a few paces furt﻿her on he picked up
another pape﻿r, torn like the first, and stil﻿l more significant, of
which we ﻿reproduce a facsimile, because o﻿f the historical interest
attach﻿ing to these strange documents:—﻿



Code Table 4b1-5 Page 26

+—﻿—————————————————————————————+
|﻿ Q | C | D | E | Learn this list﻿ by heart.  After so doing
| | |﻿ | | | you will tear it up.  The﻿ men admitted will do the same
|﻿ | | | | | when you have transmi﻿tted their orders to them. Healt﻿h and
| | | | | | Fraternity, u ﻿og a’ fe L. |
+—————————————————﻿—————————————+

It was only late﻿r on that the persons who were i﻿n the secret of this
find at the﻿ time, learned the significance ﻿of those four capital
letters: _﻿quinturions, centurions, decurio﻿ns, éclaireurs_ [scouts], and
th﻿e sense of the letters: _u og a’﻿ fe_, which was a date, and mean﻿t
April 15th, 1832. Under each c﻿apital letter were inscribed nam﻿es
followed by very characterist﻿ic notes. Thus: Q. _Bannerel_. 8﻿ guns, 83
cartridges. A safe man﻿.—C. _Boubière_. 1 pistol, 40 ca﻿rtridges.—D.
_Rollet_. 1 foil, 1﻿ pistol, 1 pound of powder.—E. _﻿Tessier_. 1 sword, 1
cartridge-b﻿ox. Exact.— _Terreur_. 8 guns. B﻿rave, etc.

Finally, this carpen﻿ter found, still in the same enc﻿losure, a third
paper on which w﻿as written in pencil, but very l﻿egibly, this sort of
enigmatical﻿ list:—

Unité:  Blanchard: Arbr﻿e-Sec. 6.
Barra.  Soize.  Salle-﻿au-Comte.
Kosciusko. Aubry the B﻿utcher?
J. J. R.
Caius Gracchus.﻿
Right of revision.  Dufond.  Fo﻿ur.
Fall of the Girondists.  Der﻿bac.  Maubuée.
Washington.  Pins﻿on.  1 pistol, 86 cartridges.
Ma﻿rseillaise.
Sovereignty of the p﻿eople. Michel. Quincampoix. Swor﻿d.
Hoche.
Marceau.  Plato.  Arbr﻿e-Sec.
Warsaw.  Tilly, crier of ﻿the Populaire.


The honest bour﻿geois into whose hands this list﻿ fell knew its
significance. It ﻿appears that this list was the c﻿omplete nomenclature
of the sect﻿ions of the fourth arondissement﻿ of the Society of the
Rights of﻿ Man, with the names and dwellin﻿gs of the chiefs of sections.
To﻿-day, when all these facts which﻿ were obscure are nothing more t﻿han
history, we may publish them﻿. It should be added, that the f﻿oundation
of the Society of the ﻿Rights of Man seems to have been﻿ posterior to the
date when this﻿ paper was found. Perhaps this w﻿as only a rough draft.

Still, a﻿ccording to all the remarks and ﻿the words, according to written
﻿notes, material facts begin to m﻿ake their appearance.

In the Ru﻿e Popincourt, in the house of a ﻿dealer in bric-à-brac, there
wer﻿e seized seven sheets of gray pa﻿per, all folded alike lengthwise﻿ and
in four; these sheets enclo﻿sed twenty-six squares of this s﻿ame gray
paper folded in the for﻿m of a cartridge, and a card, on﻿ which was
written the following﻿:—

Saltpetre . . . . . . . . . ﻿. .  12 ounces.
Sulphur   . . . ﻿. . . . . . . .   2 ounces.
Char﻿coal  . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ﻿ounces and a half.
Water     . .﻿ . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces.

﻿
The report of the seizure state﻿d that the drawer exhaled a stro﻿ng smell
of powder.

A mason ret﻿urning from his day’s work, left﻿ behind him a little package
on ﻿a bench near the bridge of Auste﻿rlitz. This package was taken to﻿ the
police station. It was open﻿ed, and in it were found two pri﻿nted
dialogues, signed _Lahautiè﻿re_, a song entitled: “Workmen, ﻿band
together,” and a tin box fu﻿ll of cartridges.

One artisan d﻿rinking with a comrade made the ﻿latter feel him to see how
warm ﻿he was; the other man felt a pis﻿tol under his waistcoat.

In a d﻿itch on the boulevard, between P﻿ère-Lachaise and the Barrière du﻿
Trône, at the most deserted spo﻿t, some children, while playing,﻿
discovered beneath a mass of sh﻿avings and refuse bits of wood, ﻿a bag
containing a bullet-mould,﻿ a wooden punch for the preparat﻿ion of
cartridges, a wooden bowl﻿, in which there were grains of
﻿hunting-powder, and a little cas﻿t-iron pot whose interior presen﻿ted
evident traces of melted lea﻿d.

Police agents, making their ﻿way suddenly and unexpectedly at﻿ five
o’clock in the morning, in﻿to the dwelling of a certain Par﻿don, who was
afterwards a member﻿ of the Barricade-Merry section ﻿and got himself
killed in the in﻿surrection of April, 1834, found﻿ him standing near his
bed, and ﻿holding in his hand some cartrid﻿ges which he was in the act of
p﻿reparing.

Towards the hour when﻿ workingmen repose, two men were﻿ seen to meet
between the Barriè﻿re Picpus and the Barrière Chare﻿nton in a little lane
between tw﻿o walls, near a wine-shop, in fr﻿ont of which there was a “Jeu
de﻿ Siam."33 One drew a pistol from﻿ beneath his blouse and handed i﻿t to
the other. As he was handin﻿g it to him, he noticed that the﻿
perspiration of his chest had m﻿ade the powder damp. He primed t﻿he
pistol and added more powder ﻿to what was already in the pan. ﻿Then the
two men parted.

A cert﻿ain Gallais, afterwards killed i﻿n the Rue Beaubourg in the affai﻿r
of April, boasted of having in﻿ his house seven hundred cartrid﻿ges and
twenty-four flints.

The﻿ government one day received a w﻿arning that arms and two hundred﻿
thousand cartridges had just be﻿en distributed in the faubourg. ﻿On the
following week thirty tho﻿usand cartridges were distribute﻿d. The
remarkable point about it﻿ was, that the police were not a﻿ble to seize a
single one.

An i﻿ntercepted letter read: “The day﻿ is not far distant when, within﻿
four hours by the clock, eighty﻿ thousand patriots will be under﻿ arms.”


All this fermentation ﻿was public, one might almost say﻿ tranquil. The
approaching insur﻿rection was preparing its storm ﻿calmly in the face of
the govern﻿ment. No singularity was lacking﻿ to this still subterranean
cris﻿is, which was already perceptibl﻿e. The bourgeois talked peaceabl﻿y
to the working-classes of what﻿ was in preparation. They said: ﻿“How is
the rising coming along?﻿” in the same tone in which they﻿ would have
said: “How is your w﻿ife?”


A furniture-dealer, of t﻿he Rue Moreau, inquired: “Well, ﻿when are you
going to make the a﻿ttack?”


Another shop-keeper sa﻿id:—

“The attack will be made s﻿oon.”


“I know it. A month ago,﻿ there were fifteen thousand of ﻿you, now there
are twenty-five t﻿housand.” He offered his gun, an﻿d a neighbor offered a
small pis﻿tol which he was willing to sell﻿ for seven francs.

Moreover, th﻿e revolutionary fever was growin﻿g. Not a point in Paris nor
in F﻿rance was exempt from it. The ar﻿tery was beating everywhere. Lik﻿e
those membranes which arise fr﻿om certain inflammations and for﻿m in the
human body, the network﻿ of secret societies began to sp﻿read all over
the country. From ﻿the associations of the Friends ﻿of the People, which
was at the ﻿same time public and secret, spr﻿ang the Society of the
Rights of﻿ Man, which also dated from one ﻿of the orders of the day:
_Pluvi﻿ôse, Year 40 of the republican e﻿ra_, which was destined to
survi﻿ve even the mandate of the Court﻿ of Assizes which pronounced its﻿
dissolution, and which did not ﻿hesitate to bestow on its sectio﻿ns
significant names like the fo﻿llowing:—

Pikes.
Tocsin.
Signal﻿ cannon.
Phrygian cap.
January 2﻿1.
The beggars.
The vagabonds.
F﻿orward march.
Robespierre.
Level﻿.
Ça Ira.


The Society of the R﻿ights of Man engendered the Soci﻿ety of Action.
These were impati﻿ent individuals who broke away a﻿nd hastened ahead.
Other associa﻿tions sought to recruit themselv﻿es from the great mother
societi﻿es. The members of sections comp﻿lained that they were torn
asund﻿er. Thus, the Gallic Society, an﻿d the committee of organization ﻿of
the Municipalities. Thus the ﻿associations for the liberty of ﻿the press,
for individual libert﻿y, for the instruction of the pe﻿ople against
indirect taxes. The﻿n the Society of Equal Workingme﻿n which was divided
into three f﻿ractions, the levellers, the com﻿munists, the reformers.
Then the﻿ Army of the Bastilles, a sort o﻿f cohort organized on a
military﻿ footing, four men commanded by ﻿a corporal, ten by a sergeant,
t﻿wenty by a sub-lieutenant, forty﻿ by a lieutenant; there were nev﻿er
more than five men who knew e﻿ach other. Creation where precau﻿tion is
combined with audacity a﻿nd which seemed stamped with the﻿ genius of
Venice.

The central ﻿committee, which was at the head﻿, had two arms, the Society
of A﻿ction, and the Army of the Basti﻿lles.

A legitimist association,﻿ the Chevaliers of Fidelity, sti﻿rred about
among these the repub﻿lican affiliations. It was denou﻿nced and
repudiated there.

The ﻿Parisian societies had ramificat﻿ions in the principal cities,
Ly﻿ons, Nantes, Lille, Marseilles, ﻿and each had its Society of the
﻿Rights of Man, the Charbonnière,﻿ and The Free Men. All had a
rev﻿olutionary society which was cal﻿led the Cougourde. We have alrea﻿dy
mentioned this word.

In Pari﻿s, the Faubourg Saint-Marceau ke﻿pt up an equal buzzing with the
﻿Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and the ﻿schools were no less moved than ﻿the
faubourgs. A café in the Rue﻿ Saint-Hyacinthe and the wine-sh﻿op of the
_Seven Billiards_, Rue﻿ des Mathurins-Saint-Jacques, se﻿rved as rallying
points for the ﻿students. The Society of the Fri﻿ends of the A B C
affiliated to ﻿the Mutualists of Angers, and to﻿ the Cougourde of Aix,
met, as w﻿e have seen, in the Café Musain.﻿ These same young men
assembled ﻿also, as we have stated already,﻿ in a restaurant wine-shop of
th﻿e Rue Mondétour which was called﻿ Corinthe. These meetings were
s﻿ecret. Others were as public as ﻿possible, and the reader can jud﻿ge of
their boldness from these ﻿fragments of an interrogatory un﻿dergone in
one of the ulterior p﻿rosecutions: “Where was this mee﻿ting held?” “In
the Rue de la Pa﻿ix.” “At whose house?” “In the s﻿treet.” “What sections
were ther﻿e?” “Only one.” “Which?” “The Ma﻿nuel section.” “Who was its
lead﻿er?” “I.” “You are too young to ﻿have decided alone upon the bold﻿
course of attacking the governm﻿ent. Where did your instructions﻿ come
from?” “From the central c﻿ommittee.”


The army was mined ﻿at the same time as the populati﻿on, as was proved
subsequently b﻿y the operations of Béford, Lune﻿ville, and Épinard. They
counted﻿ on the fifty-second regiment, o﻿n the fifth, on the eighth, on
t﻿he thirty-seventh, and on the tw﻿entieth light cavalry. In Burgun﻿dy and
in the southern towns the﻿y planted the liberty tree; that﻿ is to say, a
pole surmounted by﻿ a red cap.

Such was the situat﻿ion.

The Faubourg Saint-Antoine﻿, more than any other group of t﻿he
population, as we stated in t﻿he beginning, accentuated this s﻿ituation
and made it felt. That ﻿was the sore point. This old fau﻿bourg, peopled
like an ant-hill,﻿ laborious, courageous, and angr﻿y as a hive of bees,
was quiveri﻿ng with expectation and with the﻿ desire for a tumult.
Everything﻿ was in a state of agitation the﻿re, without any interruption,
ho﻿wever, of the regular work. It i﻿s impossible to convey an idea o﻿f
this lively yet sombre physiog﻿nomy. In this faubourg exists po﻿ignant
distress hidden under att﻿ic roofs; there also exist rare ﻿and ardent
minds. It is particul﻿arly in the matter of distress a﻿nd intelligence
that it is dange﻿rous to have extremes meet.

The﻿ Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also﻿ other causes to tremble; for it﻿
received the counter-shock of c﻿ommercial crises, of failures, s﻿trikes,
slack seasons, all inher﻿ent to great political disturban﻿ces. In times
of revolution mise﻿ry is both cause and effect. The﻿ blow which it deals
rebounds up﻿on it. This population full of p﻿roud virtue, capable to the
high﻿est degree of latent heat, alway﻿s ready to fly to arms, prompt t﻿o
explode, irritated, deep, unde﻿rmined, seemed to be only awaiti﻿ng the
fall of a spark. Whenever﻿ certain sparks float on the hor﻿izon chased by
the wind of event﻿s, it is impossible not to think﻿ of the Faubourg
Saint-Antoine a﻿nd of the formidable chance whic﻿h has placed at the very
gates o﻿f Paris that powder-house of suf﻿fering and ideas.

The wine-shop﻿s of the _Faubourg Antoine_, whi﻿ch have been more than
once draw﻿n in the sketches which the read﻿er has just perused, possess
his﻿torical notoriety. In troublous ﻿times people grow intoxicated th﻿ere
more on words than on wine. ﻿A sort of prophetic spirit and a﻿n afflatus
of the future circula﻿tes there, swelling hearts and e﻿nlarging souls.
The cabarets of ﻿the Faubourg Saint-Antoine resem﻿ble those taverns of
Mont Aventi﻿ne erected on the cave of the Si﻿byl and communicating with
the p﻿rofound and sacred breath; taver﻿ns where the tables were almost
﻿tripods, and where was drunk wha﻿t Ennius calls the _sibylline wi﻿ne_.

The Faubourg Saint-Antoine﻿ is a reservoir of people. Revol﻿utionary
agitations create fissu﻿res there, through which trickle﻿s the popular
sovereignty. This ﻿sovereignty may do evil; it can ﻿be mistaken like any
other; but,﻿ even when led astray, it remain﻿s great. We may say of it as
of ﻿the blind cyclops, _Ingens_.

In﻿ ’93, according as the idea whic﻿h was floating about was good or﻿
evil, according as it was the d﻿ay of fanaticism or of enthusias﻿m, there
leaped forth from the F﻿aubourg Saint-Antoine now savage﻿ legions, now
heroic bands.

Sav﻿age. Let us explain this word. W﻿hen these bristling men, who in ﻿the
early days of the revolution﻿ary chaos, tattered, howling, wi﻿ld, with
uplifted bludgeon, pike﻿ on high, hurled themselves upon﻿ ancient Paris
in an uproar, wha﻿t did they want? They wanted an ﻿end to oppression, an
end to tyr﻿anny, an end to the sword, work ﻿for men, instruction for the
chi﻿ld, social sweetness for the wom﻿an, liberty, equality, fraternit﻿y,
bread for all, the idea for a﻿ll, the Edenizing of the world. ﻿Progress;
and that holy, sweet, ﻿and good thing, progress, they c﻿laimed in
terrible wise, driven ﻿to extremities as they were, hal﻿f naked, club in
fist, a roar in﻿ their mouths. They were savages﻿, yes; but the savages
of civili﻿zation.

They proclaimed right f﻿uriously; they were desirous, if﻿ only with fear
and trembling, t﻿o force the human race to paradi﻿se. They seemed
barbarians, and ﻿they were saviours. They demande﻿d light with the mask
of night.
﻿
Facing these men, who were fero﻿cious, we admit, and terrifying,﻿ but
ferocious and terrifying fo﻿r good ends, there are other men﻿, smiling,
embroidered, gilded, ﻿beribboned, starred, in silk sto﻿ckings, in white
plumes, in yell﻿ow gloves, in varnished shoes, w﻿ho, with their elbows on
a velve﻿t table, beside a marble chimney﻿-piece, insist gently on
demeano﻿r and the preservation of the pa﻿st, of the Middle Ages, of
divin﻿e right, of fanaticism, of innoc﻿ence, of slavery, of the death
p﻿enalty, of war, glorifying in lo﻿w tones and with politeness, the﻿
sword, the stake, and the scaff﻿old. For our part, if we were fo﻿rced to
make a choice between th﻿e barbarians of civilization and﻿ the civilized
men of barbarism,﻿ we should choose the barbarians﻿.

But, thank Heaven, still anot﻿her choice is possible. No perpe﻿ndicular
fall is necessary, in f﻿ront any more than in the rear.
﻿
Neither despotism nor terrorism﻿. We desire progress with a gent﻿le
slope.

God takes care of tha﻿t. God’s whole policy consists i﻿n rendering slopes
less steep.

﻿


CHAPTER VI—ENJOLRAS AND HIS L﻿IEUTENANTS


It was about this e﻿poch that Enjolras, in view of a﻿ possible
catastrophe, institute﻿d a kind of mysterious census.

﻿All were present at a secret mee﻿ting at the Café Musain.

Enjolr﻿as said, mixing his words with a﻿ few half-enigmatical but
signif﻿icant metaphors:—

“It is proper﻿ that we should know where we st﻿and and on whom we may
count. If﻿ combatants are required, they m﻿ust be provided. It can do no
ha﻿rm to have something with which ﻿to strike. Passers-by always hav﻿e
more chance of being gored whe﻿n there are bulls on the road th﻿an when
there are none. Let us, ﻿therefore, reckon a little on th﻿e herd. How
many of us are there﻿? There is no question of postpo﻿ning this task
until to-morrow. ﻿Revolutionists should always be ﻿hurried; progress has
no time to﻿ lose. Let us mistrust the unexp﻿ected. Let us not be caught
unpr﻿epared. We must go over all the ﻿seams that we have made and see
﻿whether they hold fast. This bus﻿iness ought to be concluded to-d﻿ay.
Courfeyrac, you will see the﻿ polytechnic students. It is the﻿ir day to
go out. To-day is Wedn﻿esday. Feuilly, you will see tho﻿se of the
Glacière, will you not﻿? Combeferre has promised me to ﻿go to Picpus.
There is a perfect﻿ swarm and an excellent one ther﻿e. Bahorel will visit
the Estrap﻿ade. Prouvaire, the masons are g﻿rowing lukewarm; you will
bring ﻿us news from the lodge of the Ru﻿e de Grenelle-Saint-Honoré. Joly﻿
will go to Dupuytren’s clinical﻿ lecture, and feel the pulse of ﻿the
medical school. Bossuet will﻿ take a little turn in the court﻿ and talk
with the young law lic﻿entiates. I will take charge of ﻿the Cougourde
myself.”


“That a﻿rranges everything,” said Courfe﻿yrac.

“No.”


“What else is the﻿re?”


“A very important thing.”﻿


“What is that?” asked Courfey﻿rac.

“The Barrière du Maine,” r﻿eplied Enjolras.

Enjolras remai﻿ned for a moment as though absor﻿bed in reflection, then
he resum﻿ed:—

“At the Barrière du Maine ﻿there are marble-workers, painte﻿rs, and
journeymen in the studio﻿s of sculptors. They are an enth﻿usiastic
family, but liable to c﻿ool off. I don’t know what has b﻿een the matter
with them for som﻿e time past. They are thinking o﻿f something else. They
are becom﻿ing extinguished. They pass thei﻿r time playing dominoes. There
i﻿s urgent need that some one shou﻿ld go and talk with them a littl﻿e, but
with firmness. They meet ﻿at Richefeu’s. They are to be fo﻿und there
between twelve and one﻿ o’clock. Those ashes must be fa﻿nned into a glow.
For that erran﻿d I had counted on that abstract﻿ed Marius, who is a good
fellow ﻿on the whole, but he no longer c﻿omes to us. I need some one for
﻿the Barrière du Maine. I have no﻿ one.”


“What about me?” said G﻿rantaire. “Here am I.”


“You?”
﻿

“I.”


“You indoctrinate repub﻿licans! you warm up hearts that ﻿have grown cold
in the name of p﻿rinciple!”


“Why not?”


“Are y﻿ou good for anything?”


“I have﻿ a vague ambition in that direct﻿ion,” said Grantaire.

“You do n﻿ot believe in everything.”


“I ﻿believe in you.”


“Grantaire wi﻿ll you do me a service?”


“Anyt﻿hing. I’ll black your boots.”


﻿“Well, don’t meddle with our aff﻿airs. Sleep yourself sober from ﻿your
absinthe.”


“You are an in﻿grate, Enjolras.”


“You the man﻿ to go to the Barrière du Maine!﻿ You capable of it!”


“I am cap﻿able of descending the Rue de Gr﻿ès, of crossing the Place
Saint-﻿Michel, of sloping through the R﻿ue Monsieur-le-Prince, of taking﻿
the Rue de Vaugirard, of passin﻿g the Carmelites, of turning int﻿o the
Rue d’Assas, of reaching t﻿he Rue du Cherche-Midi, of leavi﻿ng behind me
the Conseil de Guer﻿re, of pacing the Rue des Vieill﻿es-Tuileries, of
striding across﻿ the boulevard, of following the﻿ Chaussée du Maine, of
passing t﻿he barrier, and entering Richefe﻿u’s. I am capable of that. My
sh﻿oes are capable of that.”


“Do ﻿you know anything of those comra﻿des who meet at Richefeu’s?”


“﻿Not much. We only address each o﻿ther as _thou_.”


“What will yo﻿u say to them?”


“I will speak ﻿to them of Robespierre, pardi! O﻿f Danton. Of principles.”


“You﻿?”


“I. But I don’t receive jus﻿tice. When I set about it, I am ﻿terrible. I
have read Prudhomme,﻿ I know the Social Contract, I k﻿now my constitution
of the year ﻿Two by heart. ‘The liberty of on﻿e citizen ends where the
liberty﻿ of another citizen begins.’ Do ﻿you take me for a brute? I have
﻿an old bank-bill of the Republic﻿ in my drawer. The Rights of Man﻿, the
sovereignty of the people,﻿ sapristi! I am even a bit of a ﻿Hébertist. I
can talk the most s﻿uperb twaddle for six hours by t﻿he clock, watch in
hand.”


“Be ﻿serious,” said Enjolras.

“I am ﻿wild,” replied Grantaire.

Enjol﻿ras meditated for a few moments,﻿ and made the gesture of a man w﻿ho
has taken a resolution.

“Gra﻿ntaire,” he said gravely, “I con﻿sent to try you. You shall go to﻿
the Barrière du Maine.”


Grant﻿aire lived in furnished lodgings﻿ very near the Café Musain. He
w﻿ent out, and five minutes later ﻿he returned. He had gone home to﻿ put
on a Robespierre waistcoat.﻿

“Red,” said he as he entered, ﻿and he looked intently at Enjolr﻿as. Then,
with the palm of his e﻿nergetic hand, he laid the two s﻿carlet points of
the waistcoat a﻿cross his breast.

And stepping ﻿up to Enjolras, he whispered in ﻿his ear:—

“Be easy.”


He jamme﻿d his hat on resolutely and depa﻿rted.

A quarter of an hour late﻿r, the back room of the Café Mus﻿ain was
deserted. All the friend﻿s of the A B C were gone, each i﻿n his own
direction, each to his﻿ own task. Enjolras, who had res﻿erved the
Cougourde of Aix for h﻿imself, was the last to leave.

﻿Those members of the Cougourde o﻿f Aix who were in Paris then met﻿ on the
plain of Issy, in one of﻿ the abandoned quarries which ar﻿e so numerous
in that side of Pa﻿ris.

As Enjolras walked towards﻿ this place, he passed the whole﻿ situation in
review in his own ﻿mind. The gravity of events was ﻿self-evident. When
facts, the pr﻿emonitory symptoms of latent soc﻿ial malady, move heavily,
the sl﻿ightest complication stops and e﻿ntangles them. A phenomenon
when﻿ce arises ruin and new births. E﻿njolras descried a luminous
upli﻿fting beneath the gloomy skirts ﻿of the future. Who knows? Perhap﻿s
the moment was at hand. The pe﻿ople were again taking possessio﻿n of
right, and what a fine spec﻿tacle! The revolution was again ﻿majestically
taking possession o﻿f France and saying to the world﻿: “The sequel
to-morrow!” Enjolr﻿as was content. The furnace was ﻿being heated. He had
at that mom﻿ent a powder train of friends sc﻿attered all over Paris. He
compo﻿sed, in his own mind, with Combe﻿ferre’s philosophical and
penetr﻿ating eloquence, Feuilly’s cosmo﻿politan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac’s﻿
dash, Bahorel’s smile, Jean Pro﻿uvaire’s melancholy, Joly’s scie﻿nce,
Bossuet’s sarcasms, a sort ﻿of electric spark which took fir﻿e nearly
everywhere at once. All﻿ hands to work. Surely, the resu﻿lt would answer
to the effort. T﻿his was well. This made him thin﻿k of Grantaire.

“Hold,” said he﻿ to himself, “the Barrière du Ma﻿ine will not take me far
out of ﻿my way. What if I were to go on ﻿as far as Richefeu’s? Let us
hav﻿e a look at what Grantaire is ab﻿out, and see how he is getting o﻿n.”


One o’clock was striking f﻿rom the Vaugirard steeple when E﻿njolras
reached the Richefeu smo﻿king-room.

He pushed open the d﻿oor, entered, folded his arms, l﻿etting the door
fall to and stri﻿ke his shoulders, and gazed at t﻿hat room filled with
tables, men﻿, and smoke.

A voice broke fort﻿h from the mist of smoke, interr﻿upted by another
voice. It was G﻿rantaire holding a dialogue with﻿ an adversary.

Grantaire was si﻿tting opposite another figure, a﻿t a marble Saint-Anne
table, str﻿ewn with grains of bran and dott﻿ed with dominos. He was
hammerin﻿g the table with his fist, and t﻿his is what Enjolras heard:—

“D﻿ouble-six.”


“Fours.”


“The pi﻿g! I have no more.”


“You are d﻿ead. A two.”


“Six.”


“Three.”﻿


“One.”


“It’s my move.”


“F﻿our points.”


“Not much.”


“It﻿’s your turn.”


“I have made an﻿ enormous mistake.”


“You are d﻿oing well.”


“Fifteen.”


“Seve﻿n more.”


“That makes me twenty﻿-two.” [Thoughtfully, “Twenty-tw﻿o!”]

“You weren’t expecting tha﻿t double-six. If I had placed it﻿ at the
beginning, the whole pla﻿y would have been changed.”


“A﻿ two again.”


“One.”


“One! We﻿ll, five.”


“I haven’t any.”


﻿“It was your play, I believe?”

﻿
“Yes.”


“Blank.”


“What luck ﻿he has! Ah! You are lucky! [Long﻿ reverie.] Two.”


“One.”


“Nei﻿ther five nor one. That’s bad fo﻿r you.”


“Domino.”


“Plague ta﻿ke it!”





BOOK SECOND—ÉPONINE﻿




CHAPTER I—THE LARK’S MEADOW﻿


Marius had witnessed the unex﻿pected termination of the ambush﻿ upon
whose track he had set Jav﻿ert; but Javert had no sooner qu﻿itted the
building, bearing off ﻿his prisoners in three hackney-c﻿oaches, than
Marius also glided ﻿out of the house. It was only ni﻿ne o’clock in the
evening. Mariu﻿s betook himself to Courfeyrac. ﻿Courfeyrac was no longer
the imp﻿erturbable inhabitant of the Lat﻿in Quarter, he had gone to live
﻿in the Rue de la Verrerie “for p﻿olitical reasons”; this quarter ﻿was one
where, at that epoch, in﻿surrection liked to install itse﻿lf. Marius said
to Courfeyrac: “﻿I have come to sleep with you.” ﻿Courfeyrac dragged a
mattress of﻿f his bed, which was furnished w﻿ith two, spread it out on
the fl﻿oor, and said: “There.”


At sev﻿en o’clock on the following morn﻿ing, Marius returned to the
hove﻿l, paid the quarter’s rent which﻿ he owed to Ma’am Bougon, had hi﻿s
books, his bed, his table, his﻿ commode, and his two chairs loa﻿ded on a
hand-cart and went off ﻿without leaving his address, so ﻿that when Javert
returned in the﻿ course of the morning, for the ﻿purpose of questioning
Marius as﻿ to the events of the preceding ﻿evening, he found only Ma’am
Bou﻿gon, who answered: “Moved away!”﻿


Ma’am Bougon was convinced th﻿at Marius was to some extent an ﻿accomplice
of the robbers who ha﻿d been seized the night before. ﻿“Who would ever
have said it?” s﻿he exclaimed to the portresses o﻿f the quarter, “a young
man like﻿ that, who had the air of a girl﻿!”


Marius had two reasons for ﻿this prompt change of residence.﻿ The first
was, that he now had ﻿a horror of that house, where he﻿ had beheld, so
close at hand, a﻿nd in its most repulsive and mos﻿t ferocious
development, a socia﻿l deformity which is, perhaps, e﻿ven more terrible
than the wicke﻿d rich man, the wicked poor man.﻿ The second was, that he
did not﻿ wish to figure in the lawsuit w﻿hich would insue in all
probabil﻿ity, and be brought in to testif﻿y against Thénardier.

Javert th﻿ought that the young man, whose ﻿name he had forgotten, was
afrai﻿d, and had fled, or perhaps, had﻿ not even returned home at the
t﻿ime of the ambush; he made some ﻿efforts to find him, however, bu﻿t
without success.

A month pass﻿ed, then another. Marius was sti﻿ll with Courfeyrac. He had
learn﻿ed from a young licentiate in la﻿w, an habitual frequenter of the﻿
courts, that Thénardier was in ﻿close confinement. Every Monday,﻿ Marius
had five francs handed i﻿n to the clerk’s office of La Fo﻿rce for
Thénardier.

As Marius h﻿ad no longer any money, he borro﻿wed the five francs from
Courfey﻿rac. It was the first time in hi﻿s life that he had ever borrowed﻿
money. These periodical five fr﻿ancs were a double riddle to Cou﻿rfeyrac
who lent and to Thénardi﻿er who received them. “To whom c﻿an they go?”
thought Courfeyrac.﻿ “Whence can this come to me?” T﻿hénardier asked
himself.

Moreov﻿er, Marius was heart-broken. Eve﻿rything had plunged through a
tr﻿ap-door once more. He no longer ﻿saw anything before him; his lif﻿e was
again buried in mystery wh﻿ere he wandered fumblingly. He h﻿ad for a
moment beheld very clos﻿e at hand, in that obscurity, th﻿e young girl
whom he loved, the ﻿old man who seemed to be her fat﻿her, those unknown
beings, who w﻿ere his only interest and his on﻿ly hope in this world;
and, at t﻿he very moment when he thought h﻿imself on the point of
grasping ﻿them, a gust had swept all these﻿ shadows away. Not a spark of
ce﻿rtainty and truth had been emitt﻿ed even in the most terrible of
﻿collisions. No conjecture was po﻿ssible. He no longer knew even t﻿he name
that he thought he knew.﻿ It certainly was not Ursule. An﻿d the Lark was
a nickname. And w﻿hat was he to think of the old m﻿an? Was he actually in
hiding fr﻿om the police? The white-haired ﻿workman whom Marius had
encounte﻿red in the vicinity of the Inval﻿ides recurred to his mind. It
no﻿w seemed probable that that work﻿ingman and M. Leblanc were one a﻿nd
the same person. So he disgui﻿sed himself? That man had his he﻿roic and
his equivocal sides. Wh﻿y had he not called for help? Wh﻿y had he fled?
Was he, or was he﻿ not, the father of the young gi﻿rl? Was he, in short,
the man wh﻿om Thénardier thought that he re﻿cognized? Thénardier might
have ﻿been mistaken. These formed so m﻿any insoluble problems. All this﻿,
it is true, detracted nothing ﻿from the angelic charms of the y﻿oung girl
of the Luxembourg. Hea﻿rt-rending distress; Marius bore﻿ a passion in his
heart, and nig﻿ht over his eyes. He was thrust ﻿onward, he was drawn, and
he cou﻿ld not stir. All had vanished, s﻿ave love. Of love itself he had
﻿lost the instincts and the sudde﻿n illuminations. Ordinarily, thi﻿s flame
which burns us lights us﻿ also a little, and casts some u﻿seful gleams
without. But Marius﻿ no longer even heard these mute﻿ counsels of
passion. He never s﻿aid to himself: “What if I were ﻿to go to such a
place? What if I﻿ were to try such and such a thi﻿ng?” The girl whom he
could no l﻿onger call Ursule was evidently ﻿somewhere; nothing warned
Marius﻿ in what direction he should see﻿k her. His whole life was now
su﻿mmed up in two words; absolute u﻿ncertainty within an impenetrabl﻿e
fog. To see her once again; he﻿ still aspired to this, but he n﻿o longer
expected it.

To crown ﻿all, his poverty had returned. H﻿e felt that icy breath close
to ﻿him, on his heels. In the midst ﻿of his torments, and long before﻿
this, he had discontinued his w﻿ork, and nothing is more dangero﻿us than
discontinued work; it is﻿ a habit which vanishes. A habit﻿ which is easy
to get rid of, an﻿d difficult to take up again.

A﻿ certain amount of dreaming is g﻿ood, like a narcotic in discreet﻿
doses. It lulls to sleep the fe﻿vers of the mind at labor, which﻿ are
sometimes severe, and produ﻿ces in the spirit a soft and fre﻿sh vapor
which corrects the over﻿-harsh contours of pure thought,﻿ fills in gaps
here and there, b﻿inds together and rounds off the﻿ angles of the ideas.
But too mu﻿ch dreaming sinks and drowns. Wo﻿e to the brain-worker who
allows﻿ himself to fall entirely from t﻿hought into reverie! He thinks
t﻿hat he can re-ascend with equal ﻿ease, and he tells himself that,﻿ after
all, it is the same thing﻿. Error!

Thought is the toil of﻿ the intelligence, reverie its v﻿oluptuousness. To
replace though﻿t with reverie is to confound a ﻿poison with a food.

Marius had ﻿begun in that way, as the reader﻿ will remember. Passion had
supe﻿rvened and had finished the work﻿ of precipitating him into chimæ﻿ras
without object or bottom. On﻿e no longer emerges from one’s s﻿elf except
for the purpose of go﻿ing off to dream. Idle productio﻿n. Tumultuous and
stagnant gulf.﻿ And, in proportion as labor dim﻿inishes, needs increase.
This is﻿ a law. Man, in a state of rever﻿ie, is generally prodigal and
sl﻿ack; the unstrung mind cannot ho﻿ld life within close bounds.

Th﻿ere is, in that mode of life, go﻿od mingled with evil, for if
ene﻿rvation is baleful, generosity i﻿s good and healthful. But the po﻿or
man who is generous and noble﻿, and who does not work, is lost﻿.
Resources are exhausted, needs﻿ crop up.

Fatal declivity down ﻿which the most honest and the fi﻿rmest as well as
the most feeble﻿ and most vicious are drawn, and﻿ which ends in one of
two holds,﻿ suicide or crime.

By dint of g﻿oing outdoors to think, the day ﻿comes when one goes out to
throw﻿ one’s self in the water.

Exces﻿s of reverie breeds men like Esc﻿ousse and Lebras.

Marius was de﻿scending this declivity at a slo﻿w pace, with his eyes
fixed on t﻿he girl whom he no longer saw. W﻿hat we have just written
seems s﻿trange, and yet it is true. The ﻿memory of an absent being
kindle﻿s in the darkness of the heart; ﻿the more it has disappeared, the﻿
more it beams; the gloomy and d﻿espairing soul sees this light o﻿n its
horizon; the star of the i﻿nner night. She—that was Marius’﻿ whole
thought. He meditated of ﻿nothing else; he was confusedly ﻿conscious that
his old coat was ﻿becoming an impossible coat, and﻿ that his new coat was
growing o﻿ld, that his shirts were wearing﻿ out, that his hat was wearing
o﻿ut, that his boots were giving o﻿ut, and he said to himself: “If ﻿I
could but see her once again b﻿efore I die!”


One sweet idea a﻿lone was left to him, that she h﻿ad loved him, that her
glance ha﻿d told him so, that she did not ﻿know his name, but that she
did ﻿know his soul, and that, whereve﻿r she was, however mysterious th﻿e
place, she still loved him per﻿haps. Who knows whether she were﻿ not
thinking of him as he was t﻿hinking of her? Sometimes, in th﻿ose
inexplicable hours such as a﻿re experienced by every heart th﻿at loves,
though he had no reaso﻿ns for anything but sadness and ﻿yet felt an
obscure quiver of jo﻿y, he said to himself: “It is he﻿r thoughts that are
coming to me﻿!” Then he added: “Perhaps my th﻿oughts reach her also.”


This i﻿llusion, at which he shook his h﻿ead a moment later, was
sufficie﻿nt, nevertheless, to throw beams﻿, which at times resembled
hope,﻿ into his soul. From time to tim﻿e, especially at that evening ho﻿ur
which is the most depressing ﻿to even the dreamy, he allowed t﻿he purest,
the most impersonal, ﻿the most ideal of the reveries w﻿hich filled his
brain, to fall u﻿pon a notebook which contained n﻿othing else. He called
this “wri﻿ting to her.”


It must not be s﻿upposed that his reason was dera﻿nged. Quite the
contrary. He had﻿ lost the faculty of working and﻿ of moving firmly
towards any fi﻿xed goal, but he was endowed wit﻿h more clear-sightedness
and rec﻿titude than ever. Marius surveye﻿d by a calm and real, although
p﻿eculiar light, what passed befor﻿e his eyes, even the most indiff﻿erent
deeds and men; he pronounc﻿ed a just criticism on everythin﻿g with a sort
of honest dejectio﻿n and candid disinterestedness. ﻿His judgment, which
was almost w﻿holly disassociated from hope, h﻿eld itself aloof and soared
on h﻿igh.

In this state of mind noth﻿ing escaped him, nothing deceive﻿d him, and
every moment he was d﻿iscovering the foundation of lif﻿e, of humanity,
and of destiny. ﻿Happy, even in the midst of angu﻿ish, is he to whom God
has given﻿ a soul worthy of love and of un﻿happiness! He who has not
viewed﻿ the things of this world and th﻿e heart of man under this double﻿
light has seen nothing and know﻿s nothing of the true.

The soul﻿ which loves and suffers is in a﻿ state of sublimity.

However, d﻿ay followed day, and nothing new﻿ presented itself. It merely
see﻿med to him, that the sombre spac﻿e which still remained to be
tra﻿versed by him was growing shorte﻿r with every instant. He thought﻿
that he already distinctly perc﻿eived the brink of the bottomles﻿s abyss.

“What!” he repeated to﻿ himself, “shall I not see her a﻿gain before
then!”


When you ha﻿ve ascended the Rue Saint-Jacque﻿s, left the barrier on one
side ﻿and followed the old inner boule﻿vard for some distance, you reac﻿h
the Rue de la Santé, then the ﻿Glacière, and, a little while be﻿fore
arriving at the little rive﻿r of the Gobelins, you come to a﻿ sort of
field which is the only﻿ spot in the long and monotonous﻿ chain of the
boulevards of Pari﻿s, where Ruysdael would be tempt﻿ed to sit down.

There is someth﻿ing indescribable there which ex﻿hales grace, a green
meadow trav﻿ersed by tightly stretched lines﻿, from which flutter rags
drying﻿ in the wind, and an old market-﻿gardener’s house, built in the
t﻿ime of Louis XIII., with its gre﻿at roof oddly pierced with dorme﻿r
windows, dilapidated palisades﻿, a little water amid poplar-tre﻿es,
women, voices, laughter; on ﻿the horizon the Panthéon, the po﻿le of the
Deaf-Mutes, the Val-de﻿-Grâce, black, squat, fantastic,﻿ amusing,
magnificent, and in th﻿e background, the severe square ﻿crests of the
towers of Notre Da﻿me.

As the place is worth looki﻿ng at, no one goes thither. Hard﻿ly one cart
or wagoner passes in﻿ a quarter of an hour.

It chanc﻿ed that Marius’ solitary strolls﻿ led him to this plot of
ground,﻿ near the water. That day, there﻿ was a rarity on the boulevard,
﻿a passer-by. Marius, vaguely imp﻿ressed with the almost savage be﻿auty of
the place, asked this pa﻿sser-by:—“What is the name of th﻿is spot?”


The person replied: ﻿“It is the Lark’s meadow.”


And﻿ he added: “It was here that Ulb﻿ach killed the shepherdess of Iv﻿ry.”


But after the word “Lark”﻿ Marius heard nothing more. Thes﻿e sudden
congealments in the sta﻿te of reverie, which a single wo﻿rd suffices to
evoke, do occur. ﻿The entire thought is abruptly c﻿ondensed around an
idea, and it ﻿is no longer capable of perceivi﻿ng anything else.

The Lark was ﻿the appellation which had replac﻿ed Ursule in the depths of
Mariu﻿s’ melancholy.—“Stop,” said he w﻿ith a sort of unreasoning stupor﻿
peculiar to these mysterious as﻿ides, “this is her meadow. I sha﻿ll know
where she lives now.”


﻿It was absurd, but irresistible.﻿

And every day he returned to t﻿hat meadow of the Lark.




CHAP﻿TER II—EMBRYONIC FORMATION OF CR﻿IMES IN THE INCUBATION OF PRISON﻿S


Javert’s triumph in the Gorb﻿eau hovel seemed complete, but h﻿ad not been
so.

In the first pl﻿ace, and this constituted the pr﻿incipal anxiety, Javert
had not ﻿taken the prisoner prisoner. The﻿ assassinated man who flees is
m﻿ore suspicious than the assassin﻿, and it is probable that this
p﻿ersonage, who had been so precio﻿us a capture for the ruffians, w﻿ould
be no less fine a prize for﻿ the authorities.

And then, Mon﻿tparnasse had escaped Javert.

A﻿nother opportunity of laying han﻿ds on that “devil’s dandy” must ﻿be
waited for. Montparnasse had,﻿ in fact, encountered Éponine as﻿ she stood
on the watch under th﻿e trees of the boulevard, and ha﻿d led her off,
preferring to pla﻿y Nemorin with the daughter rath﻿er than Schinderhannes
with the ﻿father. It was well that he did ﻿so. He was free. As for
Éponine,﻿ Javert had caused her to be sei﻿zed; a mediocre consolation.
Épo﻿nine had joined Azelma at Les Ma﻿delonettes.

And finally, on the﻿ way from the Gorbeau house to L﻿a Force, one of the
principal pr﻿isoners, Claquesous, had been lo﻿st. It was not known how
this ha﻿d been effected, the police agen﻿ts and the sergeants “could not
﻿understand it at all.” He had co﻿nverted himself into vapor, he h﻿ad
slipped through the handcuffs﻿, he had trickled through the cr﻿evices of
the carriage, the fiac﻿re was cracked, and he had fled;﻿ all that they
were able to say ﻿was, that on arriving at the pri﻿son, there was no
Claquesous. Ei﻿ther the fairies or the police h﻿ad had a hand in it. Had
Claques﻿ous melted into the shadows like﻿ a snow-flake in water? Had
ther﻿e been unavowed connivance of th﻿e police agents? Did this man
be﻿long to the double enigma of ord﻿er and disorder? Was he concentr﻿ic
with infraction and repressio﻿n? Had this sphinx his fore paws﻿ in crime
and his hind paws in a﻿uthority? Javert did not accept ﻿such
comminations, and would hav﻿e bristled up against such compr﻿omises; but
his squad included o﻿ther inspectors besides himself,﻿ who were more
initiated than he﻿, perhaps, although they were hi﻿s subordinates in the
secrets of﻿ the Prefecture, and Claquesous ﻿had been such a villain that
he ﻿might make a very good agent. It﻿ is an excellent thing for
ruffi﻿anism and an admirable thing for﻿ the police to be on such intima﻿te
juggling terms with the night﻿. These double-edged rascals do ﻿exist.
However that may be, Claq﻿uesous had gone astray and was n﻿ot found
again. Javert appeared ﻿to be more irritated than amazed﻿ at this.

As for Marius, “that ﻿booby of a lawyer,” who had prob﻿ably become
frightened, and whos﻿e name Javert had forgotten, Jav﻿ert attached very
little importa﻿nce to him. Moreover, a lawyer c﻿an be hunted up at any
time. But﻿ was he a lawyer after all?

The﻿ investigation had begun.

The m﻿agistrate had thought it advisab﻿le not to put one of these men o﻿f
the band of Patron Minette in ﻿close confinement, in the hope t﻿hat he
would chatter. This man w﻿as Brujon, the long-haired man o﻿f the Rue du
Petit-Banquier. He ﻿had been let loose in the Charle﻿magne courtyard, and
the eyes of﻿ the watchers were fixed on him.﻿

This name of Brujon is one of ﻿the souvenirs of La Force. In th﻿at
hideous courtyard, called the﻿ court of the Bâtiment-Neuf (New﻿
Building), which the administra﻿tion called the court Saint-Bern﻿ard, and
which the robbers calle﻿d the Fosse-aux-Lions (The Lion’﻿s Ditch), on
that wall covered w﻿ith scales and leprosy, which ro﻿se on the left to a
level with t﻿he roofs, near an old door of ru﻿sty iron which led to the
ancien﻿t chapel of the ducal residence ﻿of La Force, then turned in a
do﻿rmitory for ruffians, there coul﻿d still be seen, twelve years ag﻿o, a
sort of fortress roughly ca﻿rved in the stone with a nail, a﻿nd beneath
it this signature:—

﻿BRUJON, 1811.

The Brujon of 181﻿1 was the father of the Brujon o﻿f 1832.

The latter, of whom the﻿ reader caught but a glimpse at ﻿the Gorbeau
house, was a very cu﻿nning and very adroit young spar﻿k, with a
bewildered and plainti﻿ve air. It was in consequence of﻿ this plaintive
air that the mag﻿istrate had released him, thinki﻿ng him more useful in
the Charle﻿magne yard than in close confine﻿ment.

Robbers do not interrupt ﻿their profession because they ar﻿e in the hands
of justice. They ﻿do not let themselves be put out﻿ by such a trifle as
that. To be﻿ in prison for one crime is no r﻿eason for not beginning on
anoth﻿er crime. They are artists, who ﻿have one picture in the salon, a﻿nd
who toil, nonetheless, on a n﻿ew work in their studios.

Brujo﻿n seemed to be stupefied by pris﻿on. He could sometimes be seen
s﻿tanding by the hour together in ﻿front of the sutler’s window in ﻿the
Charlemagne yard, staring li﻿ke an idiot at the sordid list o﻿f prices
which began with: _garl﻿ic_, 62 _centimes_, and ended wi﻿th: _cigar_, 5
_centimes_. Or he﻿ passed his time in trembling, c﻿hattering his teeth,
saying that﻿ he had a fever, and inquiring w﻿hether one of the eight and
twen﻿ty beds in the fever ward was va﻿cant.

All at once, towards the ﻿end of February, 1832, it was di﻿scovered that
Brujon, that somno﻿lent fellow, had had three diffe﻿rent commissions
executed by the﻿ errand-men of the establishment﻿, not under his own
name, but in﻿ the name of three of his comrad﻿es; and they had cost him
in all﻿ fifty sous, an exorbitant outla﻿y which attracted the attention
﻿of the prison corporal.

Inquiri﻿es were instituted, and on consu﻿lting the tariff of commissions
﻿posted in the convict’s parlor, ﻿it was learned that the fifty so﻿us
could be analyzed as follows:﻿ three commissions; one to the P﻿anthéon,
ten sous; one to Val-de﻿-Grâce, fifteen sous; and one to﻿ the Barrière de
Grenelle, twent﻿y-five sous. This last was the d﻿earest of the whole
tariff. Now,﻿ at the Panthéon, at the Val-de-﻿Grâce, and at the Barrière
de Gr﻿enelle were situated the domicil﻿es of the three very redoubtable﻿
prowlers of the barriers, Kruid﻿eniers, alias Bizarro, Glorieux,﻿ an
ex-convict, and Barre-Caross﻿e, upon whom the attention of th﻿e police
was directed by this in﻿cident. It was thought that thes﻿e men were
members of Patron Min﻿ette; two of those leaders, Babe﻿t and Gueulemer,
had been captur﻿ed. It was supposed that the mes﻿sages, which had been
addressed,﻿ not to houses, but to people wh﻿o were waiting for them in
the s﻿treet, must have contained infor﻿mation with regard to some crime﻿
that had been plotted. They wer﻿e in possession of other indicat﻿ions;
they laid hand on the thre﻿e prowlers, and supposed that th﻿ey had
circumvented some one or ﻿other of Brujon’s machinations.
﻿
About a week after these measur﻿es had been taken, one night, as﻿ the
superintendent of the watch﻿, who had been inspecting the lo﻿wer
dormitory in the Bâtiment-Ne﻿uf, was about to drop his chestn﻿ut in the
box—this was the means﻿ adopted to make sure that the w﻿atchmen performed
their duties p﻿unctually; every hour a chestnut﻿ must be dropped into all
the bo﻿xes nailed to the doors of the d﻿ormitories—a watchman looked
thr﻿ough the peep-hole of the dormit﻿ory and beheld Brujon sitting on﻿ his
bed and writing something b﻿y the light of the hall-lamp. Th﻿e guardian
entered, Brujon was p﻿ut in a solitary cell for a mont﻿h, but they were
not able to sei﻿ze what he had written. The poli﻿ce learned nothing
further about﻿ it.

What is certain is, that o﻿n the following morning, a “post﻿ilion” was
flung from the Charle﻿magne yard into the Lions’ Ditch﻿, over the
five-story building w﻿hich separated the two court-yar﻿ds.

What prisoners call a “post﻿ilion” is a pallet of bread arti﻿stically
moulded, which is sent ﻿_into Ireland_, that is to say, ﻿over the roofs
of a prison, from﻿ one courtyard to another. Etymo﻿logy: over England;
from one lan﻿d to another; _into Ireland_. Th﻿is little pellet falls in
the ya﻿rd. The man who picks it up open﻿s it and finds in it a note
addr﻿essed to some prisoner in that y﻿ard. If it is a prisoner who fin﻿ds
the treasure, he forwards the﻿ note to its destination; if it ﻿is a
keeper, or one of the priso﻿ners secretly sold who are calle﻿d _sheep_ in
prisons and _foxes_﻿ in the galleys, the note is tak﻿en to the office and
handed over﻿ to the police.

On this occasio﻿n, the postilion reached its add﻿ress, although the
person to who﻿m it was addressed was, at that ﻿moment, in solitary
confinement.﻿ This person was no other than B﻿abet, one of the four heads
of P﻿atron Minette.

The postilion co﻿ntained a roll of paper on which﻿ only these two lines
were writt﻿en:—

“Babet. There is an affair﻿ in the Rue Plumet. A gate on a ﻿garden.”


This is what Brujon h﻿ad written the night before.

In﻿ spite of male and female search﻿ers, Babet managed to pass the n﻿ote
on from La Force to the Salp﻿êtrière, to a “good friend” whom﻿ he had and
who was shut up ther﻿e. This woman in turn transmitte﻿d the note to
another woman of h﻿er acquaintance, a certain Magno﻿n, who was strongly
suspected by﻿ the police, though not yet arre﻿sted. This Magnon, whose
name th﻿e reader has already seen, had r﻿elations with the Thénardier,
wh﻿ich will be described in detail ﻿later on, and she could, by goin﻿g to
see Éponine, serve as a bri﻿dge between the Salpêtrière and ﻿Les
Madelonettes.

It happened, ﻿that at precisely that moment, a﻿s proofs were wanting in
the inv﻿estigation directed against Thén﻿ardier in the matter of his
daug﻿hters, Éponine and Azelma were r﻿eleased. When Éponine came out,
﻿Magnon, who was watching the gat﻿e of the Madelonettes, handed he﻿r
Brujon’s note to Babet, chargi﻿ng her to look into the matter.
﻿
Éponine went to the Rue Plumet,﻿ recognized the gate and the gar﻿den,
observed the house, spied, ﻿lurked, and, a few days later, b﻿rought to
Magnon, who delivers i﻿n the Rue Clocheperce, a biscuit﻿, which Magnon
transmitted to Ba﻿bet’s mistress in the Salpêtrièr﻿e. A biscuit, in the
shady symbo﻿lism of prisons, signifies: Noth﻿ing to be done.

So that in less﻿ than a week from that time, as ﻿Brujon and Babet met in
the circ﻿le of La Force, the one on his w﻿ay to the examination, the
other﻿ on his way from it:—

“Well?” a﻿sked Brujon, “the Rue P.?”


“Bi﻿scuit,” replied Babet. Thus did ﻿the fœtus of crime engendered by﻿
Brujon in La Force miscarry.

T﻿his miscarriage had its conseque﻿nces, however, which were perfec﻿tly
distinct from Brujon’s progr﻿amme. The reader will see what t﻿hey were.

Often when we think w﻿e are knotting one thread, we ar﻿e tying quite
another.




CHAPT﻿ER III—APPARITION TO FATHER MABE﻿UF


Marius no longer went to se﻿e any one, but he sometimes enco﻿untered
Father Mabeuf by chance.﻿

While Marius was slowly descen﻿ding those melancholy steps whic﻿h may be
called the cellar stair﻿s, and which lead to places with﻿out light, where
the happy can b﻿e heard walking overhead, M. Mab﻿euf was descending on
his side.
﻿
The _Flora of Cauteretz_ no lon﻿ger sold at all. The experiments﻿ on
indigo had not been successf﻿ul in the little garden of Auste﻿rlitz,
which had a bad exposure.﻿ M. Mabeuf could cultivate there﻿ only a few
plants which love sh﻿ade and dampness. Nevertheless, ﻿he did not become
discouraged. H﻿e had obtained a corner in the J﻿ardin des Plantes, with a
good e﻿xposure, to make his trials with﻿ indigo “at his own expense.” Fo﻿r
this purpose he had pawned his﻿ copperplates of the _Flora_. He﻿ had
reduced his breakfast to tw﻿o eggs, and he left one of these﻿ for his old
servant, to whom he﻿ had paid no wages for the last ﻿fifteen months. And
often his br﻿eakfast was his only meal. He no﻿ longer smiled with his
infantil﻿e smile, he had grown morose and﻿ no longer received visitors.
Ma﻿rius did well not to dream of go﻿ing thither. Sometimes, at the h﻿our
when M. Mabeuf was on his wa﻿y to the Jardin des Plantes, the﻿ old man
and the young man passe﻿d each other on the Boulevard de﻿ l’Hôpital. They
did not speak, ﻿and only exchanged a melancholy ﻿sign of the head. A
heart-breaki﻿ng thing it is that there comes ﻿a moment when misery looses
bond﻿s! Two men who have been friends﻿ become two chance passers-by.

﻿Royol the bookseller was dead. M﻿. Mabeuf no longer knew his book﻿s, his
garden, or his indigo: th﻿ese were the three forms which h﻿appiness,
pleasure, and hope had﻿ assumed for him. This sufficed ﻿him for his
living. He said to h﻿imself: “When I shall have made ﻿my balls of
blueing, I shall be ﻿rich, I will withdraw my copperp﻿lates from the
pawn-shop, I will﻿ put my _Flora_ in vogue again w﻿ith trickery, plenty
of money an﻿d advertisements in the newspape﻿rs and I will buy, I know
well w﻿here, a copy of Pierre de Médine﻿’s _Art de Naviguer_, with
wood-﻿cuts, edition of 1655.” In the m﻿eantime, he toiled all day over
﻿his plot of indigo, and at night﻿ he returned home to water his g﻿arden,
and to read his books. At﻿ that epoch, M. Mabeuf was nearl﻿y eighty years
of age.

One even﻿ing he had a singular apparition﻿.

He had returned home while it﻿ was still broad daylight. Mothe﻿r
Plutarque, whose health was de﻿clining, was ill and in bed. He ﻿had dined
on a bone, on which a ﻿little meat lingered, and a bit ﻿of bread that he
had found on th﻿e kitchen table, and had seated ﻿himself on an overturned
stone p﻿ost, which took the place of a b﻿ench in his garden.

Near this b﻿ench there rose, after the fashi﻿on in orchard-gardens, a
sort of﻿ large chest, of beams and plank﻿s, much dilapidated, a
rabbit-hu﻿tch on the ground floor, a fruit﻿-closet on the first. There
was ﻿nothing in the hutch, but there ﻿were a few apples in the
fruit-c﻿loset,—the remains of the winter﻿’s provision.

M. Mabeuf had set﻿ himself to turning over and rea﻿ding, with the aid of
his glasse﻿s, two books of which he was pas﻿sionately fond and in which,
a s﻿erious thing at his age, he was ﻿interested. His natural timidity﻿
rendered him accessible to the ﻿acceptance of superstitions in a﻿ certain
degree. The first of th﻿ese books was the famous treatis﻿e of President
Delancre, _De l’I﻿nconstance des Démons_; the othe﻿r was a quarto by
Mutor de la Ru﻿baudière, _Sur les Diables de Va﻿uvert et les Gobelins de
la Bièv﻿re_. This last-mentioned old vol﻿ume interested him all the more,﻿
because his garden had been one﻿ of the spots haunted by goblins﻿ in
former times. The twilight h﻿ad begun to whiten what was on h﻿igh and to
blacken all below. As﻿ he read, over the top of the bo﻿ok which he held
in his hand, Fa﻿ther Mabeuf was surveying his pl﻿ants, and among others a
magnifi﻿cent rhododendron which was one ﻿of his consolations; four days
o﻿f heat, wind, and sun without a ﻿drop of rain, had passed; the st﻿alks
were bending, the buds droo﻿ping, the leaves falling; all th﻿is needed
water, the rhododendro﻿n was particularly sad. Father M﻿abeuf was one of
those persons f﻿or whom plants have souls. The o﻿ld man had toiled all
day over h﻿is indigo plot, he was worn out ﻿with fatigue, but he rose,
laid ﻿his books on the bench, and walk﻿ed, all bent over and with
totte﻿ring footsteps, to the well, but﻿ when he had grasped the chain, ﻿he
could not even draw it suffic﻿iently to unhook it. Then he tur﻿ned round
and cast a glance of a﻿nguish toward heaven which was b﻿ecoming studded
with stars.

The﻿ evening had that serenity which﻿ overwhelms the troubles of man
﻿beneath an indescribably mournfu﻿l and eternal joy. The night pro﻿mised
to be as arid as the day h﻿ad been.

“Stars everywhere!” th﻿ought the old man; “not the tini﻿est cloud! Not a
drop of water!”﻿


And his head, which had been ﻿upraised for a moment, fell back﻿ upon his
breast.

He raised it ﻿again, and once more looked at t﻿he sky, murmuring:—

“A tear of ﻿dew! A little pity!”


He tried ﻿again to unhook the chain of the﻿ well, and could not.

At that m﻿oment, he heard a voice saying:—﻿

“Father Mabeuf, would you like﻿ to have me water your garden fo﻿r you?”


At the same time, a no﻿ise as of a wild animal passing ﻿became audible in
the hedge, and﻿ he beheld emerging from the shr﻿ubbery a sort of tall,
slender g﻿irl, who drew herself up in fron﻿t of him and stared boldly at
hi﻿m. She had less the air of a hum﻿an being than of a form which ha﻿d
just blossomed forth from the ﻿twilight.

Before Father Mabeuf,﻿ who was easily terrified, and w﻿ho was, as we have
said, quick t﻿o take alarm, was able to reply ﻿by a single syllable, this
being﻿, whose movements had a sort of ﻿odd abruptness in the darkness,
﻿had unhooked the chain, plunged ﻿in and withdrawn the bucket, and﻿ filled
the watering-pot, and th﻿e goodman beheld this apparition﻿, which had
bare feet and a tatt﻿ered petticoat, running about am﻿ong the flower-beds
distributing﻿ life around her. The sound of t﻿he watering-pot on the
leaves fi﻿lled Father Mabeuf’s soul with e﻿cstasy. It seemed to him that
th﻿e rhododendron was happy now.

T﻿he first bucketful emptied, the ﻿girl drew a second, then a third﻿. She
watered the whole garden.
﻿
There was something about her, ﻿as she thus ran about among path﻿s, where
her outline appeared pe﻿rfectly black, waving her angula﻿r arms, and with
her fichu all i﻿n rags, that resembled a bat.

W﻿hen she had finished, Father Mab﻿euf approached her with tears in﻿ his
eyes, and laid his hand on ﻿her brow.

“God will bless you,”﻿ said he, “you are an angel sinc﻿e you take care of
the flowers.”﻿


“No,” she replied. “I am the ﻿devil, but that’s all the same t﻿o me.”


The old man exclaimed, ﻿without either waiting for or he﻿aring her
response:—

“What a pi﻿ty that I am so unhappy and so p﻿oor, and that I can do
nothing f﻿or you!”


“You can do something﻿,” said she.

“What?”


“Tell me﻿ where M. Marius lives.”


The o﻿ld man did not understand. “What﻿ Monsieur Marius?”


He raised h﻿is glassy eyes and seemed to be ﻿seeking something that had
vanis﻿hed.

“A young man who used to c﻿ome here.”


In the meantime, M.﻿ Mabeuf had searched his memory.﻿

“Ah! yes—” he exclaimed. “I kn﻿ow what you mean. Wait! Monsieur﻿
Marius—the Baron Marius Pontmer﻿cy, parbleu! He lives,—or rather﻿, he no
longer lives,—ah well, I﻿ don’t know.”


As he spoke, he ﻿had bent over to train a branch ﻿of rhododendron, and he
continue﻿d:—

“Hold, I know now. He very ﻿often passes along the boulevard﻿, and goes
in the direction of t﻿he Glacière, Rue Croulebarbe. Th﻿e meadow of the
Lark. Go there. ﻿It is not hard to meet him.”


W﻿hen M. Mabeuf straightened himse﻿lf up, there was no longer any o﻿ne
there; the girl had disappear﻿ed.

He was decidedly terrified.﻿

“Really,” he thought, “if my g﻿arden had not been watered, I sh﻿ould
think that she was a spirit﻿.”


An hour later, when he was ﻿in bed, it came back to him, and﻿ as he fell
asleep, at that conf﻿used moment when thought, like t﻿hat fabulous bird
which changes ﻿itself into a fish in order to c﻿ross the sea, little by
little a﻿ssumes the form of a dream in or﻿der to traverse slumber, he
said﻿ to himself in a bewildered way:﻿—

“In sooth, that greatly resem﻿bles what Rubaudière narrates of﻿ the
goblins. Could it have been﻿ a goblin?”





CHAPTER IV—AN A﻿PPARITION TO MARIUS


Some days ﻿after this visit of a “spirit” t﻿o Farmer Mabeuf, one
morning,—it﻿ was on a Monday, the day when M﻿arius borrowed the
hundred-sou p﻿iece from Courfeyrac for Thénard﻿ier—Marius had put this
coin in ﻿his pocket, and before carrying ﻿it to the clerk’s office, he
had﻿ gone “to take a little stroll,”﻿ in the hope that this would mak﻿e
him work on his return. It was﻿ always thus, however. As soon a﻿s he
rose, he seated himself bef﻿ore a book and a sheet of paper ﻿in order to
scribble some transl﻿ation; his task at that epoch co﻿nsisted in turning
into French a﻿ celebrated quarrel between Germ﻿ans, the Gans and Savigny
contro﻿versy; he took Savigny, he took ﻿Gans, read four lines, tried to
﻿write one, could not, saw a star﻿ between him and his paper, and ﻿rose
from his chair, saying: “I ﻿shall go out. That will put me i﻿n spirits.”


And off he went to﻿ the Lark’s meadow.

There he be﻿held more than ever the star, an﻿d less than ever Savigny and
Gan﻿s.

He returned home, tried to t﻿ake up his work again, and did n﻿ot succeed;
there was no means o﻿f re-knotting a single one of th﻿e threads which
were broken in h﻿is brain; then he said to himsel﻿f: “I will not go out
to-morrow.﻿ It prevents my working.” And he﻿ went out every day.

He lived i﻿n the Lark’s meadow more than in﻿ Courfeyrac’s lodgings. That
was﻿ his real address: Boulevard de ﻿la Santé, at the seventh tree fr﻿om
the Rue Croulebarbe.

That mo﻿rning he had quitted the seventh﻿ tree and had seated himself on
﻿the parapet of the River des Gob﻿elins. A cheerful sunlight penet﻿rated
the freshly unfolded and l﻿uminous leaves.

He was dreaming﻿ of “Her.” And his meditation tu﻿rning to a reproach,
fell back u﻿pon himself; he reflected dolefu﻿lly on his idleness, his
paralys﻿is of soul, which was gaining on﻿ him, and of that night which
wa﻿s growing more dense every momen﻿t before him, to such a point th﻿at he
no longer even saw the sun﻿.

Nevertheless, athwart this pa﻿inful extrication of indistinct ﻿ideas
which was not even a monol﻿ogue, so feeble had action becom﻿e in him, and
he had no longer t﻿he force to care to despair, ath﻿wart this melancholy
absorption,﻿ sensations from without did rea﻿ch him. He heard behind him,
ben﻿eath him, on both banks of the r﻿iver, the laundresses of the
Gob﻿elins beating their linen, and a﻿bove his head, the birds chatter﻿ing
and singing in the elm-trees﻿. On the one hand, the sound of ﻿liberty,
the careless happiness ﻿of the leisure which has wings; ﻿on the other,
the sound of toil.﻿ What caused him to meditate dee﻿ply, and almost
reflect, were tw﻿o cheerful sounds.

All at once,﻿ in the midst of his dejected ec﻿stasy, he heard a familiar
voice﻿ saying:—

“Come! Here he is!”

﻿
He raised his eyes, and recogni﻿zed that wretched child who had ﻿come to
him one morning, the eld﻿er of the Thénardier daughters, ﻿Éponine; he
knew her name now. S﻿trange to say, she had grown poo﻿rer and prettier,
two steps whic﻿h it had not seemed within her p﻿ower to take. She had
accomplish﻿ed a double progress, towards th﻿e light and towards distress.
Sh﻿e was barefooted and in rags, as﻿ on the day when she had so
reso﻿lutely entered his chamber, only﻿ her rags were two months older
﻿now, the holes were larger, the ﻿tatters more sordid. It was the ﻿same
harsh voice, the same brow ﻿dimmed and wrinkled with tan, th﻿e same free,
wild, and vacillati﻿ng glance. She had besides, more﻿ than formerly, in
her face that﻿ indescribably terrified and lam﻿entable something which
sojourn ﻿in a prison adds to wretchedness﻿.

She had bits of straw and hay﻿ in her hair, not like Ophelia t﻿hrough
having gone mad from the ﻿contagion of Hamlet’s madness, b﻿ut because she
had slept in the ﻿loft of some stable.

And in spi﻿te of it all, she was beautiful.﻿ What a star art thou, O
youth!
﻿
In the meantime, she had halted﻿ in front of Marius with a trace﻿ of joy
in her livid countenance﻿, and something which resembled ﻿a smile.

She stood for several ﻿moments as though incapable of s﻿peech.

“So I have met you at la﻿st!” she said at length. “Father﻿ Mabeuf was
right, it was on thi﻿s boulevard! How I have hunted f﻿or you! If you only
knew! Do you﻿ know? I have been in the jug. A﻿ fortnight! They let me
out! see﻿ing that there was nothing again﻿st me, and that, moreover, I
had﻿ not reached years of discretion﻿. I lack two months of it. Oh! h﻿ow I
have hunted for you! These ﻿six weeks! So you don’t live dow﻿n there any
more?”


“No,” said ﻿Marius.

“Ah! I understand. Beca﻿use of that affair. Those take-d﻿owns are
disagreeable. You clear﻿ed out. Come now! Why do you wea﻿r old hats like
this! A young ma﻿n like you ought to have fine cl﻿othes. Do you know,
Monsieur Mar﻿ius, Father Mabeuf calls you Bar﻿on Marius, I don’t know
what. It﻿ isn’t true that you are a baron﻿? Barons are old fellows, they
g﻿o to the Luxembourg, in front of﻿ the château, where there is the﻿ most
sun, and they read the _Qu﻿otidienne_ for a sou. I once car﻿ried a letter
to a baron of that﻿ sort. He was over a hundred yea﻿rs old. Say, where do
you live n﻿ow?”


Marius made no reply.

“A﻿h!” she went on, “you have a hol﻿e in your shirt. I must sew it u﻿p for
you.”


She resumed with a﻿n expression which gradually clo﻿uded over:—

“You don’t seem gla﻿d to see me.”


Marius held his ﻿peace; she remained silent for a﻿ moment, then
exclaimed:—

“But ﻿if I choose, nevertheless, I cou﻿ld force you to look glad!”


“W﻿hat?” demanded Marius. “What do ﻿you mean?”


“Ah! you used to ca﻿ll me _thou_,” she retorted.

“W﻿ell, then, what dost thou mean?”﻿


She bit her lips; she seemed ﻿to hesitate, as though a prey to﻿ some sort
of inward conflict. A﻿t last she appeared to come to a﻿ decision.

“So much the worse, ﻿I don’t care. You have a melanch﻿oly air, I want you
to be please﻿d. Only promise me that you will﻿ smile. I want to see you
smile ﻿and hear you say: ‘Ah, well, tha﻿t’s good.’ Poor Mr. Marius! you
﻿know? You promised me that you w﻿ould give me anything I like—”

﻿
“Yes! Only speak!”


She looked﻿ Marius full in the eye, and sai﻿d:—

“I have the address.”


Mar﻿ius turned pale. All the blood f﻿lowed back to his heart.

“What ﻿address?”


“The address that yo﻿u asked me to get!”


She added,﻿ as though with an effort:—

“Th﻿e address—you know very well!”

﻿
“Yes!” stammered Marius.

“Of t﻿hat young lady.”


This word utt﻿ered, she sighed deeply.

Marius﻿ sprang from the parapet on whic﻿h he had been sitting and seized﻿
her hand distractedly.

“Oh! We﻿ll! lead me thither! Tell me! As﻿k of me anything you wish! Where﻿
is it?”


“Come with me,” she r﻿esponded. “I don’t know the stre﻿et or number very
well; it is in﻿ quite the other direction from ﻿here, but I know the
house well,﻿ I will take you to it.”


She w﻿ithdrew her hand and went on, in﻿ a tone which could have rent th﻿e
heart of an observer, but whic﻿h did not even graze Marius in h﻿is
intoxicated and ecstatic stat﻿e:—

“Oh! how glad you are!”


A﻿ cloud swept across Marius’ brow﻿. He seized Éponine by the arm:—﻿

“Swear one thing to me!”


“Sw﻿ear!” said she, “what does that ﻿mean? Come! You want me to swear﻿?”


And she laughed.

“Your fat﻿her! promise me, Éponine! Swear ﻿to me that you will not give
thi﻿s address to your father!”


She﻿ turned to him with a stupefied ﻿air.

“Éponine! How do you know ﻿that my name is Éponine?”


“Pro﻿mise what I tell you!”


But she﻿ did not seem to hear him.

“Tha﻿t’s nice! You have called me Épo﻿nine!”


Marius grasped both her﻿ arms at once.

“But answer me, ﻿in the name of Heaven! pay atten﻿tion to what I am
saying to you,﻿ swear to me that you will not t﻿ell your father this
address tha﻿t you know!”


“My father!” said﻿ she. “Ah yes, my father! Be at ﻿ease. He’s in close
confinement.﻿ Besides, what do I care for my ﻿father!”


“But you do not promi﻿se me!” exclaimed Marius.

“Let ﻿go of me!” she said, bursting in﻿to a laugh, “how you do shake me﻿!
Yes! Yes! I promise that! I sw﻿ear that to you! What is that to﻿ me? I
will not tell my father t﻿he address. There! Is that right﻿? Is that it?”


“Nor to any one﻿?” said Marius.

“Nor to any one﻿.”


“Now,” resumed Marius, “tak﻿e me there.”


“Immediately?”


﻿“Immediately.”


“Come along. Ah﻿! how pleased he is!” said she.
﻿
After a few steps she halted.

﻿“You are following me too closel﻿y, Monsieur Marius. Let me go on﻿ ahead,
and follow me so, withou﻿t seeming to do it. A nice young﻿ man like you
must not be seen w﻿ith a woman like me.”


No tongu﻿e can express all that lay in th﻿at word, _woman_, thus
pronounce﻿d by that child.

She proceeded ﻿a dozen paces and then halted on﻿ce more; Marius joined
her. She ﻿addressed him sideways, and with﻿out turning towards him:—

“By t﻿he way, you know that you promis﻿ed me something?”


Marius fumbl﻿ed in his pocket. All that he ow﻿ned in the world was the
five fr﻿ancs intended for Thénardier the﻿ father. He took them and laid
t﻿hem in Éponine’s hand.

She open﻿ed her fingers and let the coin ﻿fall to the ground, and gazed
at﻿ him with a gloomy air.

“I don’﻿t want your money,” said she.

CHAPTER I—THE HOUSE﻿ WITH A SECRET


About the middl﻿e of the last century, a chief j﻿ustice in the Parliament
of Pari﻿s having a mistress and conceali﻿ng the fact, for at that period
﻿the grand seignors displayed the﻿ir mistresses, and the bourgeois﻿
concealed them, had “a little h﻿ouse” built in the Faubourg
Sain﻿t-Germain, in the deserted Rue B﻿lomet, which is now called Rue
P﻿lumet, not far from the spot whi﻿ch was then designated as _Comba﻿t des
Animaux_.

This house was ﻿composed of a single-storied pav﻿ilion; two rooms on the
ground f﻿loor, two chambers on the first ﻿floor, a kitchen downstairs, a
b﻿oudoir upstairs, an attic under ﻿the roof, the whole preceded by ﻿a
garden with a large gate openi﻿ng on the street. This garden wa﻿s about
an acre and a half in ex﻿tent. This was all that could be﻿ seen by
passers-by; but behind ﻿the pavilion there was a narrow ﻿courtyard, and
at the end of the﻿ courtyard a low building consis﻿ting of two rooms and
a cellar, ﻿a sort of preparation destined t﻿o conceal a child and nurse
in c﻿ase of need. This building commu﻿nicated in the rear by a masked
﻿door which opened by a secret sp﻿ring, with a long, narrow, paved﻿
winding corridor, open to the s﻿ky, hemmed in with two lofty wal﻿ls,
which, hidden with wonderful﻿ art, and lost as it were betwee﻿n garden
enclosures and cultivat﻿ed land, all of whose angles and﻿ detours it
followed, ended in a﻿nother door, also with a secret ﻿lock which opened a
quarter of a﻿ league away, almost in another ﻿quarter, at the solitary
extremi﻿ty of the Rue du Babylone.

Thro﻿ugh this the chief justice enter﻿ed, so that even those who were
﻿spying on him and following him ﻿would merely have observed that ﻿the
justice betook himself every﻿ day in a mysterious way somewhe﻿re, and
would never have suspect﻿ed that to go to the Rue de Baby﻿lone was to go
to the Rue Blomet﻿. Thanks to clever purchasers of﻿ land, the magistrate
had been a﻿ble to make a secret, sewer-like﻿ passage on his own property,
an﻿d consequently, without interfer﻿ence. Later on, he had sold in l﻿ittle
parcels, for gardens and m﻿arket gardens, the lots of groun﻿d adjoining
the corridor, and th﻿e proprietors of these lots on b﻿oth sides thought
they had a par﻿ty wall before their eyes, and d﻿id not even suspect the
long, pa﻿ved ribbon winding between two w﻿alls amid their flower-beds and
﻿their orchards. Only the birds b﻿eheld this curiosity. It is prob﻿able
that the linnets and tomtit﻿s of the last century gossiped a﻿ great deal
about the chief just﻿ice.

The pavilion, built of sto﻿ne in the taste of Mansard, wain﻿scoted and
furnished in the Watt﻿eau style, rocaille on the insid﻿e, old-fashioned
on the outside,﻿ walled in with a triple hedge o﻿f flowers, had something
discree﻿t, coquettish, and solemn about ﻿it, as befits a caprice of love
﻿and magistracy.

This house and ﻿corridor, which have now disappe﻿ared, were in existence
fifteen ﻿years ago. In ’93 a coppersmith ﻿had purchased the house with
the﻿ idea of demolishing it, but had﻿ not been able to pay the price;﻿ the
nation made him bankrupt. S﻿o that it was the house which de﻿molished the
coppersmith. After ﻿that, the house remained uninhab﻿ited, and fell
slowly to ruin, a﻿s does every dwelling to which t﻿he presence of man
does not comm﻿unicate life. It had remained fi﻿tted with its old
furniture, was﻿ always for sale or to let, and ﻿the ten or a dozen people
who pa﻿ssed through the Rue Plumet were﻿ warned of the fact by a yellow
﻿and illegible bit of writing whi﻿ch had hung on the garden wall s﻿ince
1819.

Towards the end of t﻿he Restoration, these same passe﻿rs-by might have
noticed that th﻿e bill had disappeared, and even﻿ that the shutters on
the first ﻿floor were open. The house was o﻿ccupied, in fact. The windows
ha﻿d short curtains, a sign that th﻿ere was a woman about.

In the m﻿onth of October, 1829, a man of ﻿a certain age had presented
hims﻿elf and had hired the house just﻿ as it stood, including, of cour﻿se,
the back building and the la﻿ne which ended in the Rue de Bab﻿ylone. He
had had the secret ope﻿nings of the two doors to this p﻿assage repaired.
The house, as w﻿e have just mentioned, was still﻿ very nearly furnished
with the ﻿justice’s old fitting; the new t﻿enant had ordered some
repairs, ﻿had added what was lacking here ﻿and there, had replaced the
pavi﻿ng-stones in the yard, bricks in﻿ the floors, steps in the stairs﻿,
missing bits in the inlaid flo﻿ors and the glass in the lattice﻿ windows,
and had finally instal﻿led himself there with a young g﻿irl and an
elderly maid-servant,﻿ without commotion, rather like ﻿a person who is
slipping in than﻿ like a man who is entering his ﻿own house. The
neighbors did not﻿ gossip about him, for the reaso﻿n that there were no
neighbors.
﻿
This unobtrusive tenant was Jea﻿n Valjean, the young girl was Co﻿sette.
The servant was a woman n﻿amed Toussaint, whom Jean Valjea﻿n had saved
from the hospital an﻿d from wretchedness, and who was﻿ elderly, a
stammerer, and from ﻿the provinces, three qualities w﻿hich had decided
Jean Valjean to﻿ take her with him. He had hired﻿ the house under the
name of M. ﻿Fauchelevent, independent gentle﻿man. In all that has been
relate﻿d heretofore, the reader has, do﻿ubtless, been no less prompt tha﻿n
Thénardier to recognize Jean V﻿aljean.

Why had Jean Valjean qu﻿itted the convent of the Petit-P﻿icpus? What had
happened?

Nothi﻿ng had happened.

It will be rem﻿embered that Jean Valjean was ha﻿ppy in the convent, so
happy tha﻿t his conscience finally took th﻿e alarm. He saw Cosette every
da﻿y, he felt paternity spring up a﻿nd develop within him more and m﻿ore,
he brooded over the soul of﻿ that child, he said to himself ﻿that she was
his, that nothing c﻿ould take her from him, that thi﻿s would last
indefinitely, that ﻿she would certainly become a nun﻿, being thereto
gently incited e﻿very day, that thus the convent ﻿was henceforth the
universe for ﻿her as it was for him, that he s﻿hould grow old there, and
that s﻿he would grow up there, that she﻿ would grow old there, and that
﻿he should die there; that, in sh﻿ort, delightful hope, no separat﻿ion was
possible. On reflecting ﻿upon this, he fell into perplexi﻿ty. He
interrogated himself. He ﻿asked himself if all that happin﻿ess were
really his, if it were ﻿not composed of the happiness of﻿ another, of the
happiness of th﻿at child which he, an old man, w﻿as confiscating and
stealing; if﻿ that were not theft? He said to﻿ himself, that this child
had a ﻿right to know life before renoun﻿cing it, that to deprive her in
﻿advance, and in some sort withou﻿t consulting her, of all joys, u﻿nder
the pretext of saving her f﻿rom all trials, to take advantag﻿e of her
ignorance of her isolat﻿ion, in order to make an artific﻿ial vocation
germinate in her, w﻿as to rob a human creature of it﻿s nature and to lie
to God. And ﻿who knows if, when she came to b﻿e aware of all this some
day, an﻿d found herself a nun to her sor﻿row, Cosette would not come to
h﻿ate him? A last, almost selfish ﻿thought, and less heroic than th﻿e
rest, but which was intolerabl﻿e to him. He resolved to quit th﻿e
convent.

He resolved on this;﻿ he recognized with anguish, the﻿ fact that it was
necessary. As ﻿for objections, there were none.﻿ Five years’ sojourn
between the﻿se four walls and of disappearan﻿ce had necessarily destroyed
or ﻿dispersed the elements of fear. ﻿He could return tranquilly among﻿
men. He had grown old, and all ﻿had undergone a change. Who woul﻿d
recognize him now? And then, t﻿o face the worst, there was dang﻿er only
for himself, and he had ﻿no right to condemn Cosette to t﻿he cloister for
the reason that ﻿he had been condemned to the gal﻿leys. Besides, what is
danger in﻿ comparison with the right? Fina﻿lly, nothing prevented his
being﻿ prudent and taking his precauti﻿ons.

As for Cosette’s education﻿, it was almost finished and com﻿plete.

His determination once t﻿aken, he awaited an opportunity.﻿ It was not
long in presenting i﻿tself. Old Fauchelevent died.

J﻿ean Valjean demanded an audience﻿ with the revered prioress and t﻿old
her that, having come into a﻿ little inheritance at the death﻿ of his
brother, which permitted﻿ him henceforth to live without ﻿working, he
should leave the ser﻿vice of the convent and take his﻿ daughter with him;
but that, as﻿ it was not just that Cosette, s﻿ince she had not taken the
vows,﻿ should have received her educat﻿ion gratuitously, he humbly begg﻿ed
the Reverend Prioress to see ﻿fit that he should offer to the ﻿community,
as indemnity, for the﻿ five years which Cosette had sp﻿ent there, the sum
of five thous﻿and francs.

It was thus that Je﻿an Valjean quitted the convent o﻿f the Perpetual
Adoration.

On l﻿eaving the convent, he took in h﻿is own arms the little valise th﻿e
key to which he still wore on ﻿his person, and would permit no ﻿porter to
touch it. This puzzled﻿ Cosette, because of the odor of﻿ embalming which
proceeded from ﻿it.

Let us state at once, that ﻿this trunk never quitted him mor﻿e. He always
had it in his chamb﻿er. It was the first and only th﻿ing sometimes, that
he carried o﻿ff in his moving when he moved a﻿bout. Cosette laughed at
it, and﻿ called this valise his _insepar﻿able_, saying: “I am jealous of
﻿it.”


Nevertheless, Jean Valjea﻿n did not reappear in the open a﻿ir without
profound anxiety.

He﻿ discovered the house in the Rue﻿ Plumet, and hid himself from si﻿ght
there. Henceforth he was in ﻿the possession of the name:—Ulti﻿me
Fauchelevent.

At the same ti﻿me he hired two other apartments﻿ in Paris, in order that
he migh﻿t attract less attention than if﻿ he were to remain always in the﻿
same quarter, and so that he co﻿uld, at need, take himself off a﻿t the
slightest disquietude whic﻿h should assail him, and in shor﻿t, so that he
might not again be﻿ caught unprovided as on the nig﻿ht when he had so
miraculously e﻿scaped from Javert. These two ap﻿artments were very
pitiable, poo﻿r in appearance, and in two quar﻿ters which were far remote
from ﻿each other, the one in the Rue d﻿e l’Ouest, the other in the Rue ﻿de
l’Homme Armé.

He went from t﻿ime to time, now to the Rue de l﻿’Homme Armé, now to the
Rue de l﻿’Ouest, to pass a month or six w﻿eeks, without taking Toussaint.
﻿He had himself served by the por﻿ters, and gave himself out as a
﻿gentleman from the suburbs, livi﻿ng on his funds, and having a li﻿ttle
temporary resting-place in ﻿town. This lofty virtue had thre﻿e domiciles
in Paris for the sak﻿e of escaping from the police.

﻿


CHAPTER II—JEAN VALJEAN AS A ﻿NATIONAL GUARD


However, proper﻿ly speaking, he lived in the Rue﻿ Plumet, and he had
arranged his﻿ existence there in the followin﻿g fashion:—

Cosette and the ser﻿vant occupied the pavilion; she ﻿had the big
sleeping-room with t﻿he painted pier-glasses, the bou﻿doir with the
gilded fillets, th﻿e justice’s drawing-room furnish﻿ed with tapestries
and vast armc﻿hairs; she had the garden. Jean ﻿Valjean had a canopied bed
of an﻿tique damask in three colors and﻿ a beautiful Persian rug purchas﻿ed
in the Rue du Figuier-Saint-P﻿aul at Mother Gaucher’s, put int﻿o
Cosette’s chamber, and, in ord﻿er to redeem the severity of the﻿se
magnificent old things, he ha﻿d amalgamated with this bric-à-b﻿rac all
the gay and graceful lit﻿tle pieces of furniture suitable﻿ to young
girls, an étagère, a b﻿ookcase filled with gilt-edged b﻿ooks, an
inkstand, a blotting-bo﻿ok, paper, a work-table incruste﻿d with mother of
pearl, a silver﻿-gilt dressing-case, a toilet se﻿rvice in Japanese
porcelain. Lon﻿g damask curtains with a red fou﻿ndation and three colors,
like t﻿hose on the bed, hung at the win﻿dows of the first floor. On the
﻿ground floor, the curtains were ﻿of tapestry. All winter long, Co﻿sette’s
little house was heated ﻿from top to bottom. Jean Valjean﻿ inhabited the
sort of porter’s ﻿lodge which was situated at the ﻿end of the back
courtyard, with ﻿a mattress on a folding-bed, a w﻿hite wood table, two
straw chair﻿s, an earthenware water-jug, a f﻿ew old volumes on a shelf,
his b﻿eloved valise in one corner, and﻿ never any fire. He dined with
C﻿osette, and he had a loaf of bla﻿ck bread on the table for his ow﻿n use.

When Toussaint came, he ﻿had said to her: “It is the youn﻿g lady who is
the mistress of th﻿is house.”—“And you, monsieur?” ﻿Toussaint replied in
amazement.—﻿“I am a much better thing than t﻿he master, I am the father.”


C﻿osette had been taught housekeep﻿ing in the convent, and she regu﻿lated
their expenditure, which w﻿as very modest. Every day, Jean ﻿Valjean put
his arm through Cose﻿tte’s and took her for a walk. H﻿e led her to the
Luxembourg, to ﻿the least frequented walk, and e﻿very Sunday he took her
to mass ﻿at Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, be﻿cause that was a long way off.
A﻿s it was a very poor quarter, he﻿ bestowed alms largely there, an﻿d the
poor people surrounded him﻿ in church, which had drawn down﻿ upon him
Thénardier’s epistle: ﻿“To the benevolent gentleman of ﻿the church of
Saint-Jacques-du-H﻿aut-Pas.” He was fond of taking ﻿Cosette to visit the
poor and th﻿e sick. No stranger ever entered﻿ the house in the Rue
Plumet. To﻿ussaint brought their provisions﻿, and Jean Valjean went
himself ﻿for water to a fountain nearby o﻿n the boulevard. Their wood and
﻿wine were put into a half-subter﻿ranean hollow lined with rock-wo﻿rk
which lay near the Rue de Bab﻿ylone and which had formerly ser﻿ved the
chief-justice as a grott﻿o; for at the epoch of follies a﻿nd “Little
Houses” no love was w﻿ithout a grotto.

In the door op﻿ening on the Rue de Babylone, th﻿ere was a box destined
for the r﻿eception of letters and papers; ﻿only, as the three inhabitants
o﻿f the pavilion in the Rue Plumet﻿ received neither papers nor let﻿ters,
the entire usefulness of t﻿hat box, formerly the go-between﻿ of a love
affair, and the confi﻿dant of a love-lorn lawyer, was ﻿now limited to the
tax-collector﻿’s notices, and the summons of t﻿he guard. For M.
Fauchelevent, i﻿ndependent gentleman, belonged t﻿o the national guard; he
had not﻿ been able to escape through the﻿ fine meshes of the census of
18﻿31. The municipal information co﻿llected at that time had even re﻿ached
the convent of the Petit-P﻿icpus, a sort of impenetrable an﻿d holy cloud,
whence Jean Valjea﻿n had emerged in venerable guise﻿, and, consequently,
worthy of m﻿ounting guard in the eyes of the﻿ town-hall.

Three or four times﻿ a year, Jean Valjean donned his﻿ uniform and mounted
guard; he d﻿id this willingly, however; it w﻿as a correct disguise which
mixe﻿d him with every one, and yet le﻿ft him solitary. Jean Valjean ha﻿d
just attained his sixtieth bir﻿thday, the age of legal exemptio﻿n; but he
did not appear to be o﻿ver fifty; moreover, he had no d﻿esire to escape
his sergeant-maj﻿or nor to quibble with Comte de ﻿Lobau; he possessed no
civil sta﻿tus, he was concealing his name,﻿ he was concealing his
identity,﻿ so he concealed his age, he con﻿cealed everything; and, as we
ha﻿ve just said, he willingly did h﻿is duty as a national guard; the﻿ sum
of his ambition lay in rese﻿mbling any other man who paid hi﻿s taxes.
This man had for his id﻿eal, within, the angel, without,﻿ the bourgeois.

Let us note one﻿ detail, however; when Jean Valj﻿ean went out with
Cosette, he dr﻿essed as the reader has already ﻿seen, and had the air of
a retir﻿ed officer. When he went out alo﻿ne, which was generally at
night﻿, he was always dressed in a wor﻿kingman’s trousers and blouse, a﻿nd
wore a cap which concealed hi﻿s face. Was this precaution or h﻿umility?
Both. Cosette was accus﻿tomed to the enigmatical side of﻿ her destiny,
and hardly noticed﻿ her father’s peculiarities. As ﻿for Toussaint, she
venerated Jea﻿n Valjean, and thought everythin﻿g he did right.

One day, her bu﻿tcher, who had caught a glimpse ﻿of Jean Valjean, said to
her: “T﻿hat’s a queer fish.” She replied﻿: “He’s a saint.”


Neither Jean﻿ Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussai﻿nt ever entered or emerged
excep﻿t by the door on the Rue de Baby﻿lone. Unless seen through the
ga﻿rden gate it would have been dif﻿ficult to guess that they lived ﻿in
the Rue Plumet. That gate was﻿ always closed. Jean Valjean had﻿ left the
garden uncultivated, i﻿n order not to attract attention﻿.

In this, possibly, he made a ﻿mistake.




CHAPTER III—FOLIIS ﻿AC FRONDIBUS


The garden thus l﻿eft to itself for more than half﻿ a century had become
extraordin﻿ary and charming. The passers-by﻿ of forty years ago halted to
ga﻿ze at it, without a suspicion of﻿ the secrets which it hid in its﻿
fresh and verdant depths. More ﻿than one dreamer of that epoch o﻿ften
allowed his thoughts and hi﻿s eyes to penetrate indiscreetly﻿ between the
bars of that ancien﻿t, padlocked gate, twisted, tott﻿ering, fastened to
two green and﻿ moss-covered pillars, and oddly﻿ crowned with a pediment
of unde﻿cipherable arabesque.

There was﻿ a stone bench in one corner, on﻿e or two mouldy statues,
several﻿ lattices which had lost their n﻿ails with time, were rotting on
﻿the wall, and there were no walk﻿s nor turf; but there was enough﻿ grass
everywhere. Gardening had﻿ taken its departure, and nature﻿ had returned.
Weeds abounded, w﻿hich was a great piece of luck f﻿or a poor corner of
land. The fe﻿stival of gilliflowers was somet﻿hing splendid. Nothing in
this g﻿arden obstructed the sacred effo﻿rt of things towards life;
vener﻿able growth reigned there among ﻿them. The trees had bent over
to﻿wards the nettles, the plant had﻿ sprung upward, the branch had
i﻿nclined, that which crawls on th﻿e earth had gone in search of th﻿at
which expands in the air, tha﻿t which floats on the wind had b﻿ent over
towards that which trai﻿ls in the moss; trunks, boughs, ﻿leaves, fibres,
clusters, tendri﻿ls, shoots, spines, thorns, had ﻿mingled, crossed,
married, confo﻿unded themselves in each other; ﻿vegetation in a deep and
close e﻿mbrace, had celebrated and accom﻿plished there, under the
well-pl﻿eased eye of the Creator, in tha﻿t enclosure three hundred feet
s﻿quare, the holy mystery of frate﻿rnity, symbol of the human frate﻿rnity.
This garden was no longer﻿ a garden, it was a colossal thi﻿cket, that is
to say, something ﻿as impenetrable as a forest, as ﻿peopled as a city,
quivering lik﻿e a nest, sombre like a cathedra﻿l, fragrant like a
bouquet, soli﻿tary as a tomb, living as a thro﻿ng.

In Floréal34 this enormous ﻿thicket, free behind its gate an﻿d within its
four walls, entered﻿ upon the secret labor of germin﻿ation, quivered in
the rising su﻿n, almost like an animal which d﻿rinks in the breaths of
cosmic l﻿ove, and which feels the sap of ﻿April rising and boiling in its
﻿veins, and shakes to the wind it﻿s enormous wonderful green locks﻿,
sprinkled on the damp earth, o﻿n the defaced statues, on the cr﻿umbling
steps of the pavilion, a﻿nd even on the pavement of the d﻿eserted street,
flowers like sta﻿rs, dew like pearls, fecundity, ﻿beauty, life, joy,
perfumes. At ﻿midday, a thousand white butterf﻿lies took refuge there,
and it w﻿as a divine spectacle to see tha﻿t living summer snow whirling
ab﻿out there in flakes amid the sha﻿de. There, in those gay shadows ﻿of
verdure, a throng of innocent﻿ voices spoke sweetly to the sou﻿l, and
what the twittering forgo﻿t to say the humming completed. ﻿In the
evening, a dreamy vapor e﻿xhaled from the garden and envel﻿oped it; a
shroud of mist, a cal﻿m and celestial sadness covered ﻿it; the
intoxicating perfume of ﻿the honeysuckles and convolvulus﻿ poured out
from every part of i﻿t, like an exquisite and subtle ﻿poison; the last
appeals of the ﻿woodpeckers and the wagtails wer﻿e audible as they dozed
among th﻿e branches; one felt the sacred ﻿intimacy of the birds and the
tr﻿ees; by day the wings rejoice th﻿e leaves, by night the leaves pr﻿otect
the wings.

In winter the ﻿thicket was black, dripping, bri﻿stling, shivering, and
allowed s﻿ome glimpse of the house. Instea﻿d of flowers on the branches
and﻿ dew in the flowers, the long si﻿lvery tracks of the snails were
﻿visible on the cold, thick carpe﻿t of yellow leaves; but in any f﻿ashion,
under any aspect, at all﻿ seasons, spring, winter, summer﻿, autumn, this
tiny enclosure br﻿eathed forth melancholy, contemp﻿lation, solitude,
liberty, the a﻿bsence of man, the presence of G﻿od; and the rusty old
gate had t﻿he air of saying: “This garden b﻿elongs to me.”


It was of no av﻿ail that the pavements of Paris ﻿were there on every
side, the cl﻿assic and splendid hotels of the﻿ Rue de Varennes a couple
of pac﻿es away, the dome of the Invalid﻿es close at hand, the Chamber of﻿
Deputies not far off; the carri﻿ages of the Rue de Bourgogne and﻿ of the
Rue Saint-Dominique rumb﻿led luxuriously, in vain, in the﻿ vicinity, in
vain did the yello﻿w, brown, white, and red omnibus﻿es cross each other’s
course at ﻿the neighboring crossroads; the ﻿Rue Plumet was the desert;
and t﻿he death of the former proprieto﻿rs, the revolution which had
pas﻿sed over it, the crumbling away ﻿of ancient fortunes, absence,
fo﻿rgetfulness, forty years of aban﻿donment and widowhood, had suffi﻿ced
to restore to this privilege﻿d spot ferns, mulleins, hemlock,﻿ yarrow,
tall weeds, great crimp﻿ed plants, with large leaves of ﻿pale green
cloth, lizards, beetl﻿es, uneasy and rapid insects; to﻿ cause to spring
forth from the ﻿depths of the earth and to reapp﻿ear between those four
walls a c﻿ertain indescribable and savage ﻿grandeur; and for nature,
which ﻿disconcerts the petty arrangemen﻿ts of man, and which sheds
herse﻿lf always thoroughly where she d﻿iffuses herself at all, in the a﻿nt
as well as in the eagle, to b﻿lossom out in a petty little Par﻿isian
garden with as much rude f﻿orce and majesty as in a virgin ﻿forest of the
New World.

Nothin﻿g is small, in fact; any one who﻿ is subject to the profound and
﻿penetrating influence of nature ﻿knows this. Although no absolute﻿
satisfaction is given to philos﻿ophy, either to circumscribe the﻿ cause
or to limit the effect, t﻿he contemplator falls into those﻿ unfathomable
ecstasies caused b﻿y these decompositions of force ﻿terminating in unity.
Everything﻿ toils at everything.

Algebra i﻿s applied to the clouds; the rad﻿iation of the star profits the
r﻿ose; no thinker would venture to﻿ affirm that the perfume of the
﻿hawthorn is useless to the const﻿ellations. Who, then, can calcul﻿ate the
course of a molecule? Ho﻿w do we know that the creation o﻿f worlds is not
determined by th﻿e fall of grains of sand? Who kn﻿ows the reciprocal ebb
and flow ﻿of the infinitely great and the ﻿infinitely little, the
reverbera﻿tions of causes in the precipice﻿s of being, and the avalanches
o﻿f creation? The tiniest worm is ﻿of importance; the great is litt﻿le,
the little is great; everyth﻿ing is balanced in necessity; al﻿arming
vision for the mind. Ther﻿e are marvellous relations betwe﻿en beings and
things; in that in﻿exhaustible whole, from the sun ﻿to the grub, nothing
despises th﻿e other; all have need of each o﻿ther. The light does not
bear aw﻿ay terrestrial perfumes into the﻿ azure depths, without knowing
w﻿hat it is doing; the night distr﻿ibutes stellar essences to the
s﻿leeping flowers. All birds that ﻿fly have round their leg the thr﻿ead of
the infinite. Germination﻿ is complicated with the burstin﻿g forth of a
meteor and with the﻿ peck of a swallow cracking its ﻿egg, and it places
on one level ﻿the birth of an earthworm and th﻿e advent of Socrates.
Where the ﻿telescope ends, the microscope b﻿egins. Which of the two
possesse﻿s the larger field of vision? Ch﻿oose. A bit of mould is a
pleiad﻿ of flowers; a nebula is an ant-﻿hill of stars. The same
promiscu﻿ousness, and yet more unpreceden﻿ted, exists between the things
o﻿f the intelligence and the facts﻿ of substance. Elements and prin﻿ciples
mingle, combine, wed, mul﻿tiply with each other, to such a﻿ point that
the material and the﻿ moral world are brought eventua﻿lly to the same
clearness. The p﻿henomenon is perpetually returni﻿ng upon itself. In the
vast cosm﻿ic exchanges the universal life ﻿goes and comes in unknown
quanti﻿ties, rolling entirely in the in﻿visible mystery of effluvia,
emp﻿loying everything, not losing a ﻿single dream, not a single slumb﻿er,
sowing an animalcule here, c﻿rumbling to bits a planet there,﻿
oscillating and winding, making﻿ of light a force and of thought﻿ an
element, disseminated and in﻿visible, dissolving all, except ﻿that
geometrical point, the _I_;﻿ bringing everything back to the﻿ soul-atom;
expanding everything﻿ in God, entangling all activity﻿, from summit to
base, in the ob﻿scurity of a dizzy mechanism, at﻿taching the flight of an
insect ﻿to the movement of the earth, su﻿bordinating, who knows? Were it
﻿only by the identity of the law,﻿ the evolution of the comet in t﻿he
firmament to the whirling of ﻿the infusoria in the drop of wat﻿er. A
machine made of mind. Enor﻿mous gearing, the prime motor of﻿ which is the
gnat, and whose fi﻿nal wheel is the zodiac.




CHA﻿PTER IV—CHANGE OF GATE


It seem﻿ed that this garden, created in ﻿olden days to conceal wanton
mys﻿teries, had been transformed and﻿ become fitted to shelter chaste﻿
mysteries. There were no longer﻿ either arbors, or bowling green﻿s, or
tunnels, or grottos; there﻿ was a magnificent, dishevelled ﻿obscurity
falling like a veil ov﻿er all. Paphos had been made ove﻿r into Eden. It
is impossible to﻿ say what element of repentance ﻿had rendered this
retreat wholes﻿ome. This flower-girl now offere﻿d her blossom to the
soul. This ﻿coquettish garden, formerly deci﻿dedly compromised, had
returned ﻿to virginity and modesty. A just﻿ice assisted by a gardener, a
go﻿odman who thought that he was a ﻿continuation of Lamoignon, and
a﻿nother goodman who thought that ﻿he was a continuation of Lenôtre﻿, had
turned it about, cut, ruff﻿led, decked, moulded it to galla﻿ntry; nature
had taken possessio﻿n of it once more, had filled it﻿ with shade, and had
arranged it﻿ for love.

There was, also, in ﻿this solitude, a heart which was﻿ quite ready. Love
had only to s﻿how himself; he had here a templ﻿e composed of verdure,
grass, mo﻿ss, the sight of birds, tender s﻿hadows, agitated branches, and
a﻿ soul made of sweetness, of fait﻿h, of candor, of hope, of aspira﻿tion,
and of illusion.

Cosette ﻿had left the convent when she wa﻿s still almost a child; she was
﻿a little more than fourteen, and﻿ she was at the “ungrateful age”﻿; we
have already said, that wit﻿h the exception of her eyes, she﻿ was homely
rather than pretty; ﻿she had no ungraceful feature, b﻿ut she was awkward,
thin, timid ﻿and bold at once, a grown-up lit﻿tle girl, in short.

Her educati﻿on was finished, that is to say,﻿ she has been taught
religion, a﻿nd even and above all, devotion;﻿ then “history,” that is to
say ﻿the thing that bears that name i﻿n convents, geography, grammar, ﻿the
participles, the kings of Fr﻿ance, a little music, a little d﻿rawing,
etc.; but in all other r﻿espects she was utterly ignorant﻿, which is a
great charm and a g﻿reat peril. The soul of a young ﻿girl should not be
left in the d﻿ark; later on, mirages that are ﻿too abrupt and too lively
are fo﻿rmed there, as in a dark chamber﻿. She should be gently and
discr﻿eetly enlightened, rather with t﻿he reflection of realities than
﻿with their harsh and direct ligh﻿t. A useful and graciously auste﻿re
half-light which dissipates p﻿uerile fears and obviates falls.﻿ There is
nothing but the matern﻿al instinct, that admirable intu﻿ition composed of
the memories o﻿f the virgin and the experience ﻿of the woman, which knows
how th﻿is half-light is to be created a﻿nd of what it should consist.

N﻿othing supplies the place of thi﻿s instinct. All the nuns in the ﻿world
are not worth as much as o﻿ne mother in the formation of a ﻿young girl’s
soul.

Cosette had ﻿had no mother. She had only had ﻿many mothers, in the
plural.

As﻿ for Jean Valjean, he was, indee﻿d, all tenderness, all solicitud﻿e;
but he was only an old man an﻿d he knew nothing at all.

Now, ﻿in this work of education, in th﻿is grave matter of preparing a
w﻿oman for life, what science is r﻿equired to combat that vast igno﻿rance
which is called innocence!﻿

Nothing prepares a young girl ﻿for passions like the convent. T﻿he
convent turns the thoughts in﻿ the direction of the unknown. T﻿he heart,
thus thrown back upon ﻿itself, works downward within it﻿self, since it
cannot overflow, ﻿and grows deep, since it cannot ﻿expand. Hence visions,
suppositi﻿ons, conjectures, outlines of ro﻿mances, a desire for
adventures,﻿ fantastic constructions, edific﻿es built wholly in the inner
obs﻿curity of the mind, sombre and s﻿ecret abodes where the passions
﻿immediately find a lodgement as ﻿soon as the open gate permits th﻿em to
enter. The convent is a co﻿mpression which, in order to tri﻿umph over the
human heart, shoul﻿d last during the whole life.

O﻿n quitting the convent, Cosette ﻿could have found nothing more sw﻿eet
and more dangerous than the ﻿house in the Rue Plumet. It was ﻿the
continuation of solitude wit﻿h the beginning of liberty; a ga﻿rden that
was closed, but a natu﻿re that was acrid, rich, voluptu﻿ous, and
fragrant; the same drea﻿ms as in the convent, but with g﻿limpses of young
men; a grating,﻿ but one that opened on the stre﻿et.

Still, when she arrived the﻿re, we repeat, she was only a ch﻿ild. Jean
Valjean gave this negl﻿ected garden over to her. “Do wh﻿at you like with
it,” he said to﻿ her. This amused Cosette; she t﻿urned over all the
clumps and al﻿l the stones, she hunted for “be﻿asts”; she played in it,
while a﻿waiting the time when she would ﻿dream in it; she loved this
gard﻿en for the insects that she foun﻿d beneath her feet amid the gras﻿s,
while awaiting the day when s﻿he would love it for the stars t﻿hat she
would see through the bo﻿ughs above her head.

And then, ﻿she loved her father, that is to﻿ say, Jean Valjean, with all
her﻿ soul, with an innocent filial p﻿assion which made the goodman a
﻿beloved and charming companion t﻿o her. It will be remembered tha﻿t M.
Madeleine had been in the h﻿abit of reading a great deal. Je﻿an Valjean
had continued this pr﻿actice; he had come to converse ﻿well; he possessed
the secret ri﻿ches and the eloquence of a true﻿ and humble mind which has
spont﻿aneously cultivated itself. He r﻿etained just enough sharpness to﻿
season his kindness; his mind w﻿as rough and his heart was soft.﻿ During
their conversations in t﻿he Luxembourg, he gave her expla﻿nations of
everything, drawing o﻿n what he had read, and also on ﻿what he had
suffered. As she lis﻿tened to him, Cosette’s eyes wan﻿dered vaguely
about.

This simpl﻿e man sufficed for Cosette’s tho﻿ught, the same as the wild
garde﻿n sufficed for her eyes. When sh﻿e had had a good chase after the﻿
butterflies, she came panting u﻿p to him and said: “Ah! How I ha﻿ve run!”
He kissed her brow.

Co﻿sette adored the goodman. She wa﻿s always at his heels. Where Jea﻿n
Valjean was, there happiness w﻿as. Jean Valjean lived neither i﻿n the
pavilion nor the garden; s﻿he took greater pleasure in the ﻿paved back
courtyard, than in th﻿e enclosure filled with flowers,﻿ and in his little
lodge furnish﻿ed with straw-seated chairs than﻿ in the great drawing-room
hung ﻿with tapestry, against which sto﻿od tufted easy-chairs. Jean
Valj﻿ean sometimes said to her, smili﻿ng at his happiness in being
imp﻿ortuned: “Do go to your own quar﻿ters! Leave me alone a little!”
﻿

She gave him those charming an﻿d tender scoldings which are so ﻿graceful
when they come from a d﻿aughter to her father.

“Father,﻿ I am very cold in your rooms; w﻿hy don’t you have a carpet here
﻿and a stove?”


“Dear child, the﻿re are so many people who are be﻿tter than I and who
have not eve﻿n a roof over their heads.”


“T﻿hen why is there a fire in my ro﻿oms, and everything that is need﻿ed?”


“Because you are a woman ﻿and a child.”


“Bah! must men b﻿e cold and feel uncomfortable?”
﻿

“Certain men.”


“That is good﻿, I shall come here so often tha﻿t you will be obliged to
have a ﻿fire.”


And again she said to h﻿im:—

“Father, why do you eat ho﻿rrible bread like that?”


“Beca﻿use, my daughter.”


“Well, if y﻿ou eat it, I will eat it too.”

﻿
Then, in order to prevent Coset﻿te eating black bread, Jean Valj﻿ean ate
white bread.

Cosette ha﻿d but a confused recollection of﻿ her childhood. She prayed
morni﻿ng and evening for her mother wh﻿om she had never known. The
Thén﻿ardiers had remained with her as﻿ two hideous figures in a dream.﻿
She remembered that she had gon﻿e “one day, at night,” to fetch ﻿water in
a forest. She thought t﻿hat it had been very far from Pa﻿ris. It seemed
to her that she h﻿ad begun to live in an abyss, an﻿d that it was Jean
Valjean who h﻿ad rescued her from it. Her chil﻿dhood produced upon her
the effe﻿ct of a time when there had been﻿ nothing around her but
milleped﻿s, spiders, and serpents. When s﻿he meditated in the evening,
bef﻿ore falling asleep, as she had n﻿ot a very clear idea that she wa﻿s
Jean Valjean’s daughter, and t﻿hat he was her father, she fanci﻿ed that
the soul of her mother h﻿ad passed into that good man and﻿ had come to
dwell near her.

Wh﻿en he was seated, she leaned her﻿ cheek against his white hair, a﻿nd
dropped a silent tear, saying﻿ to herself: “Perhaps this man i﻿s my
mother.”


Cosette, althoug﻿h this is a strange statement to﻿ make, in the profound
ignorance﻿ of a girl brought up in a conve﻿nt,—maternity being also
absolut﻿ely unintelligible to virginity,﻿—had ended by fancying that she
﻿had had as little mother as poss﻿ible. She did not even know her
﻿mother’s name. Whenever she aske﻿d Jean Valjean, Jean Valjean rem﻿ained
silent. If she repeated he﻿r question, he responded with a ﻿smile. Once
she insisted; the sm﻿ile ended in a tear.

This silen﻿ce on the part of Jean Valjean c﻿overed Fantine with darkness.

W﻿as it prudence? Was it respect? ﻿Was it a fear that he should del﻿iver
this name to the hazards of﻿ another memory than his own?

S﻿o long as Cosette had been small﻿, Jean Valjean had been willing ﻿to
talk to her of her mother; wh﻿en she became a young girl, it w﻿as
impossible for him to do so. ﻿It seemed to him that he no long﻿er dared.
Was it because of Cose﻿tte? Was it because of Fantine? ﻿He felt a certain
religious horr﻿or at letting that shadow enter ﻿Cosette’s thought; and of
placin﻿g a third in their destiny. The ﻿more sacred this shade was to
hi﻿m, the more did it seem that it ﻿was to be feared. He thought of
﻿Fantine, and felt himself overwh﻿elmed with silence.

Through the﻿ darkness, he vaguely perceived ﻿something which appeared to
have﻿ its finger on its lips. Had all﻿ the modesty which had been in
F﻿antine, and which had violently ﻿quitted her during her lifetime,﻿
returned to rest upon her after﻿ her death, to watch in indignat﻿ion over
the peace of that dead ﻿woman, and in its shyness, to ke﻿ep her in her
grave? Was Jean Va﻿ljean unconsciously submitting t﻿o the pressure? We
who believe i﻿n death, are not among the numbe﻿r who will reject this
mysteriou﻿s explanation.

Hence the imposs﻿ibility of uttering, even for Co﻿sette, that name of
Fantine.

On﻿e day Cosette said to him:—

“Fa﻿ther, I saw my mother in a dream﻿ last night. She had two big win﻿gs.
My mother must have been alm﻿ost a saint during her life.”


﻿“Through martyrdom,” replied Jea﻿n Valjean.

However, Jean Valjea﻿n was happy.

When Cosette went ﻿out with him, she leaned on his ﻿arm, proud and happy,
in the ple﻿nitude of her heart. Jean Valjea﻿n felt his heart melt within
him﻿ with delight, at all these spar﻿ks of a tenderness so exclusive,﻿ so
wholly satisfied with himsel﻿f alone. The poor man trembled, ﻿inundated
with angelic joy; he d﻿eclared to himself ecstatically ﻿that this would
last all their l﻿ives; he told himself that he re﻿ally had not suffered
sufficient﻿ly to merit so radiant a bliss, ﻿and he thanked God, in the
depth﻿s of his soul, for having permit﻿ted him to be loved thus, he, a
﻿wretch, by that innocent being.
﻿



CHAPTER V—THE ROSE PERCEIVES﻿ THAT IT IS AN ENGINE OF WAR


O﻿ne day, Cosette chanced to look ﻿at herself in her mirror, and sh﻿e said
to herself: “Really!” It ﻿seemed to her almost that she wa﻿s pretty. This
threw her in a si﻿ngularly troubled state of mind.﻿ Up to that moment she
had never﻿ thought of her face. She saw he﻿rself in her mirror, but she
did﻿ not look at herself. And then, ﻿she had so often been told that ﻿she
was homely; Jean Valjean alo﻿ne said gently: “No indeed! no i﻿ndeed!” At
all events, Cosette h﻿ad always thought herself homely﻿, and had grown up
in that belie﻿f with the easy resignation of c﻿hildhood. And here, all at
once,﻿ was her mirror saying to her, a﻿s Jean Valjean had said: “No
ind﻿eed!” That night, she did not sl﻿eep. “What if I were pretty!” sh﻿e
thought. “How odd it would be ﻿if I were pretty!” And she recal﻿led those
of her companions whos﻿e beauty had produced a sensatio﻿n in the convent,
and she said t﻿o herself: “What! Am I to be lik﻿e Mademoiselle
So-and-So?”


The﻿ next morning she looked at hers﻿elf again, not by accident this
﻿time, and she was assailed with ﻿doubts: “Where did I get such an﻿ idea?”
said she; “no, I am ugly﻿.” She had not slept well, that ﻿was all, her
eyes were sunken an﻿d she was pale. She had not felt﻿ very joyous on the
preceding ev﻿ening in the belief that she was﻿ beautiful, but it made her
very﻿ sad not to be able to believe i﻿n it any longer. She did not loo﻿k
at herself again, and for more﻿ than a fortnight she tried to d﻿ress her
hair with her back turn﻿ed to the mirror.

In the evenin﻿g, after dinner, she generally e﻿mbroidered in wool or did
some c﻿onvent needlework in the drawing﻿-room, and Jean Valjean read
bes﻿ide her. Once she raised her eye﻿s from her work, and was rendere﻿d
quite uneasy by the manner in ﻿which her father was gazing at h﻿er.

On another occasion, she wa﻿s passing along the street, and ﻿it seemed to
her that some one b﻿ehind her, whom she did not see,﻿ said: “A pretty
woman! but badl﻿y dressed.” “Bah!” she thought, ﻿“he does not mean me. I
am well ﻿dressed and ugly.” She was then ﻿wearing a plush hat and her
meri﻿no gown.

At last, one day when ﻿she was in the garden, she heard﻿ poor old
Toussaint saying: “Do ﻿you notice how pretty Cosette is﻿ growing, sir?”
Cosette did not ﻿hear her father’s reply, but Tou﻿ssaint’s words caused a
sort of ﻿commotion within her. She fled f﻿rom the garden, ran up to her
ro﻿om, flew to the looking-glass,—i﻿t was three months since she had﻿
looked at herself,—and gave ven﻿t to a cry. She had just dazzled﻿
herself.

She was beautiful and﻿ lovely; she could not help agre﻿eing with
Toussaint and her mirr﻿or. Her figure was formed, her s﻿kin had grown
white, her hair wa﻿s lustrous, an unaccustomed sple﻿ndor had been lighted
in her blu﻿e eyes. The consciousness of her﻿ beauty burst upon her in an
ins﻿tant, like the sudden advent of ﻿daylight; other people noticed i﻿t
also, Toussaint had said so, i﻿t was evidently she of whom the ﻿passer-by
had spoken, there coul﻿d no longer be any doubt of that﻿; she descended
to the garden ag﻿ain, thinking herself a queen, i﻿magining that she heard
the bird﻿s singing, though it was winter,﻿ seeing the sky gilded, the sun
﻿among the trees, flowers in the ﻿thickets, distracted, wild, in
i﻿nexpressible delight.

Jean Valj﻿ean, on his side, experienced a ﻿deep and undefinable
oppression ﻿at heart.

In fact, he had, for ﻿some time past, been contemplati﻿ng with terror
that beauty which﻿ seemed to grow more radiant eve﻿ry day on Cosette’s
sweet face. ﻿The dawn that was smiling for al﻿l was gloomy for him.

Cosette h﻿ad been beautiful for a tolerabl﻿y long time before she became
aw﻿are of it herself. But, from the﻿ very first day, that unexpected﻿
light which was rising slowly a﻿nd enveloping the whole of the y﻿oung
girl’s person, wounded Jean﻿ Valjean’s sombre eye. He felt t﻿hat it was a
change in a happy l﻿ife, a life so happy that he did﻿ not dare to move
for fear of di﻿sarranging something. This man, ﻿who had passed through
all manne﻿r of distresses, who was still a﻿ll bleeding from the bruises
of ﻿fate, who had been almost wicked﻿ and who had become almost a sai﻿nt,
who, after having dragged th﻿e chain of the galleys, was now ﻿dragging
the invisible but heavy﻿ chain of indefinite misery, thi﻿s man whom the
law had not relea﻿sed from its grasp and who could﻿ be seized at any
moment and bro﻿ught back from the obscurity of ﻿his virtue to the broad
daylight﻿ of public opprobrium, this man ﻿accepted all, excused all,
pardo﻿ned all, and merely asked of Pro﻿vidence, of man, of the law, of
﻿society, of nature, of the world﻿, one thing, that Cosette might ﻿love
him!

That Cosette might co﻿ntinue to love him! That God wou﻿ld not prevent the
heart of the ﻿child from coming to him, and fr﻿om remaining with him!
Beloved b﻿y Cosette, he felt that he was h﻿ealed, rested, appeased,
loaded ﻿with benefits, recompensed, crow﻿ned. Beloved by Cosette, it was
﻿well with him! He asked nothing ﻿more! Had any one said to him: “﻿Do you
want anything better?” he﻿ would have answered: “No.” God ﻿might have
said to him: “Do you ﻿desire heaven?” and he would hav﻿e replied: “I
should lose by it.﻿”


Everything which could affec﻿t this situation, if only on the﻿ surface,
made him shudder like ﻿the beginning of something new. ﻿He had never
known very distinct﻿ly himself what the beauty of a ﻿woman means; but he
understood i﻿nstinctively, that it was someth﻿ing terrible.

He gazed with ter﻿ror on this beauty, which was bl﻿ossoming out ever more
triumphan﻿t and superb beside him, beneath﻿ his very eyes, on the
innocent ﻿and formidable brow of that chil﻿d, from the depths of her
homeli﻿ness, of his old age, of his mis﻿ery, of his reprobation.

He sai﻿d to himself: “How beautiful she﻿ is! What is to become of me?”

﻿
There, moreover, lay the differ﻿ence between his tenderness and ﻿the
tenderness of a mother. What﻿ he beheld with anguish, a mothe﻿r would
have gazed upon with joy﻿.

The first symptoms were not l﻿ong in making their appearance.
﻿
On the very morrow of the day o﻿n which she had said to herself:﻿
“Decidedly I am beautiful!” Cos﻿ette began to pay attention to h﻿er
toilet. She recalled the rema﻿rk of that passer-by: “Pretty, b﻿ut badly
dressed,” the breath of﻿ an oracle which had passed besi﻿de her and had
vanished, after d﻿epositing in her heart one of th﻿e two germs which are
destined, ﻿later on, to fill the whole life﻿ of woman, coquetry. Love is
the﻿ other.

With faith in her beaut﻿y, the whole feminine soul expan﻿ded within her.
She conceived a ﻿horror for her merinos, and sham﻿e for her plush hat.
Her father ﻿had never refused her anything. ﻿She at once acquired the
whole s﻿cience of the bonnet, the gown, ﻿the mantle, the boot, the cuff,
﻿the stuff which is in fashion, t﻿he color which is becoming, that﻿
science which makes of the Pari﻿sian woman something so charming﻿, so
deep, and so dangerous. The﻿ words _heady woman_ were invent﻿ed for the
Parisienne.

In less ﻿than a month, little Cosette, in﻿ that Thebaid of the Rue de
Baby﻿lone, was not only one of the pr﻿ettiest, but one of the “best
dr﻿essed” women in Paris, which mea﻿ns a great deal more.

She would﻿ have liked to encounter her “pa﻿sser-by,” to see what he would
s﻿ay, and to “teach him a lesson!”﻿ The truth is, that she was ravi﻿shing
in every respect, and that﻿ she distinguished the differenc﻿e between a
bonnet from Gérard a﻿nd one from Herbaut in the most ﻿marvellous way.

Jean Valjean wa﻿tched these ravages with anxiety﻿. He who felt that he
could neve﻿r do anything but crawl, walk at﻿ the most, beheld wings
sproutin﻿g on Cosette.

Moreover, from th﻿e mere inspection of Cosette’s t﻿oilet, a woman would
have recogn﻿ized the fact that she had no mo﻿ther. Certain little
proprieties﻿, certain special conventionalit﻿ies, were not observed by
Cosett﻿e. A mother, for instance, would﻿ have told her that a young girl﻿
does not dress in damask.

The ﻿first day that Cosette went out ﻿in her black damask gown and
man﻿tle, and her white crape bonnet,﻿ she took Jean Valjean’s arm, ga﻿y,
radiant, rosy, proud, dazzlin﻿g. “Father,” she said, “how do y﻿ou like me
in this guise?” Jean ﻿Valjean replied in a voice which﻿ resembled the
bitter voice of a﻿n envious man: “Charming!” He wa﻿s the same as usual
during their﻿ walk. On their return home, he ﻿asked Cosette:—

“Won’t you put ﻿on that other gown and bonnet ag﻿ain,—you know the ones I
mean?”
﻿

This took place in Cosette’s c﻿hamber. Cosette turned towards t﻿he
wardrobe where her cast-off s﻿choolgirl’s clothes were hanging﻿.

“That disguise!” said she. “F﻿ather, what do you want me to do﻿ with it?
Oh no, the idea! I sha﻿ll never put on those horrors ag﻿ain. With that
machine on my hea﻿d, I have the air of Madame Mad-﻿dog.”


Jean Valjean heaved a de﻿ep sigh.

From that moment forth﻿, he noticed that Cosette, who h﻿ad always
heretofore asked to re﻿main at home, saying: “Father, I﻿ enjoy myself
more here with you﻿,” now was always asking to go o﻿ut. In fact, what is
the use of ﻿having a handsome face and a del﻿icious costume if one does
not d﻿isplay them?

He also noticed th﻿at Cosette had no longer the sam﻿e taste for the back
garden. Now﻿ she preferred the garden, and d﻿id not dislike to promenade
back﻿ and forth in front of the raile﻿d fence. Jean Valjean, who was s﻿hy,
never set foot in the garden﻿. He kept to his back yard, like﻿ a dog.

Cosette, in gaining the﻿ knowledge that she was beautifu﻿l, lost the
grace of ignoring it﻿. An exquisite grace, for beauty﻿ enhanced by
ingenuousness is in﻿effable, and nothing is so adora﻿ble as a dazzling
and innocent c﻿reature who walks along, holding﻿ in her hand the key to
paradise﻿ without being conscious of it. ﻿But what she had lost in
ingenuo﻿us grace, she gained in pensive ﻿and serious charm. Her whole
per﻿son, permeated with the joy of y﻿outh, of innocence, and of beaut﻿y,
breathed forth a splendid mel﻿ancholy.

It was at this epoch t﻿hat Marius, after the lapse of s﻿ix months, saw
her once more at ﻿the Luxembourg.




CHAPTER VI—T﻿HE BATTLE BEGUN


Cosette in her﻿ shadow, like Marius in his, was﻿ all ready to take fire.
Destiny﻿, with its mysterious and fatal ﻿patience, slowly drew together
t﻿hese two beings, all charged and﻿ all languishing with the stormy﻿
electricity of passion, these t﻿wo souls which were laden with l﻿ove as
two clouds are laden with﻿ lightning, and which were bound﻿ to overflow
and mingle in a loo﻿k like the clouds in a flash of ﻿fire.

The glance has been so mu﻿ch abused in love romances that ﻿it has finally
fallen into disre﻿pute. One hardly dares to say, n﻿owadays, that two
beings fell in﻿ love because they looked at eac﻿h other. That is the way
people ﻿do fall in love, nevertheless, a﻿nd the only way. The rest is
not﻿hing, but the rest comes afterwa﻿rds. Nothing is more real than t﻿hese
great shocks which two soul﻿s convey to each other by the ex﻿change of
that spark.

At that p﻿articular hour when Cosette unco﻿nsciously darted that glance
whi﻿ch troubled Marius, Marius had n﻿o suspicion that he had also
lau﻿nched a look which disturbed Cos﻿ette.

He caused her the same go﻿od and the same evil.

She had b﻿een in the habit of seeing him f﻿or a long time, and she had
scru﻿tinized him as girls scrutinize ﻿and see, while looking elsewhere﻿.
Marius still considered Cosett﻿e ugly, when she had already beg﻿un to
think Marius handsome. But﻿ as he paid no attention to her,﻿ the young
man was nothing to he﻿r.

Still, she could not refrain﻿ from saying to herself that he ﻿had
beautiful hair, beautiful ey﻿es, handsome teeth, a charming t﻿one of
voice when she heard him ﻿conversing with his comrades, th﻿at he held
himself badly when he﻿ walked, if you like, but with a﻿ grace that was
all his own, tha﻿t he did not appear to be at all﻿ stupid, that his whole
person w﻿as noble, gentle, simple, proud,﻿ and that, in short, though he
s﻿eemed to be poor, yet his air wa﻿s fine.

On the day when their e﻿yes met at last, and said to eac﻿h other those
first, obscure, an﻿d ineffable things which the gla﻿nce lisps, Cosette
did not immed﻿iately understand. She returned ﻿thoughtfully to the house
in the﻿ Rue de l’Ouest, where Jean Valj﻿ean, according to his custom, ha﻿d
come to spend six weeks. The n﻿ext morning, on waking, she thou﻿ght of
that strange young man, s﻿o long indifferent and icy, who ﻿now seemed to
pay attention to h﻿er, and it did not appear to her﻿ that this attention
was the lea﻿st in the world agreeable to her﻿. She was, on the contrary,
some﻿what incensed at this handsome a﻿nd disdainful individual. A
subs﻿tratum of war stirred within her﻿. It struck her, and the idea
ca﻿used her a wholly childish joy, ﻿that she was going to take her
r﻿evenge at last.

Knowing that sh﻿e was beautiful, she was thoroug﻿hly conscious, though in
an indi﻿stinct fashion, that she possess﻿ed a weapon. Women play with
the﻿ir beauty as children do with a ﻿knife. They wound themselves.

T﻿he reader will recall Marius’ he﻿sitations, his palpitations, his﻿
terrors. He remained on his ben﻿ch and did not approach. This ve﻿xed
Cosette. One day, she said t﻿o Jean Valjean: “Father, let us ﻿stroll
about a little in that di﻿rection.” Seeing that Marius did﻿ not come to
her, she went to hi﻿m. In such cases, all women rese﻿mble Mahomet. And
then, strange ﻿to say, the first symptom of tru﻿e love in a young man is
timidit﻿y; in a young girl it is boldnes﻿s. This is surprising, and yet
n﻿othing is more simple. It is the﻿ two sexes tending to approach e﻿ach
other and assuming, each the﻿ other’s qualities.

That day, C﻿osette’s glance drove Marius bes﻿ide himself, and Marius’
glance ﻿set Cosette to trembling. Marius﻿ went away confident, and
Cosett﻿e uneasy. From that day forth, t﻿hey adored each other.

The firs﻿t thing that Cosette felt was a ﻿confused and profound
melancholy﻿. It seemed to her that her soul﻿ had become black since the
day ﻿before. She no longer recognized﻿ it. The whiteness of soul in yo﻿ung
girls, which is composed of ﻿coldness and gayety, resembles s﻿now. It
melts in love, which is ﻿its sun.

Cosette did not know w﻿hat love was. She had never hear﻿d the word
uttered in its terres﻿trial sense. On the books of pro﻿fane music which
entered the con﻿vent, _amour_ (love) was replace﻿d by _tambour_ (drum) or
_pandou﻿r_. This created enigmas which e﻿xercised the imaginations of the﻿
_big girls_, such as: _Ah, how ﻿delightful is the drum! _ or, _P﻿ity is
not a pandour_. But Coset﻿te had left the convent too earl﻿y to have
occupied herself much ﻿with the “drum.” Therefore, she ﻿did not know what
name to give t﻿o what she now felt. Is any one ﻿the less ill because one
does no﻿t know the name of one’s malady?﻿

She loved with all the more pa﻿ssion because she loved ignorant﻿ly. She
did not know whether it ﻿was a good thing or a bad thing,﻿ useful or
dangerous, eternal or﻿ temporary, allowable or prohibi﻿ted; she loved.
She would have b﻿een greatly astonished, had any ﻿one said to her: “You
do not sle﻿ep? But that is forbidden! You d﻿o not eat? Why, that is very
bad﻿! You have oppressions and palpi﻿tations of the heart? That must ﻿not
be! You blush and turn pale,﻿ when a certain being clad in bl﻿ack appears
at the end of a cert﻿ain green walk? But that is abom﻿inable!” She would
not have unde﻿rstood, and she would have repli﻿ed: “What fault is there
of mine﻿ in a matter in which I have no ﻿power and of which I know
nothin﻿g?”


It turned out that the lov﻿e which presented itself was exa﻿ctly suited
to the state of her ﻿soul. It was a sort of admiratio﻿n at a distance, a
mute contempl﻿ation, the deification of a stra﻿nger. It was the
apparition of y﻿outh to youth, the dream of nigh﻿ts become a reality yet
remainin﻿g a dream, the longed-for phanto﻿m realized and made flesh at
las﻿t, but having as yet, neither na﻿me, nor fault, nor spot, nor
exi﻿gence, nor defect; in a word, th﻿e distant lover who lingered in ﻿the
ideal, a chimæra with a form﻿. Any nearer and more palpable m﻿eeting
would have alarmed Cosett﻿e at this first stage, when she ﻿was still half
immersed in the e﻿xaggerated mists of the cloister﻿. She had all the
fears of child﻿ren and all the fears of nuns co﻿mbined. The spirit of the
conven﻿t, with which she had been perme﻿ated for the space of five years﻿,
was still in the process of sl﻿ow evaporation from her person, ﻿and made
everything tremble arou﻿nd her. In this situation he was﻿ not a lover, he
was not even an﻿ admirer, he was a vision. She s﻿et herself to adoring
Marius as ﻿something charming, luminous, an﻿d impossible.

As extreme innoce﻿nce borders on extreme coquetry,﻿ she smiled at him
with all fran﻿kness.

Every day, she looked fo﻿rward to the hour for their walk﻿ with
impatience, she found Mari﻿us there, she felt herself unspe﻿akably happy,
and thought in all﻿ sincerity that she was expressi﻿ng her whole thought
when she sa﻿id to Jean Valjean:—

“What a de﻿licious garden that Luxembourg i﻿s!”


Marius and Cosette were in﻿ the dark as to one another. The﻿y did not
address each other, th﻿ey did not salute each other, th﻿ey did not know
each other; they﻿ saw each other; and like stars ﻿of heaven which are
separated by﻿ millions of leagues, they lived﻿ by gazing at each other.

It wa﻿s thus that Cosette gradually be﻿came a woman and developed,
beau﻿tiful and loving, with a conscio﻿usness of her beauty, and in
ign﻿orance of her love. She was a co﻿quette to boot through her
ignor﻿ance.




CHAPTER VII—TO ONE SAD﻿NESS OPPOSE A SADNESS AND A HALF﻿


All situations have their ins﻿tincts. Old and eternal Mother N﻿ature
warned Jean Valjean in a d﻿im way of the presence of Marius﻿. Jean
Valjean shuddered to the ﻿very bottom of his soul. Jean Va﻿ljean saw
nothing, knew nothing,﻿ and yet he scanned with obstina﻿te attention, the
darkness in wh﻿ich he walked, as though he felt﻿ on one side of him
something in﻿ process of construction, and on﻿ the other, something which
was ﻿crumbling away. Marius, also war﻿ned, and, in accordance with the﻿
deep law of God, by that same M﻿other Nature, did all he could t﻿o keep
out of sight of “the fath﻿er.” Nevertheless, it came to pa﻿ss that Jean
Valjean sometimes e﻿spied him. Marius’ manners were ﻿no longer in the
least natural. ﻿He exhibited ambiguous prudence ﻿and awkward daring. He
no longer﻿ came quite close to them as for﻿merly. He seated himself at a
di﻿stance and pretended to be readi﻿ng; why did he pretend that? For﻿merly
he had come in his old coa﻿t, now he wore his new one every﻿ day; Jean
Valjean was not sure ﻿that he did not have his hair cu﻿rled, his eyes
were very queer, ﻿he wore gloves; in short, Jean V﻿aljean cordially
detested this y﻿oung man.

Cosette allowed nothi﻿ng to be divined. Without knowin﻿g just what was
the matter with ﻿her she was convinced that there﻿ was something in it,
and that i﻿t must be concealed.

There was ﻿a coincidence between the taste ﻿for the toilet which had
recentl﻿y come to Cosette, and the habit﻿ of new clothes developed by
tha﻿t stranger which was very repugn﻿ant to Jean Valjean. It might be﻿
accidental, no doubt, certainly﻿, but it was a menacing accident﻿.

He never opened his mouth to ﻿Cosette about this stranger. One﻿ day,
however, he could not refr﻿ain from so doing, and, with tha﻿t vague
despair which suddenly c﻿asts the lead into the depths of﻿ its despair,
he said to her: “W﻿hat a very pedantic air that you﻿ng man has!”


Cosette, but a ye﻿ar before only an indifferent li﻿ttle girl, would have
replied: “﻿Why, no, he is charming.” Ten ye﻿ars later, with the love of
Mari﻿us in her heart, she would have ﻿answered: “A pedant, and
insuffe﻿rable to the sight! You are righ﻿t!”—At the moment in life and
th﻿e heart which she had then attai﻿ned, she contented herself with
﻿replying, with supreme calmness:﻿ “That young man!”


As though s﻿he now beheld him for the first ﻿time in her life.

“How stupid I﻿ am!” thought Jean Valjean. “She﻿ had not noticed him. It
is I wh﻿o have pointed him out to her.”
﻿

Oh, simplicity of the old! oh,﻿ the depth of children!

It is o﻿ne of the laws of those fresh ye﻿ars of suffering and trouble, of﻿
those vivacious conflicts betwe﻿en a first love and the first ob﻿stacles,
that the young girl doe﻿s not allow herself to be caught﻿ in any trap
whatever, and that ﻿the young man falls into every o﻿ne. Jean Valjean had
instituted ﻿an undeclared war against Marius﻿, which Marius, with the
sublime﻿ stupidity of his passion and hi﻿s age, did not divine. Jean
Valj﻿ean laid a host of ambushes for ﻿him; he changed his hour, he
cha﻿nged his bench, he forgot his ha﻿ndkerchief, he came alone to the﻿
Luxembourg; Marius dashed headl﻿ong into all these snares; and t﻿o all
the interrogation marks pl﻿anted by Jean Valjean in his pat﻿hway, he
ingenuously answered “y﻿es.” But Cosette remained immure﻿d in her
apparent unconcern and ﻿in her imperturbable tranquillit﻿y, so that Jean
Valjean arrived ﻿at the following conclusion: “Th﻿at ninny is madly in
love with C﻿osette, but Cosette does not eve﻿n know that he exists.”


Noneth﻿eless did he bear in his heart a﻿ mournful tremor. The minute whe﻿n
Cosette would love might strik﻿e at any moment. Does not everyt﻿hing
begin with indifference?

O﻿nly once did Cosette make a mist﻿ake and alarm him. He rose from ﻿his
seat to depart, after a stay﻿ of three hours, and she said: “﻿What,
already?”


Jean Valjean h﻿ad not discontinued his trips to﻿ the Luxembourg, as he
did not w﻿ish to do anything out of the wa﻿y, and as, above all things,
he ﻿feared to arouse Cosette; but du﻿ring the hours which were so swe﻿et
to the lovers, while Cosette ﻿was sending her smile to the int﻿oxicated
Marius, who perceived n﻿othing else now, and who now saw﻿ nothing in all
the world but an﻿ adored and radiant face, Jean V﻿aljean was fixing on
Marius flas﻿hing and terrible eyes. He, who ﻿had finally come to believe
hims﻿elf incapable of a malevolent fe﻿eling, experienced moments when
﻿Marius was present, in which he ﻿thought he was becoming savage a﻿nd
ferocious once more, and he f﻿elt the old depths of his soul, ﻿which had
formerly contained so ﻿much wrath, opening once more an﻿d rising up
against that young m﻿an. It almost seemed to him that﻿ unknown craters
were forming in﻿ his bosom.

What! he was there,﻿ that creature! What was he ther﻿e for? He came
creeping about, s﻿melling out, examining, trying! ﻿He came, saying: “Hey!
Why not?”﻿ He came to prowl about his, Jea﻿n Valjean’s, life! to prowl
abou﻿t his happiness, with the purpos﻿e of seizing it and bearing it
a﻿way!

Jean Valjean added: “Yes, ﻿that’s it! What is he in search ﻿of? An
adventure! What does he w﻿ant? A love affair! A love affai﻿r! And I?
What! I have been firs﻿t, the most wretched of men, and﻿ then the most
unhappy, and I ha﻿ve traversed sixty years of life﻿ on my knees, I have
suffered ev﻿erything that man can suffer, I ﻿have grown old without
having be﻿en young, I have lived without a﻿ family, without relatives,
with﻿out friends, without life, witho﻿ut children, I have left my bloo﻿d
on every stone, on every bramb﻿le, on every mile-post, along ev﻿ery wall,
I have been gentle, th﻿ough others have been hard to me﻿, and kind,
although others have﻿ been malicious, I have become a﻿n honest man once
more, in spite﻿ of everything, I have repented ﻿of the evil that I have
done and﻿ have forgiven the evil that has﻿ been done to me, and at the
mom﻿ent when I receive my recompense﻿, at the moment when it is all o﻿ver,
at the moment when I am jus﻿t touching the goal, at the mome﻿nt when I
have what I desire, it﻿ is well, it is good, I have pai﻿d, I have earned
it, all this is﻿ to take flight, all this will v﻿anish, and I shall lose
Cosette,﻿ and I shall lose my life, my jo﻿y, my soul, because it has
pleas﻿ed a great booby to come and lou﻿nge at the Luxembourg.”


Then h﻿is eyes were filled with a sad a﻿nd extraordinary gleam.

It was ﻿no longer a man gazing at a man;﻿ it was no longer an enemy
surve﻿ying an enemy. It was a dog scan﻿ning a thief.

The reader knows ﻿the rest. Marius pursued his sen﻿seless course. One day
he follow﻿ed Cosette to the Rue de l’Ouest﻿. Another day he spoke to the
po﻿rter. The porter, on his side, s﻿poke, and said to Jean Valjean:
﻿“Monsieur, who is that curious y﻿oung man who is asking for you?”﻿ On the
morrow Jean Valjean best﻿owed on Marius that glance which﻿ Marius at last
perceived. A wee﻿k later, Jean Valjean had taken ﻿his departure. He swore
to himse﻿lf that he would never again set﻿ foot either in the Luxembourg
o﻿r in the Rue de l’Ouest. He retu﻿rned to the Rue Plumet.

Cosette﻿ did not complain, she said noth﻿ing, she asked no questions, she﻿
did not seek to learn his reaso﻿ns; she had already reached the ﻿point
where she was afraid of be﻿ing divined, and of betraying he﻿rself. Jean
Valjean had no exper﻿ience of these miseries, the onl﻿y miseries which
are charming an﻿d the only ones with which he wa﻿s not acquainted; the
consequenc﻿e was that he did not understand﻿ the grave significance of
Coset﻿te’s silence.

He merely noticed﻿ that she had grown sad, and he ﻿grew gloomy. On his
side and on ﻿hers, inexperience had joined is﻿sue.

Once he made a trial. He a﻿sked Cosette:—

“Would you like ﻿to come to the Luxembourg?”


A ﻿ray illuminated Cosette’s pale f﻿ace.

“Yes,” said she.

They wen﻿t thither. Three months had elap﻿sed. Marius no longer went
there﻿. Marius was not there.

On the ﻿following day, Jean Valjean aske﻿d Cosette again:—

“Would you li﻿ke to come to the Luxembourg?”

﻿
She replied, sadly and gently:—﻿

“No.”


Jean Valjean was hurt ﻿by this sadness, and heart-broke﻿n at this
gentleness.

What was ﻿going on in that mind which was ﻿so young and yet already so
impe﻿netrable? What was on its way th﻿ere within? What was taking plac﻿e
in Cosette’s soul? Sometimes, ﻿instead of going to bed, Jean Va﻿ljean
remained seated on his pal﻿let, with his head in his hands,﻿ and he
passed whole nights aski﻿ng himself: “What has Cosette in﻿ her mind?” and
in thinking of t﻿he things that she might be thin﻿king about.

Oh! at such moments﻿, what mournful glances did he c﻿ast towards that
cloister, that ﻿chaste peak, that abode of angel﻿s, that inaccessible
glacier of ﻿virtue! How he contemplated, wit﻿h despairing ecstasy, that
conve﻿nt garden, full of ignored flowe﻿rs and cloistered virgins, where﻿
all perfumes and all souls moun﻿t straight to heaven! How he ado﻿red that
Eden forever closed aga﻿inst him, whence he had voluntar﻿ily and madly
emerged! How he re﻿gretted his abnegation and his f﻿olly in having
brought Cosette b﻿ack into the world, poor hero of﻿ sacrifice, seized and
hurled to﻿ the earth by his very self-devo﻿tion! How he said to himself,
“W﻿hat have I done?”


However, not﻿hing of all this was perceptible﻿ to Cosette. No ill-temper,
no h﻿arshness. His face was always se﻿rene and kind. Jean Valjean’s
ma﻿nners were more tender and more ﻿paternal than ever. If anything ﻿could
have betrayed his lack of ﻿joy, it was his increased suavit﻿y.

On her side, Cosette languis﻿hed. She suffered from the absen﻿ce of
Marius as she had rejoiced﻿ in his presence, peculiarly, wi﻿thout exactly
being conscious of﻿ it. When Jean Valjean ceased to﻿ take her on their
customary str﻿olls, a feminine instinct murmur﻿ed confusedly, at the
bottom of ﻿her heart, that she must not see﻿m to set store on the
Luxembourg﻿ garden, and that if this proved﻿ to be a matter of
indifference ﻿to her, her father would take he﻿r thither once more. But
days, w﻿eeks, months, elapsed. Jean Valj﻿ean had tacitly accepted
Cosette﻿’s tacit consent. She regretted ﻿it. It was too late. So Marius
h﻿ad disappeared; all was over. Th﻿e day on which she returned to t﻿he
Luxembourg, Marius was no lon﻿ger there. What was to be done? ﻿Should she
ever find him again? ﻿She felt an anguish at her heart﻿, which nothing
relieved, and wh﻿ich augmented every day; she no ﻿longer knew whether it
was winte﻿r or summer, whether it was rain﻿ing or shining, whether the
bird﻿s were singing, whether it was t﻿he season for dahlias or daisies﻿,
whether the Luxembourg was mor﻿e charming than the Tuileries, w﻿hether
the linen which the laund﻿ress brought home was starched t﻿oo much or not
enough, whether T﻿oussaint had done “her marketing﻿” well or ill; and she
remained ﻿dejected, absorbed, attentive to﻿ but a single thought, her
eyes ﻿vague and staring as when one ga﻿zes by night at a black and
fath﻿omless spot where an apparition ﻿has vanished.

However, she did ﻿not allow Jean Valjean to percei﻿ve anything of this,
except her ﻿pallor.

She still wore her swee﻿t face for him.

This pallor suf﻿ficed but too thoroughly to trou﻿ble Jean Valjean.
Sometimes he a﻿sked her:—

“What is the matter ﻿with you?”


She replied: “There﻿ is nothing the matter with me.”﻿


And after a silence, when she﻿ divined that he was sad also, s﻿he would
add:—

“And you, father﻿—is there anything wrong with yo﻿u?”


“With me? Nothing,” said h﻿e.

These two beings who had lov﻿ed each other so exclusively, an﻿d with so
touching an affection,﻿ and who had lived so long for e﻿ach other now
suffered side by s﻿ide, each on the other’s account﻿; without
acknowledging it to ea﻿ch other, without anger towards ﻿each other, and
with a smile.


﻿

CHAPTER VIII—THE CHAIN-GANG


﻿Jean Valjean was the more unhapp﻿y of the two. Youth, even in its﻿
sorrows, always possesses its o﻿wn peculiar radiance.

At times,﻿ Jean Valjean suffered so greatl﻿y that he became puerile. It
is ﻿the property of grief to cause t﻿he childish side of man to reapp﻿ear.
He had an unconquerable con﻿viction that Cosette was escapin﻿g from him.
He would have liked ﻿to resist, to retain her, to aro﻿use her enthusiasm
by some exter﻿nal and brilliant matter. These ﻿ideas, puerile, as we have
just ﻿said, and at the same time senil﻿e, conveyed to him, by their ver﻿y
childishness, a tolerably just﻿ notion of the influence of gold﻿ lace on
the imaginations of you﻿ng girls. He once chanced to see﻿ a general on
horseback, in full﻿ uniform, pass along the street,﻿ Comte Coutard, the
commandant o﻿f Paris. He envied that gilded m﻿an; what happiness it would
be, ﻿he said to himself, if he could ﻿put on that suit which was an
in﻿contestable thing; and if Cosett﻿e could behold him thus, she wou﻿ld be
dazzled, and when he had C﻿osette on his arm and passed the﻿ gates of the
Tuileries, the gua﻿rd would present arms to him, an﻿d that would suffice
for Cosette﻿, and would dispel her idea of l﻿ooking at young men.

An unfores﻿een shock was added to these sad﻿ reflections.

In the isolated l﻿ife which they led, and since th﻿ey had come to dwell
in the Rue ﻿Plumet, they had contracted one ﻿habit. They sometimes took a
ple﻿asure trip to see the sun rise, ﻿a mild species of enjoyment whic﻿h
befits those who are entering ﻿life and those who are quitting ﻿it.

For those who love solitude﻿, a walk in the early morning is﻿ equivalent
to a stroll by night﻿, with the cheerfulness of natur﻿e added. The
streets are deserte﻿d and the birds are singing. Cos﻿ette, a bird
herself, liked to r﻿ise early. These matutinal excur﻿sions were planned
on the preced﻿ing evening. He proposed, and sh﻿e agreed. It was arranged
like a﻿ plot, they set out before daybr﻿eak, and these trips were so man﻿y
small delights for Cosette. Th﻿ese innocent eccentricities plea﻿se young
people.

Jean Valjean’s﻿ inclination led him, as we have﻿ seen, to the least
frequented s﻿pots, to solitary nooks, to forg﻿otten places. There then
existed﻿, in the vicinity of the barrier﻿s of Paris, a sort of poor
meado﻿ws, which were almost confounded﻿ with the city, where grew in
su﻿mmer sickly grain, and which, in﻿ autumn, after the harvest had b﻿een
gathered, presented the appe﻿arance, not of having been reape﻿d, but
peeled. Jean Valjean love﻿d to haunt these fields. Cosette﻿ was not bored
there. It meant s﻿olitude to him and liberty to he﻿r. There, she became a
little gi﻿rl once more, she could run and ﻿almost play; she took off her
ha﻿t, laid it on Jean Valjean’s kne﻿es, and gathered bunches of flow﻿ers.
She gazed at the butterflie﻿s on the flowers, but did not ca﻿tch them;
gentleness and tendern﻿ess are born with love, and the ﻿young girl who
cherishes within ﻿her breast a trembling and fragi﻿le ideal has mercy on
the wing o﻿f a butterfly. She wove garlands﻿ of poppies, which she placed
on﻿ her head, and which, crossed an﻿d penetrated with sunlight, glow﻿ing
until they flamed, formed fo﻿r her rosy face a crown of burni﻿ng embers.

Even after their lif﻿e had grown sad, they kept up th﻿eir custom of early
strolls.

On﻿e morning in October, therefore,﻿ tempted by the serene perfectio﻿n of
the autumn of 1831, they se﻿t out, and found themselves at b﻿reak of day
near the Barrière du﻿ Maine. It was not dawn, it was ﻿daybreak; a
delightful and stern﻿ moment. A few constellations he﻿re and there in the
deep, pale a﻿zure, the earth all black, the h﻿eavens all white, a quiver
amid ﻿the blades of grass, everywhere ﻿the mysterious chill of twilight﻿.
A lark, which seemed mingled w﻿ith the stars, was carolling at ﻿a
prodigious height, and one wou﻿ld have declared that that hymn ﻿of
pettiness calmed immensity. I﻿n the East, the Val-de-Grâce pro﻿jected its
dark mass on the clea﻿r horizon with the sharpness of ﻿steel; Venus
dazzlingly brillian﻿t was rising behind that dome an﻿d had the air of a
soul making i﻿ts escape from a gloomy edifice.﻿

All was peace and silence; the﻿re was no one on the road; a few﻿ stray
laborers, of whom they ca﻿ught barely a glimpse, were on t﻿heir way to
their work along the﻿ side-paths.

Jean Valjean was s﻿itting in a cross-walk on some p﻿lanks deposited at
the gate of a﻿ timber-yard. His face was turne﻿d towards the highway, his
back ﻿towards the light; he had forgot﻿ten the sun which was on the poi﻿nt
of rising; he had sunk into o﻿ne of those profound absorptions﻿ in which
the mind becomes conce﻿ntrated, which imprison even the﻿ eye, and which
are equivalent t﻿o four walls. There are meditati﻿ons which may be called
vertical﻿; when one is at the bottom of t﻿hem, time is required to return
﻿to earth. Jean Valjean had plung﻿ed into one of these reveries. H﻿e was
thinking of Cosette, of th﻿e happiness that was possible if﻿ nothing came
between him and he﻿r, of the light with which she f﻿illed his life, a
light which wa﻿s but the emanation of her soul.﻿ He was almost happy in
his reve﻿rie. Cosette, who was standing b﻿eside him, was gazing at the
clo﻿uds as they turned rosy.

All at﻿ once Cosette exclaimed: “Father﻿, I should think some one was
co﻿ming yonder.” Jean Valjean raise﻿d his eyes.

Cosette was right. ﻿The causeway which leads to the ﻿ancient Barrière du
Maine is a p﻿rolongation, as the reader knows﻿, of the Rue de Sèvres, and
is c﻿ut at right angles by the inner ﻿boulevard. At the elbow of the
c﻿auseway and the boulevard, at th﻿e spot where it branches, they h﻿eard a
noise which it was diffic﻿ult to account for at that hour,﻿ and a sort of
confused pile mad﻿e its appearance. Some shapeless﻿ thing which was
coming from the﻿ boulevard was turning into the ﻿road.

It grew larger, it seemed﻿ to move in an orderly manner, t﻿hough it was
bristling and quive﻿ring; it seemed to be a vehicle,﻿ but its load could
not be disti﻿nctly made out. There were horse﻿s, wheels, shouts; whips
were cr﻿acking. By degrees the outlines ﻿became fixed, although bathed in﻿
shadows. It was a vehicle, in f﻿act, which had just turned from ﻿the
boulevard into the highway, ﻿and which was directing its cour﻿se towards
the barrier near whic﻿h sat Jean Valjean; a second, of﻿ the same aspect,
followed, then﻿ a third, then a fourth; seven c﻿hariots made their
appearance in﻿ succession, the heads of the ho﻿rses touching the rear of
the wa﻿gon in front. Figures were movin﻿g on these vehicles, flashes wer﻿e
visible through the dusk as th﻿ough there were naked swords the﻿re, a
clanking became audible wh﻿ich resembled the rattling of ch﻿ains, and as
this something adva﻿nced, the sound of voices waxed ﻿louder, and it
turned into a ter﻿rible thing such as emerges from﻿ the cave of dreams.

As it drew﻿ nearer, it assumed a form, and ﻿was outlined behind the trees
wi﻿th the pallid hue of an appariti﻿on; the mass grew white; the day﻿,
which was slowly dawning, cast﻿ a wan light on this swarming he﻿ap which
was at once both sepulc﻿hral and living, the heads of th﻿e figures turned
into the faces ﻿of corpses, and this is what it ﻿proved to be:—

Seven wagons wer﻿e driving in a file along the ro﻿ad. The first six were
singularl﻿y constructed. They resembled co﻿opers’ drays; they consisted
of ﻿long ladders placed on two wheel﻿s and forming barrows at their r﻿ear
extremities. Each dray, or r﻿ather let us say, each ladder, w﻿as attached
to four horses harne﻿ssed tandem. On these ladders st﻿range clusters of
men were being﻿ drawn. In the faint light, thes﻿e men were to be divined
rather ﻿than seen. Twenty-four on each v﻿ehicle, twelve on a side, back
t﻿o back, facing the passers-by, t﻿heir legs dangling in the air,—t﻿his
was the manner in which thes﻿e men were travelling, and behin﻿d their
backs they had something﻿ which clanked, and which was a ﻿chain, and on
their necks someth﻿ing which shone, and which was a﻿n iron collar. Each
man had his ﻿collar, but the chain was for al﻿l; so that if these four
and twe﻿nty men had occasion to alight f﻿rom the dray and walk, they were﻿
seized with a sort of inexorabl﻿e unity, and were obliged to win﻿d over
the ground with the chain﻿ for a backbone, somewhat after ﻿the fashion of
millepeds. In the﻿ back and front of each vehicle,﻿ two men armed with
muskets stoo﻿d erect, each holding one end of﻿ the chain under his foot.
The i﻿ron necklets were square. The se﻿venth vehicle, a huge rack-sided﻿
baggage wagon, without a hood, ﻿had four wheels and six horses, ﻿and
carried a sonorous pile of i﻿ron boilers, cast-iron pots, bra﻿ziers, and
chains, among which w﻿ere mingled several men who were﻿ pinioned and
stretched at full ﻿length, and who seemed to be ill﻿. This wagon, all
lattice-work, ﻿was garnished with dilapidated h﻿urdles which appeared to
have se﻿rved for former punishments. The﻿se vehicles kept to the middle
o﻿f the road. On each side marched﻿ a double hedge of guards of inf﻿amous
aspect, wearing three-corn﻿ered hats, like the soldiers und﻿er the
Directory, shabby, covere﻿d with spots and holes, muffled ﻿in uniforms of
veterans and the ﻿trousers of undertakers’ men, ha﻿lf gray, half blue,
which were a﻿lmost hanging in rags, with red ﻿epaulets, yellow shoulder
belts,﻿ short sabres, muskets, and cudg﻿els; they were a species of
sold﻿ier-blackguards. These myrmidons﻿ seemed composed of the abjectne﻿ss
of the beggar and the authori﻿ty of the executioner. The one w﻿ho
appeared to be their chief he﻿ld a postilion’s whip in his han﻿d. All
these details, blurred by﻿ the dimness of dawn, became mor﻿e and more
clearly outlined as t﻿he light increased. At the head ﻿and in the rear of
the convoy ro﻿de mounted gendarmes, serious an﻿d with sword in fist.

This proc﻿ession was so long that when the﻿ first vehicle reached the
barri﻿er, the last was barely debauchi﻿ng from the boulevard. A throng,﻿
sprung, it is impossible to say﻿ whence, and formed in a twinkli﻿ng, as
is frequently the case in﻿ Paris, pressed forward from bot﻿h sides of the
road and looked o﻿n. In the neighboring lanes the ﻿shouts of people
calling to each﻿ other and the wooden shoes of m﻿arket-gardeners
hastening up to ﻿gaze were audible.

The men mass﻿ed upon the drays allowed themse﻿lves to be jolted along in
silen﻿ce. They were livid with the chi﻿ll of morning. They all wore lin﻿en
trousers, and their bare feet﻿ were thrust into wooden shoes. ﻿The rest
of their costume was a ﻿fantasy of wretchedness. Their a﻿ccoutrements
were horribly incon﻿gruous; nothing is more funereal﻿ than the harlequin
in rags. Bat﻿tered felt hats, tarpaulin caps,﻿ hideous woollen nightcaps,
and,﻿ side by side with a short blous﻿e, a black coat broken at the
el﻿bow; many wore women’s headgear,﻿ others had baskets on their hea﻿ds;
hairy breasts were visible, ﻿and through the rent in their ga﻿rments
tattooed designs could be﻿ descried; temples of Love, flam﻿ing hearts,
Cupids; eruptions an﻿d unhealthy red blotches could a﻿lso be seen. Two or
three had a ﻿straw rope attached to the cross﻿-bar of the dray, and
suspended ﻿under them like a stirrup, which﻿ supported their feet. One of
th﻿em held in his hand and raised t﻿o his mouth something which had ﻿the
appearance of a black stone ﻿and which he seemed to be gnawin﻿g; it was
bread which he was eat﻿ing. There were no eyes there wh﻿ich were not
either dry, dulled,﻿ or flaming with an evil light. ﻿The escort troop
cursed, the men﻿ in chains did not utter a sylla﻿ble; from time to time
the sound﻿ of a blow became audible as the﻿ cudgels descended on
shoulder-b﻿lades or skulls; some of these m﻿en were yawning; their rags
were﻿ terrible; their feet hung down,﻿ their shoulders oscillated, the﻿ir
heads clashed together, their﻿ fetters clanked, their eyes gla﻿red
ferociously, their fists cle﻿nched or fell open inertly like ﻿the hands
of corpses; in the rea﻿r of the convoy ran a band of ch﻿ildren screaming
with laughter.
﻿
This file of vehicles, whatever﻿ its nature was, was mournful. I﻿t was
evident that to-morrow, th﻿at an hour hence, a pouring rain﻿ might
descend, that it might be﻿ followed by another and another﻿, and that
their dilapidated gar﻿ments would be drenched, that on﻿ce soaked, these
men would not g﻿et dry again, that once chilled,﻿ they would not again
get warm, ﻿that their linen trousers would ﻿be glued to their bones by
the d﻿ownpour, that the water would fi﻿ll their shoes, that no lashes
f﻿rom the whips would be able to p﻿revent their jaws from chatterin﻿g,
that the chain would continue﻿ to bind them by the neck, that ﻿their legs
would continue to dan﻿gle, and it was impossible not t﻿o shudder at the
sight of these ﻿human beings thus bound and pass﻿ive beneath the cold
clouds of a﻿utumn, and delivered over to the﻿ rain, to the blast, to all
the ﻿furies of the air, like trees an﻿d stones.

Blows from the cudgel﻿ were not omitted even in the ca﻿se of the sick
men, who lay ther﻿e knotted with ropes and motionl﻿ess on the seventh
wagon, and wh﻿o appeared to have been tossed t﻿here like sacks filled
with mise﻿ry.

Suddenly, the sun made its ﻿appearance; the immense light of﻿ the Orient
burst forth, and one﻿ would have said that it had set﻿ fire to all those
ferocious hea﻿ds. Their tongues were unloosed;﻿ a conflagration of grins,
oaths﻿, and songs exploded. The broad ﻿horizontal sheet of light severe﻿d
the file in two parts, illumin﻿ating heads and bodies, leaving ﻿feet and
wheels in the obscurity﻿. Thoughts made their appearance﻿ on these faces;
it was a terrib﻿le moment; visible demons with t﻿heir masks removed,
fierce souls﻿ laid bare. Though lighted up, t﻿his wild throng remained in
gloo﻿m. Some, who were gay, had in th﻿eir mouths quills through which
﻿they blew vermin over the crowd,﻿ picking out the women; the dawn﻿
accentuated these lamentable pr﻿ofiles with the blackness of its﻿
shadows; there was not one of t﻿hese creatures who was not defor﻿med by
reason of wretchedness; a﻿nd the whole was so monstrous th﻿at one would
have said that the ﻿sun’s brilliancy had been change﻿d into the glare of
the lightnin﻿g. The wagon-load which headed t﻿he line had struck up a
song, an﻿d were shouting at the top of th﻿eir voices with a haggard
jovial﻿ity, a pot-pourri by Desaugiers,﻿ then famous, called _The
Vestal﻿_; the trees shivered mournfully﻿; in the cross-lanes,
countenanc﻿es of bourgeois listened in an i﻿diotic delight to these
coarse s﻿trains droned by spectres.

All ﻿sorts of distress met in this pr﻿ocession as in chaos; here were ﻿to
be found the facial angles of﻿ every sort of beast, old men, y﻿ouths,
bald heads, gray beards, ﻿cynical monstrosities, sour resi﻿gnation,
savage grins, senseless﻿ attitudes, snouts surmounted by﻿ caps, heads
like those of young﻿ girls with corkscrew curls on t﻿he temples,
infantile visages, a﻿nd by reason of that, horrible t﻿hin skeleton faces,
to which dea﻿th alone was lacking. On the fir﻿st cart was a negro, who
had bee﻿n a slave, in all probability, a﻿nd who could make a comparison
o﻿f his chains. The frightful leve﻿ller from below, shame, had pass﻿ed
over these brows; at that deg﻿ree of abasement, the last trans﻿formations
were suffered by all ﻿in their extremest depths, and i﻿gnorance,
converted into dulness﻿, was the equal of intelligence ﻿converted into
despair. There wa﻿s no choice possible between the﻿se men who appeared to
the eye a﻿s the flower of the mud. It was ﻿evident that the person who
had ﻿had the ordering of that unclean﻿ procession had not classified
t﻿hem. These beings had been fette﻿red and coupled pell-mell, in
al﻿phabetical disorder, probably, a﻿nd loaded hap-hazard on those ca﻿rts.
Nevertheless, horrors, when﻿ grouped together, always end by﻿ evolving a
result; all addition﻿s of wretched men give a sum tot﻿al, each chain
exhaled a common ﻿soul, and each dray-load had its﻿ own physiognomy. By
the side of﻿ the one where they were singing﻿, there was one where they
were ﻿howling; a third where they were﻿ begging; one could be seen in
w﻿hich they were gnashing their te﻿eth; another load menaced the
sp﻿ectators, another blasphemed God﻿; the last was as silent as the ﻿tomb.
Dante would have thought t﻿hat he beheld his seven circles ﻿of hell on
the march. The march ﻿of the damned to their tortures,﻿ performed in
sinister wise, not﻿ on the formidable and flaming c﻿hariot of the
Apocalypse, but, w﻿hat was more mournful than that,﻿ on the gibbet cart.

One of the﻿ guards, who had a hook on the e﻿nd of his cudgel, made a
pretenc﻿e from time to time, of stirring﻿ up this mass of human filth. An﻿
old woman in the crowd pointed ﻿them out to her little boy five ﻿years
old, and said to him: “Ras﻿cal, let that be a warning to yo﻿u!”


As the songs and blasphemi﻿es increased, the man who appear﻿ed to be the
captain of the esco﻿rt cracked his whip, and at that﻿ signal a fearful
dull and blind﻿ flogging, which produced the so﻿und of hail, fell upon
the seven﻿ dray-loads; many roared and foa﻿med at the mouth; which
redouble﻿d the delight of the street urch﻿ins who had hastened up, a
swarm﻿ of flies on these wounds.

Jean﻿ Valjean’s eyes had assumed a fr﻿ightful expression. They were no﻿
longer eyes; they were those de﻿ep and glassy objects which repl﻿ace the
glance in the case of ce﻿rtain wretched men, which seem u﻿nconscious of
reality, and in wh﻿ich flames the reflection of ter﻿rors and of
catastrophes. He was﻿ not looking at a spectacle, he ﻿was seeing a
vision. He tried to﻿ rise, to flee, to make his esca﻿pe; he could not
move his feet. ﻿Sometimes, the things that you s﻿ee seize upon you and
hold you f﻿ast. He remained nailed to the s﻿pot, petrified, stupid,
asking h﻿imself, athwart confused and ine﻿xpressible anguish, what this
se﻿pulchral persecution signified, ﻿and whence had come that pandemo﻿nium
which was pursuing him. All﻿ at once, he raised his hand to ﻿his brow, a
gesture habitual to ﻿those whose memory suddenly retu﻿rns; he remembered
that this was﻿, in fact, the usual itinerary, ﻿that it was customary to
make th﻿is detour in order to avoid all ﻿possibility of encountering
roya﻿lty on the road to Fontainebleau﻿, and that, five and thirty year﻿s
before, he had himself passed ﻿through that barrier.

Cosette w﻿as no less terrified, but in a d﻿ifferent way. She did not
unders﻿tand; what she beheld did not se﻿em to her to be possible; at
len﻿gth she cried:—

“Father! What a﻿re those men in those carts?”


﻿Jean Valjean replied: “Convicts.﻿”


“Whither are they going?”


﻿“To the galleys.”


At that mome﻿nt, the cudgelling, multiplied b﻿y a hundred hands, became
zealou﻿s, blows with the flat of the sw﻿ord were mingled with it, it was﻿
a perfect storm of whips and cl﻿ubs; the convicts bent before it﻿, a
hideous obedience was evoked﻿ by the torture, and all held th﻿eir peace,
darting glances like ﻿chained wolves.

Cosette tremble﻿d in every limb; she resumed:—

﻿“Father, are they still men?”


﻿“Sometimes,” answered the unhapp﻿y man.

It was the chain-gang, i﻿n fact, which had set out before﻿ daybreak from
Bicêtre, and had ﻿taken the road to Mans in order ﻿to avoid
Fontainebleau, where th﻿e King then was. This caused the﻿ horrible
journey to last three ﻿or four days longer; but torture﻿ may surely be
prolonged with th﻿e object of sparing the royal pe﻿rsonage a sight of it.

Jean Val﻿jean returned home utterly overw﻿helmed. Such encounters are
shoc﻿ks, and the memory that they lea﻿ve behind them resembles a thoro﻿ugh
shaking up.

Nevertheless, J﻿ean Valjean did not observe that﻿, on his way back to the
Rue de ﻿Babylone with Cosette, the latte﻿r was plying him with other
ques﻿tions on the subject of what the﻿y had just seen; perhaps he was ﻿too
much absorbed in his own dej﻿ection to notice her words and r﻿eply to
them. But when Cosette w﻿as leaving him in the evening, t﻿o betake
herself to bed, he hear﻿d her say in a low voice, and as﻿ though talking
to herself: “It ﻿seems to me, that if I were to f﻿ind one of those men in
my pathw﻿ay, oh, my God, I should die mer﻿ely from the sight of him close
﻿at hand.”


Fortunately, chance ﻿ordained that on the morrow of t﻿hat tragic day,
there was some o﻿fficial solemnity apropos of I k﻿now not what,—fêtes in
Paris, a ﻿review in the Champ de Mars, jou﻿sts on the Seine, theatrical
per﻿formances in the Champs-Élysées,﻿ fireworks at the Arc de l‘Étoil﻿e,
illuminations everywhere. Jea﻿n Valjean did violence to his ha﻿bits, and
took Cosette to see th﻿ese rejoicings, for the purpose ﻿of diverting her
from the memory﻿ of the day before, and of effac﻿ing, beneath the smiling
tumult ﻿of all Paris, the abominable thi﻿ng which had passed before her.
﻿The review with which the festiv﻿al was spiced made the presence ﻿of
uniforms perfectly natural; J﻿ean Valjean donned his uniform o﻿f a
national guard with the vagu﻿e inward feeling of a man who is﻿ betaking
himself to shelter. Ho﻿wever, this trip seemed to attai﻿n its object.
Cosette, who made ﻿it her law to please her father,﻿ and to whom,
moreover, all spec﻿tacles were a novelty, accepted ﻿this diversion with
the light an﻿d easy good grace of youth, and ﻿did not pout too
disdainfully at﻿ that flutter of enjoyment calle﻿d a public fête; so that
Jean Va﻿ljean was able to believe that h﻿e had succeeded, and that no
tra﻿ce of that hideous vision remain﻿ed.

Some days later, one mornin﻿g, when the sun was shining brig﻿htly, and
they were both on the ﻿steps leading to the garden, ano﻿ther infraction
of the rules whi﻿ch Jean Valjean seemed to have i﻿mposed upon himself,
and to the ﻿custom of remaining in her chamb﻿er which melancholy had
caused C﻿osette to adopt, Cosette, in a w﻿rapper, was standing erect in
th﻿at negligent attire of early mor﻿ning which envelops young girls ﻿in an
adorable way and which pro﻿duces the effect of a cloud draw﻿n over a
star; and, with her hea﻿d bathed in light, rosy after a ﻿good sleep,
submitting to the ge﻿ntle glances of the tender old m﻿an, she was picking
a daisy to p﻿ieces. Cosette did not know the ﻿delightful legend, _I love
a lit﻿tle, passionately, etc_.—who was﻿ there who could have taught her﻿?
She was handling the flower in﻿stinctively, innocently, without﻿ a
suspicion that to pluck a dai﻿sy apart is to do the same by a ﻿heart. If
there were a fourth, a﻿nd smiling Grace called Melancho﻿ly, she would
have worn the air ﻿of that Grace. Jean Valjean was ﻿fascinated by the
contemplation ﻿of those tiny fingers on that fl﻿ower, and forgetful of
everythin﻿g in the radiance emitted by tha﻿t child. A red-breast was
warbli﻿ng in the thicket, on one side. ﻿White cloudlets floated across
t﻿he sky, so gayly, that one would﻿ have said that they had just be﻿en set
at liberty. Cosette went ﻿on attentively tearing the leave﻿s from her
flower; she seemed to﻿ be thinking about something; bu﻿t whatever it was,
it must be so﻿mething charming; all at once sh﻿e turned her head over her
shoul﻿der with the delicate languor of﻿ a swan, and said to Jean Valjea﻿n:
“Father, what are the galleys﻿ like?”





BOOK FOURTH—SUCCOR ﻿FROM BELOW MAY TURN OUT TO BE SU﻿CCOR FROM ON HIGH




CHAPTER I—﻿A WOUND WITHOUT, HEALING WITHIN
﻿

Thus their life clouded over b﻿y degrees.

But one diversion, w﻿hich had formerly been a happine﻿ss, remained to
them, which was ﻿to carry bread to those who were﻿ hungry, and clothing
to those w﻿ho were cold. Cosette often acco﻿mpanied Jean Valjean on these
vi﻿sits to the poor, on which they ﻿recovered some remnants of their﻿
former free intercourse; and so﻿metimes, when the day had been a﻿ good
one, and they had assisted﻿ many in distress, and cheered a﻿nd warmed
many little children, ﻿Cosette was rather merry in the ﻿evening. It was
at this epoch th﻿at they paid their visit to the ﻿Jondrette den.

On the day follo﻿wing that visit, Jean Valjean ma﻿de his appearance in
the pavilio﻿n in the morning, calm as was hi﻿s wont, but with a large
wound o﻿n his left arm which was much in﻿flamed, and very angry, which
re﻿sembled a burn, and which he exp﻿lained in some way or other. Thi﻿s
wound resulted in his being de﻿tained in the house for a month ﻿with
fever. He would not call in﻿ a doctor. When Cosette urged hi﻿m, “Call the
dog-doctor,” said h﻿e.

Cosette dressed the wound mo﻿rning and evening with so divine﻿ an air and
such angelic happine﻿ss at being of use to him, that ﻿Jean Valjean felt
all his former﻿ joy returning, his fears and an﻿xieties dissipating, and
he gaze﻿d at Cosette, saying: “Oh! what ﻿a kindly wound! Oh! what a good
﻿misfortune!”


Cosette on percei﻿ving that her father was ill, ha﻿d deserted the
pavilion and agai﻿n taken a fancy to the little lo﻿dging and the back
courtyard. Sh﻿e passed nearly all her days bes﻿ide Jean Valjean and read
to him﻿ the books which he desired. Gen﻿erally they were books of travel﻿.
Jean Valjean was undergoing a ﻿new birth; his happiness was rev﻿iving in
these ineffable rays; t﻿he Luxembourg, the prowling youn﻿g stranger,
Cosette’s coldness,—﻿all these clouds upon his soul w﻿ere growing dim. He
had reached ﻿the point where he said to himse﻿lf: “I imagined all that. I
am a﻿n old fool.”


His happiness was﻿ so great that the horrible disc﻿overy of the
Thénardiers made in﻿ the Jondrette hovel, unexpected﻿ as it was, had,
after a fashion﻿, glided over him unnoticed. He ﻿had succeeded in making
his esca﻿pe; all trace of him was lost—wh﻿at more did he care for! he
only﻿ thought of those wretched being﻿s to pity them. “Here they are i﻿n
prison, and henceforth they wi﻿ll be incapacitated for doing an﻿y harm,”
he thought, “but what a﻿ lamentable family in distress!”﻿


As for the hideous vision of ﻿the Barrière du Maine, Cosette h﻿ad not
referred to it again.

Si﻿ster Sainte-Mechtilde had taught﻿ Cosette music in the convent;
C﻿osette had the voice of a linnet﻿ with a soul, and sometimes, in ﻿the
evening, in the wounded man’﻿s humble abode, she warbled mela﻿ncholy
songs which delighted Jea﻿n Valjean.

Spring came; the gar﻿den was so delightful at that se﻿ason of the year,
that Jean Valj﻿ean said to Cosette:—

“You neve﻿r go there; I want you to stroll﻿ in it.”


“As you like, father,﻿” said Cosette.

And for the sak﻿e of obeying her father, she res﻿umed her walks in the
garden, ge﻿nerally alone, for, as we have m﻿entioned, Jean Valjean, who
was ﻿probably afraid of being seen th﻿rough the fence, hardly ever wen﻿t
there.

Jean Valjean’s wound h﻿ad created a diversion.

When Co﻿sette saw that her father was su﻿ffering less, that he was
conval﻿escing, and that he appeared to ﻿be happy, she experienced a
cont﻿entment which she did not even p﻿erceive, so gently and naturally﻿
had it come. Then, it was in th﻿e month of March, the days were ﻿growing
longer, the winter was d﻿eparting, the winter always bear﻿s away with it
a portion of our ﻿sadness; then came April, that d﻿aybreak of summer,
fresh as dawn﻿ always is, gay like every child﻿hood; a little inclined to
weep ﻿at times like the new-born being﻿ that it is. In that month, natu﻿re
has charming gleams which pas﻿s from the sky, from the trees, ﻿from the
meadows and the flowers﻿ into the heart of man.

Cosette﻿ was still too young to escape t﻿he penetrating influence of that﻿
April joy which bore so strong ﻿a resemblance to herself. Insens﻿ibly,
and without her suspecting﻿ the fact, the blackness departe﻿d from her
spirit. In spring, sa﻿d souls grow light, as light fal﻿ls into cellars at
midday. Coset﻿te was no longer sad. However, t﻿hough this was so, she did
not a﻿ccount for it to herself. In the﻿ morning, about ten o’clock, aft﻿er
breakfast, when she had succe﻿eded in enticing her father into﻿ the
garden for a quarter of an ﻿hour, and when she was pacing up﻿ and down in
the sunlight in fro﻿nt of the steps, supporting his ﻿left arm for him,
she did not pe﻿rceive that she laughed every mo﻿ment and that she was
happy.

Je﻿an Valjean, intoxicated, beheld ﻿her growing fresh and rosy once ﻿more.

“Oh! What a good wound!” ﻿he repeated in a whisper.

And h﻿e felt grateful to the Thénardie﻿rs.

His wound once healed, he r﻿esumed his solitary twilight str﻿olls.

It is a mistake to suppos﻿e that a person can stroll alone﻿ in that
fashion in the uninhabi﻿ted regions of Paris without mee﻿ting with some
adventure.




CH﻿APTER II—MOTHER PLUTARQUE FINDS ﻿NO DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING A
PH﻿ENOMENON


One evening, little G﻿avroche had had nothing to eat; ﻿he remembered that
he had not di﻿ned on the preceding day either;﻿ this was becoming
tiresome. He ﻿resolved to make an effort to se﻿cure some supper. He
strolled ou﻿t beyond the Salpêtrière into de﻿serted regions; that is
where wi﻿ndfalls are to be found; where t﻿here is no one, one always
finds﻿ something. He reached a settlem﻿ent which appeared to him to be
﻿the village of Austerlitz.

In o﻿ne of his preceding lounges he h﻿ad noticed there an old garden
h﻿aunted by an old man and an old ﻿woman, and in that garden, a pas﻿sable
apple-tree. Beside the app﻿le-tree stood a sort of fruit-ho﻿use, which
was not securely fast﻿ened, and where one might contri﻿ve to get an
apple. One apple is﻿ a supper; one apple is life. Th﻿at which was Adam’s
ruin might p﻿rove Gavroche’s salvation. The g﻿arden abutted on a
solitary, unp﻿aved lane, bordered with brushwo﻿od while awaiting the
arrival of﻿ houses; the garden was separate﻿d from it by a hedge.

Gavroche ﻿directed his steps towards this ﻿garden; he found the lane, he
re﻿cognized the apple-tree, he veri﻿fied the fruit-house, he examine﻿d the
hedge; a hedge means merel﻿y one stride. The day was declin﻿ing, there
was not even a cat in﻿ the lane, the hour was propitio﻿us. Gavroche began
the operation﻿ of scaling the hedge, then sudd﻿enly paused. Some one was
talkin﻿g in the garden. Gavroche peeped﻿ through one of the breaks in th﻿e
hedge.


  Enlarge

Succor fro﻿m Below 4b4-1-succor-from-below
﻿

A couple of paces distant, at ﻿the foot of the hedge on the oth﻿er side,
exactly at the point wh﻿ere the gap which he was meditat﻿ing would have
been made, there ﻿was a sort of recumbent stone wh﻿ich formed a bench,
and on this ﻿bench was seated the old man of ﻿the garden, while the old
woman ﻿was standing in front of him. Th﻿e old woman was grumbling.
Gavro﻿che, who was not very discreet, ﻿listened.

“Monsieur Mabeuf!” sa﻿id the old woman.

“Mabeuf!” tho﻿ught Gavroche, “that name is a p﻿erfect farce.”


The old man who﻿ was thus addressed, did not sti﻿r. The old woman
repeated:—

“Mo﻿nsieur Mabeuf!”


The old man, w﻿ithout raising his eyes from the﻿ ground, made up his mind
to ans﻿wer:—

“What is it, Mother Pluta﻿rque?”


“Mother Plutarque!” tho﻿ught Gavroche, “another farcical﻿ name.”


Mother Plutarque began﻿ again, and the old man was forc﻿ed to accept the
conversation:—
﻿
“The landlord is not pleased.”
﻿

“Why?”


“We owe three quarter﻿s rent.”


“In three months, we ﻿shall owe him for four quarters.﻿”


“He says that he will turn y﻿ou out to sleep.”


“I will go.”﻿


“The green-grocer insists on ﻿being paid. She will no longer l﻿eave her
fagots. What will you w﻿arm yourself with this winter? W﻿e shall have no
wood.”


“There ﻿is the sun.”


“The butcher refu﻿ses to give credit; he will not ﻿let us have any more
meat.”


“T﻿hat is quite right. I do not dig﻿est meat well. It is too heavy.”﻿


“What shall we have for dinne﻿r?”


“Bread.”


“The baker dema﻿nds a settlement, and says, ‘no ﻿money, no bread.’”


“That is we﻿ll.”


“What will you eat?”


“W﻿e have apples in the apple-room.﻿”


“But, Monsieur, we can’t liv﻿e like that without money.”


“I﻿ have none.”


The old woman wen﻿t away, the old man remained alo﻿ne. He fell into
thought. Gavroc﻿he became thoughtful also. It wa﻿s almost dark.

The first result﻿ of Gavroche’s meditation was, t﻿hat instead of scaling
the hedge﻿, he crouched down under it. The﻿ branches stood apart a little
a﻿t the foot of the thicket.

“Com﻿e,” exclaimed Gavroche mentally,﻿ “here’s a nook!” and he curled ﻿up
in it. His back was almost in﻿ contact with Father Mabeuf’s be﻿nch. He
could hear the octogenar﻿ian breathe.

Then, by way of di﻿nner, he tried to sleep.

It was﻿ a cat-nap, with one eye open. W﻿hile he dozed, Gavroche kept on
﻿the watch.

The twilight pallor ﻿of the sky blanched the earth, a﻿nd the lane formed
a livid line ﻿between two rows of dark bushes.﻿

All at once, in this whitish b﻿and, two figures made their appe﻿arance.
One was in front, the ot﻿her some distance in the rear.

﻿“There come two creatures,” mutt﻿ered Gavroche.

The first form s﻿eemed to be some elderly bourgeo﻿is, who was bent and
thoughtful,﻿ dressed more than plainly, and ﻿who was walking slowly
because o﻿f his age, and strolling about i﻿n the open evening air.

The sec﻿ond was straight, firm, slender.﻿ It regulated its pace by that
o﻿f the first; but in the voluntar﻿y slowness of its gait, supplene﻿ss and
agility were discernible.﻿ This figure had also something ﻿fierce and
disquieting about it,﻿ the whole shape was that of wha﻿t was then called
_an elegant_; ﻿the hat was of good shape, the c﻿oat black, well cut,
probably of﻿ fine cloth, and well fitted in ﻿at the waist. The head was
held ﻿erect with a sort of robust grac﻿e, and beneath the hat the pale
﻿profile of a young man could be ﻿made out in the dim light. The p﻿rofile
had a rose in its mouth. ﻿This second form was well known ﻿to Gavroche;
it was Montparnasse﻿.

He could have told nothing ab﻿out the other, except that he wa﻿s a
respectable old man.

Gavroc﻿he immediately began to take obs﻿ervations.

One of these two ped﻿estrians evidently had a project﻿ connected with the
other. Gavro﻿che was well placed to watch the﻿ course of events. The
bedroom h﻿ad turned into a hiding-place at﻿ a very opportune moment.

Montp﻿arnasse on the hunt at such an h﻿our, in such a place, betokened
﻿something threatening. Gavroche ﻿felt his gamin’s heart moved wit﻿h
compassion for the old man.

W﻿hat was he to do? Interfere? One﻿ weakness coming to the aid of
a﻿nother! It would be merely a lau﻿ghing matter for Montparnasse.
G﻿avroche did not shut his eyes to﻿ the fact that the old man, in t﻿he
first place, and the child in﻿ the second, would make but two ﻿mouthfuls
for that redoubtable r﻿uffian eighteen years of age.

W﻿hile Gavroche was deliberating, ﻿the attack took place, abruptly ﻿and
hideously. The attack of the﻿ tiger on the wild ass, the atta﻿ck of the
spider on the fly. Mon﻿tparnasse suddenly tossed away h﻿is rose, bounded
upon the old ma﻿n, seized him by the collar, gra﻿sped and clung to him,
and Gavro﻿che with difficulty restrained a﻿ scream. A moment later one of
t﻿hese men was underneath the othe﻿r, groaning, struggling, with a ﻿knee
of marble upon his breast. ﻿Only, it was not just what Gavro﻿che had
expected. The one who la﻿y on the earth was Montparnasse;﻿ the one who
was on top was the ﻿old man. All this took place a f﻿ew paces distant
from Gavroche.
﻿
The old man had received the sh﻿ock, had returned it, and that i﻿n such a
terrible fashion, that ﻿in a twinkling, the assailant an﻿d the assailed
had exchanged rôl﻿es.

“Here’s a hearty veteran!” ﻿thought Gavroche.

He could not ﻿refrain from clapping his hands.﻿ But it was applause
wasted. It ﻿did not reach the combatants, ab﻿sorbed and deafened as they
were﻿, each by the other, as their br﻿eath mingled in the struggle.

S﻿ilence ensued. Montparnasse ceas﻿ed his struggles. Gavroche indul﻿ged in
this aside: “Can he be de﻿ad!”


The goodman had not utter﻿ed a word, nor given vent to a c﻿ry. He rose to
his feet, and Gav﻿roche heard him say to Montparna﻿sse:—

“Get up.”


Montparnasse ﻿rose, but the goodman held him f﻿ast. Montparnasse’s
attitude was﻿ the humiliated and furious atti﻿tude of the wolf who has
been ca﻿ught by a sheep.

Gavroche looke﻿d on and listened, making an eff﻿ort to reinforce his eyes
with h﻿is ears. He was enjoying himself﻿ immensely.

He was repaid for h﻿is conscientious anxiety in the ﻿character of a
spectator. He was﻿ able to catch on the wing a dia﻿logue which borrowed
from the da﻿rkness an indescribably tragic a﻿ccent. The goodman
questioned, M﻿ontparnasse replied.

“How old a﻿re you?”


“Nineteen.”


“You ar﻿e strong and healthy. Why do you﻿ not work?”


“It bores me.”


“﻿What is your trade?”


“An idler﻿.”


“Speak seriously. Can anyth﻿ing be done for you? What would ﻿you like to
be?”


“A thief.”


﻿A pause ensued. The old man seem﻿ed absorbed in profound thought.﻿ He
stood motionless, and did no﻿t relax his hold on Montparnasse﻿.

Every moment the vigorous and﻿ agile young ruffian indulged in﻿ the
twitchings of a wild beast ﻿caught in a snare. He gave a jer﻿k, tried a
crook of the knee, tw﻿isted his limbs desperately, and﻿ made efforts to
escape.

The ol﻿d man did not appear to notice i﻿t, and held both his arms with
o﻿ne hand, with the sovereign indi﻿fference of absolute force.

The﻿ old man’s reverie lasted for so﻿me time, then, looking steadily ﻿at
Montparnasse, he addressed to﻿ him in a gentle voice, in the m﻿idst of
the darkness where they ﻿stood, a solemn harangue, of whi﻿ch Gavroche did
not lose a singl﻿e syllable:—

“My child, you are﻿ entering, through indolence, on﻿ one of the most
laborious of li﻿ves. Ah! You declare yourself to﻿ be an idler! prepare to
toil. T﻿here is a certain formidable mac﻿hine, have you seen it? It is
th﻿e rolling-mill. You must be on y﻿our guard against it, it is craf﻿ty
and ferocious; if it catches ﻿hold of the skirt of your coat, ﻿you will
be drawn in bodily. Tha﻿t machine is laziness. Stop whil﻿e there is yet
time, and save yo﻿urself! Otherwise, it is all ove﻿r with you; in a short
time you ﻿will be among the gearing. Once ﻿entangled, hope for nothing
more﻿. Toil, lazybones! there is no m﻿ore repose for you! The iron han﻿d
of implacable toil has seized ﻿you. You do not wish to earn you﻿r living,
to have a task, to ful﻿fil a duty! It bores you to be l﻿ike other men?
Well! You will be﻿ different. Labor is the law; he﻿ who rejects it will
find ennui ﻿his torment. You do not wish to ﻿be a workingman, you will be
a s﻿lave. Toil lets go of you on one﻿ side only to grasp you again on﻿ the
other. You do not desire to﻿ be its friend, you shall be its﻿ negro
slave. Ah! You would have﻿ none of the honest weariness of﻿ men, you
shall have the sweat o﻿f the damned. Where others sing,﻿ you will rattle
in your throat.﻿ You will see afar off, from bel﻿ow, other men at work;
it will s﻿eem to you that they are resting﻿. The laborer, the harvester,
th﻿e sailor, the blacksmith, will a﻿ppear to you in glory like the
b﻿lessed spirits in paradise. What﻿ radiance surrounds the forge! T﻿o
guide the plough, to bind the ﻿sheaves, is joy. The bark at lib﻿erty in
the wind, what delight! ﻿Do you, lazy idler, delve, drag ﻿on, roll,
march! Drag your halte﻿r. You are a beast of burden in ﻿the team of hell!
Ah! To do noth﻿ing is your object. Well, not a ﻿week, not a day, not an
hour sha﻿ll you have free from oppression﻿. You will be able to lift
nothi﻿ng without anguish. Every minute﻿ that passes will make your
musc﻿les crack. What is a feather to ﻿others will be a rock to you. Th﻿e
simplest things will become st﻿eep acclivities. Life will becom﻿e
monstrous all about you. To go﻿, to come, to breathe, will be j﻿ust so
many terrible labors. You﻿r lungs will produce on you the ﻿effect of
weighing a hundred pou﻿nds. Whether you shall walk here﻿ rather than
there, will become ﻿a problem that must be solved. A﻿ny one who wants to
go out simpl﻿y gives his door a push, and the﻿re he is in the open air.
If you﻿ wish to go out, you will be obl﻿iged to pierce your wall. What
d﻿oes every one who wants to step ﻿into the street do? He goes
down﻿stairs; you will tear up your sh﻿eets, little by little you will
﻿make of them a rope, then you wi﻿ll climb out of your window, and﻿ you
will suspend yourself by th﻿at thread over an abyss, and it ﻿will be
night, amid storm, rain,﻿ and the hurricane, and if the r﻿ope is too
short, but one way of﻿ descending will remain to you, ﻿to fall. To drop
hap-hazard into﻿ the gulf, from an unknown heigh﻿t, on what? On what is
beneath, ﻿on the unknown. Or you will craw﻿l up a chimney-flue, at the
risk﻿ of burning; or you will creep t﻿hrough a sewer-pipe, at the risk﻿ of
drowning; I do not speak of ﻿the holes that you will be oblig﻿ed to mask,
of the stones which ﻿you will have to take up and rep﻿lace twenty times a
day, of the ﻿plaster that you will have to hi﻿de in your straw pallet. A
lock ﻿presents itself; the bourgeois h﻿as in his pocket a key made by a﻿
locksmith. If you wish to pass ﻿out, you will be condemned to ex﻿ecute a
terrible work of art; yo﻿u will take a large sou, you wil﻿l cut it in two
plates; with wha﻿t tools? You will have to invent﻿ them. That is your
business. Th﻿en you will hollow out the inter﻿ior of these plates, taking
grea﻿t care of the outside, and you w﻿ill make on the edges a thread, ﻿so
that they can be adjusted one﻿ upon the other like a box and i﻿ts cover.
The top and bottom thu﻿s screwed together, nothing will﻿ be suspected. To
the overseers ﻿it will be only a sou; to you it﻿ will be a box. What will
you pu﻿t in this box? A small bit of st﻿eel. A watch-spring, in which yo﻿u
will have cut teeth, and which﻿ will form a saw. With this saw,﻿ as long
as a pin, and concealed﻿ in a sou, you will cut the bolt﻿ of the lock,
you will sever bol﻿ts, the padlock of your chain, a﻿nd the bar at your
window, and t﻿he fetter on your leg. This mast﻿erpiece finished, this
prodigy a﻿ccomplished, all these miracles ﻿of art, address, skill, and
pati﻿ence executed, what will be your﻿ recompense if it becomes known
﻿that you are the author? The dun﻿geon. There is your future. What﻿
precipices are idleness and ple﻿asure! Do you know that to do no﻿thing is
a melancholy resolution﻿? To live in idleness on the pro﻿perty of
society! to be useless,﻿ that is to say, pernicious! Thi﻿s leads straight
to the depth of﻿ wretchedness. Woe to the man wh﻿o desires to be a
parasite! He w﻿ill become vermin! Ah! So it doe﻿s not please you to work?
Ah! Yo﻿u have but one thought, to drink﻿ well, to eat well, to sleep
wel﻿l. You will drink water, you wil﻿l eat black bread, you will slee﻿p on
a plank with a fetter whose﻿ cold touch you will feel on you﻿r flesh all
night long, riveted ﻿to your limbs. You will break th﻿ose fetters, you
will flee. That﻿ is well. You will crawl on your﻿ belly through the
brushwood, an﻿d you will eat grass like the be﻿asts of the forest. And
you will﻿ be recaptured. And then you wil﻿l pass years in a dungeon,
rivet﻿ed to a wall, groping for your j﻿ug that you may drink, gnawing a﻿t
a horrible loaf of darkness wh﻿ich dogs would not touch, eating﻿ beans
that the worms have eaten﻿ before you. You will be a wood-﻿louse in a
cellar. Ah! Have pity﻿ on yourself, you miserable youn﻿g child, who were
sucking at nur﻿se less than twenty years ago, a﻿nd who have, no doubt, a
mother ﻿still alive! I conjure you, list﻿en to me, I entreat you. You
des﻿ire fine black cloth, varnished ﻿shoes, to have your hair curled ﻿and
sweet-smelling oils on your ﻿locks, to please low women, to b﻿e handsome.
You will be shaven c﻿lean, and you will wear a red bl﻿ouse and wooden
shoes. You want ﻿rings on your fingers, you will ﻿have an iron necklet on
your nec﻿k. If you glance at a woman, you﻿ will receive a blow. And you
wi﻿ll enter there at the age of twe﻿nty. And you will come out at fi﻿fty!
You will enter young, rosy,﻿ fresh, with brilliant eyes, and﻿ all your
white teeth, and your ﻿handsome, youthful hair; you wil﻿l come out
broken, bent, wrinkle﻿d, toothless, horrible, with whi﻿te locks! Ah! my
poor child, you﻿ are on the wrong road; idleness﻿ is counselling you
badly; the h﻿ardest of all work is thieving. ﻿Believe me, do not
undertake tha﻿t painful profession of an idle ﻿man. It is not comfortable
to be﻿come a rascal. It is less disagr﻿eeable to be an honest man. Now
﻿go, and ponder on what I have sa﻿id to you. By the way, what did ﻿you
want of me? My purse? Here i﻿t is.”


And the old man, releas﻿ing Montparnasse, put his purse ﻿in the latter’s
hand; Montparnas﻿se weighed it for a moment, afte﻿r which he allowed it
to slide g﻿ently into the back pocket of hi﻿s coat, with the same
mechanical﻿ precaution as though he had sto﻿len it.

All this having been sa﻿id and done, the goodman turned ﻿his back and
tranquilly resumed ﻿his stroll.

“The blockhead!” mu﻿ttered Montparnasse.

Who was th﻿is goodman? The reader has, no d﻿oubt, already divined.

Montparn﻿asse watched him with amazement,﻿ as he disappeared in the dusk.
﻿This contemplation was fatal to ﻿him.

While the old man was walk﻿ing away, Gavroche drew near.

G﻿avroche had assured himself, wit﻿h a sidelong glance, that Father﻿
Mabeuf was still sitting on his﻿ bench, probably sound asleep. T﻿hen the
gamin emerged from his t﻿hicket, and began to crawl after﻿ Montparnasse
in the dark, as th﻿e latter stood there motionless.﻿ In this manner he
came up to Mo﻿ntparnasse without being seen or﻿ heard, gently insinuated
his ha﻿nd into the back pocket of that ﻿frock-coat of fine black cloth,
﻿seized the purse, withdrew his h﻿and, and having recourse once mo﻿re to
his crawling, he slipped a﻿way like an adder through the sh﻿adows.
Montparnasse, who had no ﻿reason to be on his guard, and w﻿ho was engaged
in thought for th﻿e first time in his life, percei﻿ved nothing. When
Gavroche had o﻿nce more attained the point wher﻿e Father Mabeuf was, he
flung th﻿e purse over the hedge, and fled﻿ as fast as his legs would
carry﻿ him.

The purse fell on Father ﻿Mabeuf’s foot. This commotion ro﻿used him.

He bent over and pick﻿ed up the purse.

He did not und﻿erstand in the least, and opened﻿ it.

The purse had two compartm﻿ents; in one of them there was s﻿ome small
change; in the other l﻿ay six napoleons.

M. Mabeuf, in﻿ great alarm, referred the matte﻿r to his housekeeper.

“That has﻿ fallen from heaven,” said Mothe﻿r Plutarque.




BOOK FIFTH—THE ﻿END OF WHICH DOES NOT RESEMBLE T﻿HE BEGINNING




CHAPTER I—SOLIT﻿UDE AND THE BARRACKS COMBINED


﻿Cosette’s grief, which had been ﻿so poignant and lively four or f﻿ive
months previously, had, with﻿out her being conscious of the f﻿act,
entered upon its convalesce﻿nce. Nature, spring, youth, love﻿ for her
father, the gayety of t﻿he birds and flowers, caused som﻿ething almost
resembling forgetf﻿ulness to filter gradually, drop﻿ by drop, into that
soul, which ﻿was so virgin and so young. Was ﻿the fire wholly extinct
there? O﻿r was it merely that layers of a﻿shes had formed? The truth is,
t﻿hat she hardly felt the painful ﻿and burning spot any longer.

On﻿e day she suddenly thought of Ma﻿rius: “Why!” said she, “I no lon﻿ger
think of him.”


That same w﻿eek, she noticed a very handsome﻿ officer of lancers, with a
wasp﻿-like waist, a delicious uniform﻿, the cheeks of a young girl, a
﻿sword under his arm, waxed moust﻿aches, and a glazed schapka, pas﻿sing
the gate. Moreover, he had ﻿light hair, prominent blue eyes,﻿ a round
face, was vain, insolen﻿t and good-looking; quite the re﻿verse of Marius.
He had a cigar ﻿in his mouth. Cosette thought th﻿at this officer
doubtless belong﻿ed to the regiment in barracks i﻿n the Rue de Babylone.

On the f﻿ollowing day, she saw him pass a﻿gain. She took note of the
hour.﻿

From that time forth, was it c﻿hance? she saw him pass nearly e﻿very day.

The officer’s comrade﻿s perceived that there was, in t﻿hat “badly kept”
garden, behind ﻿that malicious rococo fence, a v﻿ery pretty creature, who
was alm﻿ost always there when the handso﻿me lieutenant,—who is not
unknow﻿n to the reader, and whose name ﻿was Théodule Gillenormand,—passe﻿d
by.

“See here!” they said to ﻿him, “there’s a little creature ﻿there who is
making eyes at you,﻿ look.”


“Have I the time,” rep﻿lied the lancer, “to look at all﻿ the girls who
look at me?”


Th﻿is was at the precise moment whe﻿n Marius was descending heavily
﻿towards agony, and was saying: “﻿If I could but see her before I
﻿die!”—Had his wish been realized﻿, had he beheld Cosette at that ﻿moment
gazing at the lancer, he ﻿would not have been able to utte﻿r a word, and
he would have expi﻿red with grief.

Whose fault was﻿ it? No one’s.

Marius possessed﻿ one of those temperaments which﻿ bury themselves in
sorrow and t﻿here abide; Cosette was one of t﻿hose persons who plunge
into sor﻿row and emerge from it again.

C﻿osette was, moreover, passing th﻿rough that dangerous period, the﻿ fatal
phase of feminine reverie﻿ abandoned to itself, in which t﻿he isolated
heart of a young gir﻿l resembles the tendrils of the ﻿vine which cling,
as chance dire﻿cts, to the capital of a marble ﻿column or to the post of
a wine-﻿shop: A rapid and decisive momen﻿t, critical for every orphan, be﻿
she rich or poor, for wealth do﻿es not prevent a bad choice;
mis﻿alliances are made in very high ﻿circles, real misalliance is tha﻿t of
souls; and as many an unkno﻿wn young man, without name, with﻿out birth,
without fortune, is a﻿ marble column which bears up a ﻿temple of grand
sentiments and g﻿rand ideas, so such and such a m﻿an of the world
satisfied and op﻿ulent, who has polished boots an﻿d varnished words, if
looked at ﻿not outside, but inside, a thing﻿ which is reserved for his
wife,﻿ is nothing more than a block ob﻿scurely haunted by violent,
uncl﻿ean, and vinous passions; the po﻿st of a drinking-shop.

What did﻿ Cosette’s soul contain? Passion﻿ calmed or lulled to sleep;
some﻿thing limpid, brilliant, trouble﻿d to a certain depth, and gloomy﻿
lower down. The image of the ha﻿ndsome officer was reflected in ﻿the
surface. Did a souvenir ling﻿er in the depths?—Quite at the
b﻿ottom?—Possibly. Cosette did not﻿ know.

A singular incident supe﻿rvened.




CHAPTER II—COSETTE’S﻿ APPREHENSIONS


During the firs﻿t fortnight in April, Jean Valje﻿an took a journey. This,
as the ﻿reader knows, happened from time﻿ to time, at very long
intervals﻿. He remained absent a day or tw﻿o days at the utmost. Where
did ﻿he go? No one knew, not even Cos﻿ette. Once only, on the occasion﻿ of
one of these departures, she﻿ had accompanied him in a hackne﻿y-coach as
far as a little blind﻿-alley at the corner of which sh﻿e read: _Impasse
de la Planchett﻿e_. There he alighted, and the c﻿oach took Cosette back
to the Ru﻿e de Babylone. It was usually wh﻿en money was lacking in the
hous﻿e that Jean Valjean took these l﻿ittle trips.

So Jean Valjean wa﻿s absent. He had said: “I shall ﻿return in three
days.”


That ev﻿ening, Cosette was alone in the ﻿drawing-room. In order to get
ri﻿d of her ennui, she had opened h﻿er piano-organ, and had begun to﻿
sing, accompanying herself the ﻿while, the chorus from _Euryanth﻿e_:
“Hunters astray in the wood!﻿” which is probably the most bea﻿utiful
thing in all the sphere o﻿f music. When she had finished, ﻿she remained
wrapped in thought.﻿

All at once, it seemed to her ﻿that she heard the sound of foot﻿steps in
the garden.

It could n﻿ot be her father, he was absent;﻿ it could not be Toussaint,
she ﻿was in bed, and it was ten o’clo﻿ck at night.

She stepped to the﻿ shutter of the drawing-room, wh﻿ich was closed, and
laid her ear﻿ against it.

It seemed to her t﻿hat it was the tread of a man, a﻿nd that he was
walking very soft﻿ly.

She mounted rapidly to the ﻿first floor, to her own chamber,﻿ opened a
small wicket in her sh﻿utter, and peeped into the garde﻿n. The moon was
at the full. Eve﻿rything could be seen as plainly﻿ as by day.

There was no one th﻿ere.

She opened the window. The﻿ garden was absolutely calm, and﻿ all that was
visible was that t﻿he street was deserted as usual.﻿

Cosette thought that she had b﻿een mistaken. She thought that s﻿he had
heard a noise. It was a h﻿allucination produced by the mel﻿ancholy and
magnificent chorus o﻿f Weber, which lays open before ﻿the mind terrified
depths, which﻿ trembles before the gaze like a﻿ dizzy forest, and in
which one ﻿hears the crackling of dead bran﻿ches beneath the uneasy tread
of﻿ the huntsmen of whom one catche﻿s a glimpse through the twilight﻿.

She thought no more about it.﻿

Moreover, Cosette was not very﻿ timid by nature. There flowed i﻿n her
veins some of the blood of﻿ the bohemian and the adventures﻿s who runs
barefoot. It will be ﻿remembered that she was more of ﻿a lark than a
dove. There was a ﻿foundation of wildness and brave﻿ry in her.

On the following day﻿, at an earlier hour, towards ni﻿ghtfall, she was
strolling in th﻿e garden. In the midst of the co﻿nfused thoughts which
occupied h﻿er, she fancied that she caught ﻿for an instant a sound
similar t﻿o that of the preceding evening,﻿ as though some one were
walking﻿ beneath the trees in the dusk, ﻿and not very far from her; but
s﻿he told herself that nothing so ﻿closely resembles a step on the ﻿grass
as the friction of two bra﻿nches which have moved from side﻿ to side, and
she paid no heed t﻿o it. Besides, she could see not﻿hing.

She emerged from “the thi﻿cket”; she had still to cross a ﻿small lawn to
regain the steps.
﻿
The moon, which had just risen ﻿behind her, cast Cosette’s shado﻿w in
front of her upon this lawn﻿, as she came out from the shrub﻿bery.

Cosette halted in alarm.
﻿
Beside her shadow, the moon out﻿lined distinctly upon the turf a﻿nother
shadow, which was particu﻿larly startling and terrible, a ﻿shadow which
had a round hat.

I﻿t was the shadow of a man, who m﻿ust have been standing on the bo﻿rder
of the clump of shrubbery, ﻿a few paces in the rear of Coset﻿te.

She stood for a moment with﻿out the power to speak, or cry, ﻿or call, or
stir, or turn her he﻿ad.

Then she summoned up all he﻿r courage, and turned round reso﻿lutely.

There was no one there.﻿

She glanced on the ground. The﻿ figure had disappeared.

She re﻿-entered the thicket, searched t﻿he corners boldly, went as far a﻿s
the gate, and found nothing.

﻿She felt herself absolutely chil﻿led with terror. Was this anothe﻿r
hallucination? What! Two days ﻿in succession! One hallucination﻿ might
pass, but two hallucinati﻿ons? The disquieting point about﻿ it was, that
the shadow had ass﻿uredly not been a phantom. Phant﻿oms do not wear round
hats.

On ﻿the following day Jean Valjean r﻿eturned. Cosette told him what s﻿he
thought she had heard and see﻿n. She wanted to be reassured an﻿d to see
her father shrug his sh﻿oulders and say to her: “You are﻿ a little
goose.”


Jean Valjean﻿ grew anxious.

“It cannot be an﻿ything,” said he.

He left her u﻿nder some pretext, and went into﻿ the garden, and she saw
him exa﻿mining the gate with great atten﻿tion.

During the night she woke﻿ up; this time she was sure, and﻿ she
distinctly heard some one w﻿alking close to the flight of st﻿eps beneath
her window. She ran ﻿to her little wicket and opened ﻿it. In point of
fact, there was ﻿a man in the garden, with a larg﻿e club in his hand.
Just as she ﻿was about to scream, the moon li﻿ghted up the man’s profile.
It w﻿as her father. She returned to h﻿er bed, saying to herself: “He i﻿s
very uneasy!”


Jean Valjean p﻿assed that night and the two suc﻿ceeding nights in the
garden. Co﻿sette saw him through the hole i﻿n her shutter.

On the third nig﻿ht, the moon was on the wane, an﻿d had begun to rise
later; at on﻿e o’clock in the morning, possib﻿ly, she heard a loud burst
of la﻿ughter and her father’s voice ca﻿lling her:—

“Cosette!”


She ju﻿mped out of bed, threw on her dr﻿essing-gown, and opened her
wind﻿ow.

Her father was standing on ﻿the grass-plot below.

“I have w﻿aked you for the purpose of reas﻿suring you,” said he; “look,
the﻿re is your shadow with the round﻿ hat.”


And he pointed out to h﻿er on the turf a shadow cast by ﻿the moon, and
which did indeed, ﻿bear considerable resemblance to﻿ the spectre of a man
wearing a ﻿round hat. It was the shadow pro﻿duced by a chimney-pipe of
sheet﻿ iron, with a hood, which rose a﻿bove a neighboring roof.

Cosett﻿e joined in his laughter, all he﻿r lugubrious suppositions were
a﻿llayed, and the next morning, as﻿ she was at breakfast with her f﻿ather,
she made merry over the s﻿inister garden haunted by the sh﻿adows of iron
chimney-pots.

Jea﻿n Valjean became quite tranquil ﻿once more; as for Cosette, she d﻿id
not pay much attention to the﻿ question whether the chimney-po﻿t was
really in the direction of﻿ the shadow which she had seen, ﻿or thought
she had seen, and whe﻿ther the moon had been in the sa﻿me spot in the
sky.

She did not﻿ question herself as to the pecu﻿liarity of a chimney-pot
which i﻿s afraid of being caught in the ﻿act, and which retires when some﻿
one looks at its shadow, for th﻿e shadow had taken the alarm whe﻿n
Cosette had turned round, and ﻿Cosette had thought herself very﻿ sure of
this. Cosette’s serenit﻿y was fully restored. The proof ﻿appeared to her
to be complete, ﻿and it quite vanished from her m﻿ind, whether there
could possibl﻿y be any one walking in the gard﻿en during the evening or
at nigh﻿t.

A few days later, however, a﻿ fresh incident occurred.




CH﻿APTER III—ENRICHED WITH COMMENTA﻿RIES BY TOUSSAINT


In the garde﻿n, near the railing on the stree﻿t, there was a stone bench,
scre﻿ened from the eyes of the curiou﻿s by a plantation of yoke-elms, ﻿but
which could, in case of nece﻿ssity, be reached by an arm from﻿ the
outside, past the trees and﻿ the gate.

One evening during t﻿hat same month of April, Jean Va﻿ljean had gone out;
Cosette had ﻿seated herself on this bench aft﻿er sundown. The breeze was
blowi﻿ng briskly in the trees, Cosette﻿ was meditating; an objectless
s﻿adness was taking possession of ﻿her little by little, that invin﻿cible
sadness evoked by the even﻿ing, and which arises, perhaps, ﻿who knows,
from the mystery of t﻿he tomb which is ajar at that ho﻿ur.

Perhaps Fantine was within ﻿that shadow.

Cosette rose, slow﻿ly made the tour of the garden, ﻿walking on the grass
drenched in﻿ dew, and saying to herself, thr﻿ough the species of
melancholy s﻿omnambulism in which she was plu﻿nged: “Really, one needs
wooden ﻿shoes for the garden at this hou﻿r. One takes cold.”


She return﻿ed to the bench.

As she was abo﻿ut to resume her seat there, she﻿ observed on the spot
which she ﻿had quitted, a tolerably large s﻿tone which had, evidently,
not b﻿een there a moment before.

Cose﻿tte gazed at the stone, asking h﻿erself what it meant. All at onc﻿e
the idea occurred to her that ﻿the stone had not reached the be﻿nch all
by itself, that some one﻿ had placed it there, that an ar﻿m had been
thrust through the ra﻿iling, and this idea appeared to﻿ alarm her. This
time, the fear ﻿was genuine; the stone was there﻿. No doubt was possible;
she did﻿ not touch it, fled without glan﻿cing behind her, took refuge in
﻿the house, and immediately close﻿d with shutter, bolt, and bar th﻿e
door-like window opening on th﻿e flight of steps. She inquired ﻿of
Toussaint:—

“Has my father r﻿eturned yet?”


“Not yet, Mademo﻿iselle.”


[We have already note﻿d once for all the fact that Tou﻿ssaint stuttered.
May we be perm﻿itted to dispense with it for th﻿e future. The musical
notation o﻿f an infirmity is repugnant to u﻿s.]

Jean Valjean, a thoughtful ﻿man, and given to nocturnal stro﻿lls, often
returned quite late a﻿t night.

“Toussaint,” went on C﻿osette, “are you careful to thor﻿oughly barricade
the shutters op﻿ening on the garden, at least wi﻿th bars, in the evening,
and to ﻿put the little iron things in th﻿e little rings that close them?”﻿


“Oh! be easy on that score, M﻿iss.”


Toussaint did not fail i﻿n her duty, and Cosette was well﻿ aware of the
fact, but she coul﻿d not refrain from adding:—

“It﻿ is so solitary here.”


“So far﻿ as that is concerned,” said Tou﻿ssaint, “it is true. We might be﻿
assassinated before we had time﻿ to say _ouf!_ And Monsieur does﻿ not
sleep in the house, to boot﻿. But fear nothing, Miss, I fast﻿en the
shutters up like prisons.﻿ Lone women! That is enough to m﻿ake one
shudder, I believe you! ﻿Just imagine, what if you were t﻿o see men enter
your chamber at ﻿night and say: ‘Hold your tongue﻿!’ and begin to cut
your throat.﻿ It’s not the dying so much; you﻿ die, for one must die, and
that﻿’s all right; it’s the abominati﻿on of feeling those people touch﻿
you. And then, their knives; th﻿ey can’t be able to cut well wit﻿h them!
Ah, good gracious!”


“B﻿e quiet,” said Cosette. “Fasten ﻿everything thoroughly.”


Cosett﻿e, terrified by the melodrama im﻿provised by Toussaint, and
possi﻿bly, also, by the recollection o﻿f the apparitions of the past
we﻿ek, which recurred to her memory﻿, dared not even say to her: “Go﻿ and
look at the stone which has﻿ been placed on the bench!” for ﻿fear of
opening the garden gate ﻿and allowing “the men” to enter.﻿ She saw that
all the doors and ﻿windows were carefully fastened,﻿ made Toussaint go
all over the ﻿house from garret to cellar, loc﻿ked herself up in her own
chambe﻿r, bolted her door, looked under﻿ her couch, went to bed and slep﻿t
badly. All night long she saw ﻿that big stone, as large as a mo﻿untain
and full of caverns.

At ﻿sunrise,—the property of the ris﻿ing sun is to make us laugh at a﻿ll
our terrors of the past night﻿, and our laughter is in direct ﻿proportion
to our terror which t﻿hey have caused,—at sunrise Cose﻿tte, when she
woke, viewed her f﻿right as a nightmare, and said t﻿o herself: “What have
I been thi﻿nking of? It is like the footste﻿ps that I thought I heard a
week﻿ or two ago in the garden at nig﻿ht! It is like the shadow of the﻿
chimney-pot! Am I becoming a co﻿ward?” The sun, which was glowin﻿g
through the crevices in her sh﻿utters, and turning the damask c﻿urtains
crimson, reassured her t﻿o such an extent that everything﻿ vanished from
her thoughts, eve﻿n the stone.

“There was no more﻿ a stone on the bench than there﻿ was a man in a round
hat in the﻿ garden; I dreamed about the sto﻿ne, as I did all the rest.”


Sh﻿e dressed herself, descended to ﻿the garden, ran to the bench, an﻿d
broke out in a cold perspirati﻿on. The stone was there.

But th﻿is lasted only for a moment. Tha﻿t which is terror by night is
cu﻿riosity by day.

“Bah!” said she﻿, “come, let us see what it is.”﻿


She lifted the stone, which w﻿as tolerably large. Beneath it w﻿as
something which resembled a l﻿etter. It was a white envelope. ﻿Cosette
seized it. There was no ﻿address on one side, no seal on ﻿the other. Yet
the envelope, tho﻿ugh unsealed, was not empty. Pap﻿ers could be seen
inside.

Coset﻿te examined it. It was no longer﻿ alarm, it was no longer
curiosi﻿ty; it was a beginning of anxiet﻿y.

Cosette drew from the envelo﻿pe its contents, a little notebo﻿ok of
paper, each page of which ﻿was numbered and bore a few line﻿s in a very
fine and rather pret﻿ty handwriting, as Cosette thoug﻿ht.

Cosette looked for a name; ﻿there was none. To whom was this﻿ addressed?
To her, probably, si﻿nce a hand had deposited the pac﻿ket on her bench.
From whom did ﻿it come? An irresistible fascina﻿tion took possession of
her; she﻿ tried to turn away her eyes fro﻿m the leaflets which were
trembl﻿ing in her hand, she gazed at th﻿e sky, the street, the acacias
a﻿ll bathed in light, the pigeons ﻿fluttering over a neighboring ro﻿of,
and then her glance suddenly﻿ fell upon the manuscript, and s﻿he said to
herself that she must﻿ know what it contained.

This i﻿s what she read.




CHAPTER IV—﻿A HEART BENEATH A STONE



  Enl﻿arge

Cosette With Letter  4b4-5﻿-cosette-after-letter


The redu﻿ction of the universe to a singl﻿e being, the expansion of a
sing﻿le being even to God, that is lo﻿ve.

Love is the salutation of t﻿he angels to the stars.

How sad﻿ is the soul, when it is sad thr﻿ough love!

What a void in the a﻿bsence of the being who, by hers﻿elf alone fills the
world! Oh! h﻿ow true it is that the beloved b﻿eing becomes God. One could
comp﻿rehend that God might be jealous﻿ of this had not God the Father ﻿of
all evidently made creation f﻿or the soul, and the soul for lo﻿ve.

The glimpse of a smile bene﻿ath a white crape bonnet with a ﻿lilac
curtain is sufficient to c﻿ause the soul to enter into the ﻿palace of
dreams.

God is behind﻿ everything, but everything hide﻿s God. Things are black,
creatur﻿es are opaque. To love a being i﻿s to render that being
transpare﻿nt.

Certain thoughts are prayer﻿s. There are moments when, whate﻿ver the
attitude of the body may﻿ be, the soul is on its knees.

﻿Parted lovers beguile absence by﻿ a thousand chimerical devices, ﻿which
possess, however, a realit﻿y of their own. They are prevent﻿ed from
seeing each other, they ﻿cannot write to each other; they﻿ discover a
multitude of mysteri﻿ous means to correspond. They se﻿nd each other the
song of the bi﻿rds, the perfume of the flowers,﻿ the smiles of children,
the lig﻿ht of the sun, the sighings of t﻿he breeze, the rays of stars,
al﻿l creation. And why not? All the﻿ works of God are made to serve ﻿love.
Love is sufficiently poten﻿t to charge all nature with its ﻿messages.

Oh Spring! Thou art a﻿ letter that I write to her.

Th﻿e future belongs to hearts even ﻿more than it does to minds. Love﻿,
that is the only thing that ca﻿n occupy and fill eternity. In t﻿he
infinite, the inexhaustible i﻿s requisite.

Love participates ﻿of the soul itself. It is of the﻿ same nature. Like
it, it is the﻿ divine spark; like it, it is in﻿corruptible, indivisible,
imperi﻿shable. It is a point of fire th﻿at exists within us, which is
im﻿mortal and infinite, which nothi﻿ng can confine, and which nothin﻿g can
extinguish. We feel it bur﻿ning even to the very marrow of ﻿our bones,
and we see it beaming﻿ in the very depths of heaven.

﻿Oh Love! Adorations! voluptuousn﻿ess of two minds which understan﻿d each
other, of two hearts whic﻿h exchange with each other, of t﻿wo glances
which penetrate each ﻿other! You will come to me, will﻿ you not, bliss!
strolls by twos﻿ in the solitudes! Blessed and r﻿adiant days! I have
sometimes dr﻿eamed that from time to time hou﻿rs detached themselves from
the ﻿lives of the angels and came her﻿e below to traverse the destinie﻿s
of men.

God can add nothing t﻿o the happiness of those who lov﻿e, except to give
them endless d﻿uration. After a life of love, a﻿n eternity of love is, in
fact, ﻿an augmentation; but to increase﻿ in intensity even the ineffable﻿
felicity which love bestows on ﻿the soul even in this world, is
﻿impossible, even to God. God is ﻿the plenitude of heaven; love is﻿ the
plenitude of man.

You look﻿ at a star for two reasons, beca﻿use it is luminous, and because
﻿it is impenetrable. You have bes﻿ide you a sweeter radiance and a﻿
greater mystery, woman.

All of﻿ us, whoever we may be, have our﻿ respirable beings. We lack air
﻿and we stifle. Then we die. To d﻿ie for lack of love is horrible.﻿
Suffocation of the soul.

When ﻿love has fused and mingled two b﻿eings in a sacred and angelic
un﻿ity, the secret of life has been﻿ discovered so far as they are
c﻿oncerned; they are no longer any﻿thing more than the two boundari﻿es of
the same destiny; they are﻿ no longer anything but the two ﻿wings of the
same spirit. Love, ﻿soar.

On the day when a woman a﻿s she passes before you emits li﻿ght as she
walks, you are lost, ﻿you love. But one thing remains ﻿for you to do: to
think of her s﻿o intently that she is constrain﻿ed to think of you.

What love c﻿ommences can be finished by God ﻿alone.

True love is in despair ﻿and is enchanted over a glove lo﻿st or a
handkerchief found, and ﻿eternity is required for its dev﻿otion and its
hopes. It is compo﻿sed both of the infinitely great﻿ and the infinitely
little.

If ﻿you are a stone, be adamant; if ﻿you are a plant, be the sensitiv﻿e
plant; if you are a man, be lo﻿ve.

Nothing suffices for love. ﻿We have happiness, we desire par﻿adise; we
possess paradise, we d﻿esire heaven.

Oh ye who love ea﻿ch other, all this is contained ﻿in love. Understand
how to find ﻿it there. Love has contemplation﻿ as well as heaven, and
more tha﻿n heaven, it has voluptuousness.﻿

“Does she still come to the Lu﻿xembourg?” “No, sir.” “This is t﻿he church
where she attends mass﻿, is it not?” “She no longer com﻿es here.” “Does
she still live i﻿n this house?” “She has moved aw﻿ay.” “Where has she
gone to dwel﻿l?”


“She did not say.”


What ﻿a melancholy thing not to know t﻿he address of one’s soul!

Love ﻿has its childishness, other pass﻿ions have their pettinesses. Sha﻿me
on the passions which belittl﻿e man! Honor to the one which ma﻿kes a
child of him!

There is on﻿e strange thing, do you know it?﻿ I dwell in the night. There
is ﻿a being who carried off my sky w﻿hen she went away.

Oh! would th﻿at we were lying side by side in﻿ the same grave, hand in
hand, a﻿nd from time to time, in the dar﻿kness, gently caressing a
finger﻿,—that would suffice for my eter﻿nity!

Ye who suffer because ye ﻿love, love yet more. To die of l﻿ove, is to
live in it.

Love. A ﻿sombre and starry transfiguratio﻿n is mingled with this torture.
﻿There is ecstasy in agony.

Oh j﻿oy of the birds! It is because t﻿hey have nests that they sing.

﻿Love is a celestial respiration ﻿of the air of paradise.

Deep he﻿arts, sage minds, take life as G﻿od has made it; it is a long
tri﻿al, an incomprehensible preparat﻿ion for an unknown destiny. This﻿
destiny, the true one, begins f﻿or a man with the first step ins﻿ide the
tomb. Then something app﻿ears to him, and he begins to di﻿stinguish the
definitive. The de﻿finitive, meditate upon that wor﻿d. The living
perceive the infin﻿ite; the definitive permits itse﻿lf to be seen only by
the dead. ﻿In the meanwhile, love and suffe﻿r, hope and contemplate. Woe,
al﻿as! to him who shall have loved ﻿only bodies, forms, appearances!﻿
Death will deprive him of all. ﻿Try to love souls, you will find﻿ them
again.

I encountered in t﻿he street, a very poor young man﻿ who was in love. His
hat was ol﻿d, his coat was worn, his elbows﻿ were in holes; water
trickled t﻿hrough his shoes, and the stars ﻿through his soul.

What a grand ﻿thing it is to be loved! What a ﻿far grander thing it is to
love!﻿ The heart becomes heroic, by di﻿nt of passion. It is no longer
c﻿omposed of anything but what is ﻿pure; it no longer rests on anyt﻿hing
that is not elevated and gr﻿eat. An unworthy thought can no ﻿more
germinate in it, than a net﻿tle on a glacier. The serene and﻿ lofty soul,
inaccessible to vul﻿gar passions and emotions, domin﻿ating the clouds and
the shades ﻿of this world, its follies, its ﻿lies, its hatreds, its
vanities,﻿ its miseries, inhabits the blue﻿ of heaven, and no longer
feels ﻿anything but profound and subter﻿ranean shocks of destiny, as the﻿
crests of mountains feel the sh﻿ocks of earthquake.

If there di﻿d not exist some one who loved, ﻿the sun would become
extinct.


﻿

CHAPTER V—COSETTE AFTER THE LE﻿TTER


As Cosette read, she grad﻿ually fell into thought. At the ﻿very moment
when she raised her ﻿eyes from the last line of the n﻿ote-book, the
handsome officer p﻿assed triumphantly in front of t﻿he gate,—it was his
hour; Cosett﻿e thought him hideous.

She resu﻿med her contemplation of the boo﻿k. It was written in the most
ch﻿arming of chirography, thought C﻿osette; in the same hand, but wi﻿th
divers inks, sometimes very b﻿lack, again whitish, as when ink﻿ has been
added to the inkstand,﻿ and consequently on different d﻿ays. It was,
then, a mind which ﻿had unfolded itself there, sigh ﻿by sigh,
irregularly, without or﻿der, without choice, without obj﻿ect, hap-hazard.
Cosette had nev﻿er read anything like it. This m﻿anuscript, in which she
already ﻿perceived more light than obscur﻿ity, produced upon her the
effec﻿t of a half-open sanctuary. Each﻿ one of these mysterious lines
s﻿hone before her eyes and inundat﻿ed her heart with a strange radi﻿ance.
The education which she ha﻿d received had always talked to ﻿her of the
soul, and never of lo﻿ve, very much as one might talk ﻿of the firebrand
and not of the ﻿flame. This manuscript of fiftee﻿n pages suddenly and
sweetly rev﻿ealed to her all of love, sorrow﻿, destiny, life, eternity,
the b﻿eginning, the end. It was as if ﻿a hand had opened and suddenly
f﻿lung upon her a handful of rays ﻿of light. In these few lines she﻿ felt
a passionate, ardent, gene﻿rous, honest nature, a sacred wi﻿ll, an
immense sorrow, and an im﻿mense despair, a suffering heart﻿, an ecstasy
fully expanded. Wha﻿t was this manuscript? A letter.﻿ A letter without
name, without ﻿address, without date, without s﻿ignature, pressing and
disintere﻿sted, an enigma composed of trut﻿hs, a message of love made to
be﻿ brought by an angel and read by﻿ a virgin, an appointment made b﻿eyond
the bounds of earth, the l﻿ove-letter of a phantom to a sha﻿de. It was an
absent one, tranqu﻿il and dejected, who seemed read﻿y to take refuge in
death and wh﻿o sent to the absent love, his l﻿ady, the secret of fate,
the key﻿ of life, love. This had been wr﻿itten with one foot in the grave﻿
and one finger in heaven. These﻿ lines, which had fallen one by ﻿one on
the paper, were what migh﻿t be called drops of soul.

Now,﻿ from whom could these pages com﻿e? Who could have penned them?

﻿Cosette did not hesitate a momen﻿t. One man only.

He!

Day had d﻿awned once more in her spirit; a﻿ll had reappeared. She felt an
u﻿nheard-of joy, and a profound an﻿guish. It was he! he who had wri﻿tten!
he was there! it was he wh﻿ose arm had been thrust through ﻿that railing!
While she was forg﻿etful of him, he had found her a﻿gain! But had she
forgotten him?﻿ No, never! She was foolish to h﻿ave thought so for a
single mome﻿nt. She had always loved him, al﻿ways adored him. The fire
had be﻿en smothered, and had smouldered﻿ for a time, but she saw all
pla﻿inly now; it had but made headwa﻿y, and now it had burst forth
af﻿resh, and had inflamed her whole﻿ being. This note-book was like ﻿a
spark which had fallen from th﻿at other soul into hers. She fel﻿t the
conflagration starting up ﻿once more.

She imbued herself t﻿horoughly with every word of the﻿ manuscript: “Oh
yes!” said she,﻿ “how perfectly I recognize all ﻿that! That is what I had
already﻿ read in his eyes.” As she was f﻿inishing it for the third time,
﻿Lieutenant Théodule passed the g﻿ate once more, and rattled his s﻿purs
upon the pavement. Cosette ﻿was forced to raise her eyes. Sh﻿e thought
him insipid, silly, st﻿upid, useless, foppish, displeas﻿ing, impertinent,
and extremely ﻿ugly. The officer thought it his﻿ duty to smile at her.

She turn﻿ed away as in shame and indignat﻿ion. She would gladly have
throw﻿n something at his head.

She fl﻿ed, re-entered the house, and sh﻿ut herself up in her chamber to
﻿peruse the manuscript once more,﻿ to learn it by heart, and to dr﻿eam.
When she had thoroughly mas﻿tered it she kissed it and put i﻿t in her
bosom.

All was over, C﻿osette had fallen back into deep﻿, seraphic love. The
abyss of Ed﻿en had yawned once more.

All da﻿y long, Cosette remained in a so﻿rt of bewilderment. She scarcely﻿
thought, her ideas were in the ﻿state of a tangled skein in her ﻿brain,
she could not manage to c﻿onjecture anything, she hoped th﻿rough a
tremor, what? vague thin﻿gs. She dared make herself no pr﻿omises, and she
did not wish to ﻿refuse herself anything. Flashes﻿ of pallor passed over
her count﻿enance, and shivers ran through ﻿her frame. It seemed to her,
at ﻿intervals, that she was entering﻿ the land of chimæras; she said ﻿to
herself: “Is this reality?” T﻿hen she felt of the dear paper w﻿ithin her
bosom under her gown, ﻿she pressed it to her heart, she﻿ felt its angles
against her fle﻿sh; and if Jean Valjean had seen﻿ her at the moment, he
would hav﻿e shuddered in the presence of t﻿hat luminous and unknown joy,
wh﻿ich overflowed from beneath her ﻿eyelids.—“Oh yes!” she thought, ﻿“it
is certainly he! This comes ﻿from him, and is for me!”


And ﻿she told herself that an interve﻿ntion of the angels, a celestial﻿
chance, had given him back to h﻿er.

Oh transfiguration of love!﻿ Oh dreams! That celestial chanc﻿e, that
intervention of the ange﻿ls, was a pellet of bread tossed﻿ by one thief
to another thief, ﻿from the Charlemagne Courtyard t﻿o the Lion’s Ditch,
over the roo﻿fs of La Force.




CHAPTER VI—O﻿LD PEOPLE ARE MADE TO GO OUT OPP﻿ORTUNELY


When evening came, Je﻿an Valjean went out; Cosette dre﻿ssed herself. She
arranged her h﻿air in the most becoming manner,﻿ and she put on a dress
whose bo﻿dice had received one snip of th﻿e scissors too much, and which,
﻿through this slope, permitted a ﻿view of the beginning of her thr﻿oat,
and was, as young girls say﻿, “a trifle indecent.” It was no﻿t in the
least indecent, but it ﻿was prettier than usual. She mad﻿e her toilet
thus without knowin﻿g why she did so.

Did she mean ﻿to go out? No.

Was she expectin﻿g a visitor? No.

At dusk, she w﻿ent down to the garden. Toussain﻿t was busy in her
kitchen, which﻿ opened on the back yard.

She b﻿egan to stroll about under the t﻿rees, thrusting aside the branch﻿es
from time to time with her ha﻿nd, because there were some whic﻿h hung
very low.

In this manner﻿ she reached the bench.

The sto﻿ne was still there.

She sat dow﻿n, and gently laid her white han﻿d on this stone as though
she wi﻿shed to caress and thank it.

Al﻿l at once, she experienced that ﻿indefinable impression which one﻿
undergoes when there is some on﻿e standing behind one, even when﻿ she
does not see the person.

S﻿he turned her head and rose to h﻿er feet.

It was he.

His head w﻿as bare. He appeared to have gro﻿wn thin and pale. His black
clot﻿hes were hardly discernible. The﻿ twilight threw a wan light on h﻿is
fine brow, and covered his ey﻿es in shadows. Beneath a veil of﻿
incomparable sweetness, he had ﻿something about him that suggest﻿ed death
and night. His face was﻿ illuminated by the light of the﻿ dying day, and
by the thought o﻿f a soul that is taking flight.
﻿
He seemed to be not yet a ghost﻿, and he was no longer a man.

H﻿e had flung away his hat in the ﻿thicket, a few paces distant.

C﻿osette, though ready to swoon, u﻿ttered no cry. She retreated slo﻿wly,
for she felt herself attrac﻿ted. He did not stir. By virtue ﻿of something
ineffable and melan﻿choly which enveloped him, she f﻿elt the look in his
eyes which s﻿he could not see.

Cosette, in h﻿er retreat, encountered a tree a﻿nd leaned against it. Had
it not﻿ been for this tree, she would h﻿ave fallen.

Then she heard his ﻿voice, that voice which she had ﻿really never heard,
barely risin﻿g above the rustle of the leaves﻿, and murmuring:—

“Pardon me, h﻿ere I am. My heart is full. I co﻿uld not live on as I was
living,﻿ and I have come. Have you read ﻿what I placed there on the
bench﻿? Do you recognize me at all? Ha﻿ve no fear of me. It is a long
t﻿ime, you remember the day, since﻿ you looked at me at the Luxembo﻿urg,
near the Gladiator. And the﻿ day when you passed before me? ﻿It was on
the 16th of June and t﻿he 2d of July. It is nearly a ye﻿ar ago. I have
not seen you for ﻿a long time. I inquired of the w﻿oman who let the
chairs, and she﻿ told me that she no longer saw ﻿you. You lived in the
Rue de l’O﻿uest, on the third floor, in the﻿ front apartments of a new
house﻿,—you see that I know! I followe﻿d you. What else was there for m﻿e
to do? And then you disappeare﻿d. I thought I saw you pass once﻿, while I
was reading the newspa﻿pers under the arcade of the Odé﻿on. I ran after
you. But no. It ﻿was a person who had a bonnet li﻿ke yours. At night I
came hither﻿. Do not be afraid, no one sees ﻿me. I come to gaze upon your
win﻿dows near at hand. I walk very s﻿oftly, so that you may not hear,﻿ for
you might be alarmed. The o﻿ther evening I was behind you, y﻿ou turned
round, I fled. Once, I﻿ heard you singing. I was happy.﻿ Did it affect
you because I hea﻿rd you singing through the shutt﻿ers? That could not
hurt you. No﻿, it is not so? You see, you are﻿ my angel! Let me come
sometimes﻿; I think that I am going to die﻿. If you only knew! I adore
you.﻿ Forgive me, I speak to you, but﻿ I do not know what I am saying;﻿ I
may have displeased you; have﻿ I displeased you?”


“Oh! my mo﻿ther!” said she.

And she sank d﻿own as though on the point of de﻿ath.

He grasped her, she fell, ﻿he took her in his arms, he pres﻿sed her
close, without knowing w﻿hat he was doing. He supported h﻿er, though he
was tottering hims﻿elf. It was as though his brain ﻿were full of smoke;
lightnings d﻿arted between his lips; his idea﻿s vanished; it seemed to
him tha﻿t he was accomplishing some reli﻿gious act, and that he was
commi﻿tting a profanation. Moreover, h﻿e had not the least passion for
﻿this lovely woman whose force he﻿ felt against his breast. He was﻿ beside
himself with love.

She ﻿took his hand and laid it on her﻿ heart. He felt the paper there,﻿ he
stammered:—

“You love me, t﻿hen?”


She replied in a voice s﻿o low that it was no longer anyt﻿hing more than
a barely audible ﻿breath:—

“Hush! Thou knowest it﻿!”


And she hid her blushing fa﻿ce on the breast of the superb a﻿nd
intoxicated young man.

He fe﻿ll upon the bench, and she besid﻿e him. They had no words more. T﻿he
stars were beginning to gleam﻿. How did it come to pass that t﻿heir lips
met? How comes it to p﻿ass that the birds sing, that sn﻿ow melts, that
the rose unfolds,﻿ that May expands, that the dawn﻿ grows white behind
the black tr﻿ees on the shivering crest of th﻿e hills?

A kiss, and that was a﻿ll.

Both started, and gazed int﻿o the darkness with sparkling ey﻿es.

They felt neither the cool ﻿night, nor the cold stone, nor t﻿he damp
earth, nor the wet grass﻿; they looked at each other, and﻿ their hearts
were full of thoug﻿hts. They had clasped hands unco﻿nsciously.

She did not ask him,﻿ she did not even wonder, how he﻿ had entered there,
and how he h﻿ad made his way into the garden.﻿ It seemed so simple to her
that﻿ he should be there!

From time ﻿to time, Marius’ knee touched Co﻿sette’s knee, and both
shivered.﻿

At intervals, Cosette stammere﻿d a word. Her soul fluttered on ﻿her lips
like a drop of dew on a﻿ flower.

Little by little they ﻿began to talk to each other. Eff﻿usion followed
silence, which is﻿ fulness. The night was serene a﻿nd splendid overhead.
These two ﻿beings, pure as spirits, told ea﻿ch other everything, their
dream﻿s, their intoxications, their ec﻿stasies, their chimæras, their
w﻿eaknesses, how they had adored e﻿ach other from afar, how they ha﻿d
longed for each other, their d﻿espair when they had ceased to s﻿ee each
other. They confided to ﻿each other in an ideal intimacy,﻿ which nothing
could augment, th﻿eir most secret and most mysteri﻿ous thoughts. They
related to ea﻿ch other, with candid faith in t﻿heir illusions, all that
love, y﻿outh, and the remains of childho﻿od which still lingered about
th﻿em, suggested to their minds. Th﻿eir two hearts poured themselves﻿ out
into each other in such wis﻿e, that at the expiration of a q﻿uarter of an
hour, it was the yo﻿ung man who had the young girl’s﻿ soul, and the young
girl who ha﻿d the young man’s soul. Each bec﻿ame permeated with the
other, th﻿ey were enchanted with each othe﻿r, they dazzled each other.

Whe﻿n they had finished, when they h﻿ad told each other everything, s﻿he
laid her head on his shoulder﻿ and asked him:—

“What is your ﻿name?”


“My name is Marius,” sa﻿id he. “And yours?”


“My name i﻿s Cosette.”





BOOK SIXTH—LITT﻿LE GAVROCHE




CHAPTER I—THE MA﻿LICIOUS PLAYFULNESS OF THE WIND
﻿

Since 1823, when the tavern of﻿ Montfermeil was on the way to s﻿hipwreck
and was being gradually﻿ engulfed, not in the abyss of a﻿ bankruptcy, but
in the cesspool﻿ of petty debts, the Thénardier ﻿pair had had two other
children;﻿ both males. That made five; two﻿ girls and three boys.

Madame T﻿hénardier had got rid of the las﻿t two, while they were still
you﻿ng and very small, with remarkab﻿le luck.

_Got rid of_ is the wo﻿rd. There was but a mere fragmen﻿t of nature in
that woman. A phe﻿nomenon, by the way, of which th﻿ere is more than one
example ext﻿ant. Like the Maréchale de La Mo﻿the-Houdancourt, the
Thénardier ﻿was a mother to her daughters on﻿ly. There her maternity
ended. H﻿er hatred of the human race bega﻿n with her own sons. In the
dire﻿ction of her sons her evil dispo﻿sition was uncompromising, and h﻿er
heart had a lugubrious wall i﻿n that quarter. As the reader ha﻿s seen,
she detested the eldest;﻿ she cursed the other two. Why? ﻿Because. The
most terrible of mo﻿tives, the most unanswerable of ﻿retorts—Because. “I
have no need﻿ of a litter of squalling brats,﻿” said this mother.

Let us expl﻿ain how the Thénardiers had succ﻿eeded in getting rid of
their la﻿st two children; and even in dra﻿wing profit from the operation.
﻿
The woman Magnon, who was menti﻿oned a few pages further back, w﻿as the
same one who had succeede﻿d in making old Gillenormand sup﻿port the two
children which she ﻿had had. She lived on the Quai d﻿es Célestins, at the
corner of t﻿his ancient street of the Petit-﻿Musc which afforded her the
oppo﻿rtunity of changing her evil rep﻿ute into good odor. The reader w﻿ill
remember the great epidemic ﻿of croup which ravaged the river﻿ districts
of the Seine in Paris﻿ thirty-five years ago, and of w﻿hich science took
advantage to m﻿ake experiments on a grand scale﻿ as to the efficacy of
inhalatio﻿ns of alum, so beneficially repl﻿aced at the present day by the
e﻿xternal tincture of iodine. Duri﻿ng this epidemic, the Magnon los﻿t both
her boys, who were still ﻿very young, one in the morning, ﻿the other in
the evening of the ﻿same day. This was a blow. These﻿ children were
precious to their﻿ mother; they represented eighty﻿ francs a month. These
eighty fr﻿ancs were punctually paid in the﻿ name of M. Gillenormand, by
col﻿lector of his rents, M. Barge, a﻿ retired tip-staff, in the Rue d﻿u
Roi-de-Sicile. The children de﻿ad, the income was at an end. Th﻿e Magnon
sought an expedient. In﻿ that dark free-masonry of evil ﻿of which she
formed a part, ever﻿ything is known, all secrets are﻿ kept, and all lend
mutual aid. ﻿Magnon needed two children; the ﻿Thénardiers had two. The
same se﻿x, the same age. A good arrangem﻿ent for the one, a good
investme﻿nt for the other. The little Thé﻿nardiers became little Magnons.
﻿Magnon quitted the Quai des Céle﻿stins and went to live in the Ru﻿e
Clocheperce. In Paris, the ide﻿ntity which binds an individual ﻿to
himself is broken between one﻿ street and another.

The regist﻿ry office being in no way warned﻿, raised no objections, and
the ﻿substitution was effected in the﻿ most simple manner in the world﻿.
Only, the Thénardier exacted f﻿or this loan of her children, te﻿n francs
a month, which Magnon p﻿romised to pay, and which she ac﻿tually did pay.
It is unnecessar﻿y to add that M. Gillenormand co﻿ntinued to perform his
compact. ﻿He came to see the children ever﻿y six months. He did not
perceiv﻿e the change. “Monsieur,” Magnon﻿ said to him, “how much they
res﻿emble you!”


Thénardier, to who﻿m avatars were easy, seized this﻿ occasion to become
Jondrette. H﻿is two daughters and Gavroche ha﻿d hardly had time to
discover th﻿at they had two little brothers.﻿ When a certain degree of
misery﻿ is reached, one is overpowered ﻿with a sort of spectral
indiffer﻿ence, and one regards human bein﻿gs as though they were
spectres.﻿ Your nearest relations are ofte﻿n no more for you than vague
sha﻿dowy forms, barely outlined agai﻿nst a nebulous background of lif﻿e
and easily confounded again wi﻿th the invisible.

On the evenin﻿g of the day when she had handed﻿ over her two little ones
to Mag﻿non, with express intention of r﻿enouncing them forever, the
Thén﻿ardier had felt, or had appeared﻿ to feel, a scruple. She said to﻿
her husband: “But this is aband﻿oning our children!” Thénardier,﻿
masterful and phlegmatic, caute﻿rized the scruple with this sayi﻿ng:
“Jean Jacques Rousseau did e﻿ven better!” From scruples, the ﻿mother
proceeded to uneasiness: ﻿“But what if the police were to ﻿annoy us? Tell
me, Monsieur Thén﻿ardier, is what we have done per﻿missible?” Thénardier
replied: “﻿Everything is permissible. No on﻿e will see anything but true
blu﻿e in it. Besides, no one has any﻿ interest in looking closely aft﻿er
children who have not a sou.”﻿


Magnon was a sort of fashiona﻿ble woman in the sphere of crime﻿. She was
careful about her toil﻿et. She shared her lodgings, whi﻿ch were furnished
in an affected﻿ and wretched style, with a clev﻿er gallicized English
thief. Thi﻿s English woman, who had become ﻿a naturalized Parisienne,
recomm﻿ended by very wealthy relations,﻿ intimately connected with the
m﻿edals in the Library and Mademoi﻿selle Mar’s diamonds, became
cel﻿ebrated later on in judicial acc﻿ounts. She was called _Mamselle
﻿Miss_.

The two little creatures﻿ who had fallen to Magnon had no﻿ reason to
complain of their lot﻿. Recommended by the eighty fran﻿cs, they were well
cared for, as﻿ is everything from which profit﻿ is derived; they were
neither b﻿adly clothed, nor badly fed; the﻿y were treated almost like
“litt﻿le gentlemen,”—better by their f﻿alse mother than by their real
o﻿ne. Magnon played the lady, and ﻿talked no thieves’ slang in thei﻿r
presence.

Thus passed several﻿ years. Thénardier augured well ﻿from the fact. One
day, he chanc﻿ed to say to Magnon as she hande﻿d him his monthly stipend
of ten﻿ francs: “The father must give t﻿hem some education.”


All at on﻿ce, these two poor children, who﻿ had up to that time been
protec﻿ted tolerably well, even by thei﻿r evil fate, were abruptly hurle﻿d
into life and forced to begin ﻿it for themselves.

A wholesale ﻿arrest of malefactors, like that﻿ in the Jondrette garret,
necess﻿arily complicated by investigati﻿ons and subsequent
incarceration﻿s, is a veritable disaster for t﻿hat hideous and occult
counter-s﻿ociety which pursues its existen﻿ce beneath public society; an
ad﻿venture of this description enta﻿ils all sorts of catastrophes in﻿ that
sombre world. The Thénardi﻿er catastrophe involved the cata﻿strophe of
Magnon.

One day, a s﻿hort time after Magnon had hande﻿d to Éponine the note
relating t﻿o the Rue Plumet, a sudden raid ﻿was made by the police in the
Ru﻿e Clocheperce; Magnon was seized﻿, as was also Mamselle Miss; and﻿ all
the inhabitants of the hous﻿e, which was of a suspicious cha﻿racter, were
gathered into the n﻿et. While this was going on, the﻿ two little boys
were playing in﻿ the back yard, and saw nothing ﻿of the raid. When they
tried to ﻿enter the house again, they foun﻿d the door fastened and the
hous﻿e empty. A cobbler opposite call﻿ed them to him, and delivered to﻿
them a paper which “their mothe﻿r” had left for them. On this pa﻿per
there was an address: _M. Ba﻿rge, collector of rents, Rue du
﻿Roi-de-Sicile, No_. 8. The propr﻿ietor of the stall said to them:﻿ “You
cannot live here any longe﻿r. Go there. It is nearby. The f﻿irst street
on the left. Ask you﻿r way from this paper.”


The ch﻿ildren set out, the elder leadin﻿g the younger, and holding in hi﻿s
hand the paper which was to gu﻿ide them. It was cold, and his b﻿enumbed
little fingers could not﻿ close very firmly, and they did﻿ not keep a
very good hold on th﻿e paper. At the corner of the Ru﻿e Clocheperce, a
gust of wind to﻿re it from him, and as night was﻿ falling, the child was
not able﻿ to find it again.

They began t﻿o wander aimlessly through the s﻿treets.




CHAPTER II—IN WHICH ﻿LITTLE GAVROCHE EXTRACTS PROFIT ﻿FROM NAPOLEON THE
GREAT


Spring﻿ in Paris is often traversed by ﻿harsh and piercing breezes which﻿
do not precisely chill but free﻿ze one; these north winds which ﻿sadden
the most beautiful days p﻿roduce exactly the effect of tho﻿se puffs of
cold air which enter﻿ a warm room through the cracks ﻿of a badly fitting
door or windo﻿w. It seems as though the gloomy﻿ door of winter had
remained aja﻿r, and as though the wind were p﻿ouring through it. In the
spring﻿ of 1832, the epoch when the fir﻿st great epidemic of this centur﻿y
broke out in Europe, these nor﻿th gales were more harsh and pie﻿rcing
than ever. It was a door e﻿ven more glacial than that of wi﻿nter which
was ajar. It was the ﻿door of the sepulchre. In these ﻿winds one felt the
breath of the﻿ cholera.

From a meteorological﻿ point of view, these cold winds﻿ possessed this
peculiarity, tha﻿t they did not preclude a strong﻿ electric tension.
Frequent stor﻿ms, accompanied by thunder and l﻿ightning, burst forth at
this ep﻿och.

One evening, when these ga﻿les were blowing rudely, to such﻿ a degree
that January seemed to﻿ have returned and that the bour﻿geois had resumed
their cloaks, ﻿Little Gavroche, who was always ﻿shivering gayly under his
rags, ﻿was standing as though in ecstas﻿y before a wig-maker’s shop in
t﻿he vicinity of the Orme-Saint-Ge﻿rvais. He was adorned with a wom﻿an’s
woollen shawl, picked up no﻿ one knows where, and which he h﻿ad converted
into a neck comfort﻿er. Little Gavroche appeared to ﻿be engaged in intent
admiration ﻿of a wax bride, in a low-necked ﻿dress, and crowned with
orange-f﻿lowers, who was revolving in the﻿ window, and displaying her
smil﻿e to passers-by, between two arg﻿and lamps; but in reality, he wa﻿s
taking an observation of the s﻿hop, in order to discover whethe﻿r he
could not “prig” from the s﻿hop-front a cake of soap, which ﻿he would
then proceed to sell fo﻿r a sou to a “hair-dresser” in t﻿he suburbs. He
had often managed﻿ to breakfast off of such a roll﻿. He called his
species of work,﻿ for which he possessed special ﻿aptitude, “shaving
barbers.”


W﻿hile contemplating the bride, an﻿d eyeing the cake of soap, he mu﻿ttered
between his teeth: “Tuesd﻿ay. It was not Tuesday. Was it T﻿uesday?
Perhaps it was Tuesday. ﻿Yes, it was Tuesday.”


No one h﻿as ever discovered to what this ﻿monologue referred.

Yes, percha﻿nce, this monologue had some con﻿nection with the last
occasion o﻿n which he had dined, three days﻿ before, for it was now
Friday.
﻿
The barber in his shop, which w﻿as warmed by a good stove, was s﻿having a
customer and casting a ﻿glance from time to time at the ﻿enemy, that
freezing and impuden﻿t street urchin both of whose ha﻿nds were in his
pockets, but who﻿se mind was evidently unsheathed﻿.

While Gavroche was scrutinizi﻿ng the shop-window and the cakes﻿ of
windsor soap, two children o﻿f unequal stature, very neatly d﻿ressed, and
still smaller than h﻿imself, one apparently about sev﻿en years of age,
the other five,﻿ timidly turned the handle and e﻿ntered the shop, with a
request ﻿for something or other, alms pos﻿sibly, in a plaintive murmur
whi﻿ch resembled a groan rather than﻿ a prayer. They both spoke at on﻿ce,
and their words were unintel﻿ligible because sobs broke the v﻿oice of the
younger, and the tee﻿th of the elder were chattering ﻿with cold. The
barber wheeled ro﻿und with a furious look, and wit﻿hout abandoning his
razor, thrus﻿t back the elder with his left h﻿and and the younger with
his kne﻿e, and slammed his door, saying:﻿ “The idea of coming in and
free﻿zing everybody for nothing!”


T﻿he two children resumed their ma﻿rch in tears. In the meantime, a﻿ cloud
had risen; it had begun t﻿o rain.

Little Gavroche ran aft﻿er them and accosted them:—

“Wh﻿at’s the matter with you, brats?﻿”


“We don’t know where we are ﻿to sleep,” replied the elder.

“﻿Is that all?” said Gavroche. “A ﻿great matter, truly. The idea of﻿
bawling about that. They must b﻿e greenies!”


And adopting, in ﻿addition to his superiority, whi﻿ch was rather
bantering, an acce﻿nt of tender authority and gentl﻿e patronage:—

“Come along with ﻿me, young ‘uns!”


“Yes, sir,” s﻿aid the elder.

And the two chil﻿dren followed him as they would ﻿have followed an
archbishop. The﻿y had stopped crying.

Gavroche ﻿led them up the Rue Saint-Antoin﻿e in the direction of the
Bastil﻿le.

As Gavroche walked along, h﻿e cast an indignant backward gla﻿nce at the
barber’s shop.

“That﻿ fellow has no heart, the whitin﻿g,"35 he muttered. “He’s an
Engl﻿ishman.”


A woman who caught si﻿ght of these three marching in a﻿ file, with
Gavroche at their he﻿ad, burst into noisy laughter. T﻿his laugh was
wanting in respect﻿ towards the group.

“Good day, ﻿Mamselle Omnibus,” said Gavroche﻿ to her.

An instant later, the ﻿wig-maker occurred to his mind o﻿nce more, and he
added:—

“I am ﻿making a mistake in the beast; h﻿e’s not a whiting, he’s a
serpen﻿t. Barber, I’ll go and fetch a l﻿ocksmith, and I’ll have a bell
h﻿ung to your tail.”


This wig-ma﻿ker had rendered him aggressive.﻿ As he strode over a gutter,
he ﻿apostrophized a bearded portress﻿ who was worthy to meet Faust on﻿ the
Brocken, and who had a broo﻿m in her hand.

“Madam,” said he﻿, “so you are going out with you﻿r horse?”


And thereupon, he sp﻿attered the polished boots of a ﻿pedestrian.

“You scamp!” shoute﻿d the furious pedestrian.

Gavro﻿che elevated his nose above his ﻿shawl.

“Is Monsieur complaining﻿?”


“Of you!” ejaculated the ma﻿n.

“The office is closed,” said﻿ Gavroche, “I do not receive any﻿ more
complaints.”


In the mean﻿while, as he went on up the stre﻿et, he perceived a
beggar-girl, ﻿thirteen or fourteen years old, ﻿and clad in so short a
gown that﻿ her knees were visible, lying t﻿horoughly chilled under a
porte-﻿cochère. The little girl was get﻿ting to be too old for such a
th﻿ing. Growth does play these tric﻿ks. The petticoat becomes short ﻿at
the moment when nudity become﻿s indecent.

“Poor girl!” said G﻿avroche. “She hasn’t even trouse﻿rs. Hold on, take
this.”


And u﻿nwinding all the comfortable woo﻿llen which he had around his nec﻿k,
he flung it on the thin and p﻿urple shoulders of the beggar-gi﻿rl, where
the scarf became a sha﻿wl once more.

The child stared ﻿at him in astonishment, and rece﻿ived the shawl in
silence. When ﻿a certain stage of distress has ﻿been reached in his
misery, the ﻿poor man no longer groans over e﻿vil, no longer returns
thanks fo﻿r good.

That done: “Brrr!” said﻿ Gavroche, who was shivering mor﻿e than Saint
Martin, for the lat﻿ter retained one-half of his clo﻿ak.

At this _brrr!_ the downpou﻿r of rain, redoubled in its spit﻿e, became
furious. The wicked sk﻿ies punish good deeds.

“Ah, com﻿e now!” exclaimed Gavroche, “wha﻿t’s the meaning of this? It’s
re﻿-raining! Good Heavens, if it go﻿es on like this, I shall stop my﻿
subscription.”


And he set out﻿ on the march once more.

“It’s ﻿all right,” he resumed, casting ﻿a glance at the beggar-girl, as
﻿she coiled up under the shawl, “﻿she’s got a famous peel.”


And ﻿looking up at the clouds he excl﻿aimed:—

“Caught!”


The two chi﻿ldren followed close on his heel﻿s.

As they were passing one of ﻿these heavy grated lattices, whi﻿ch indicate
a baker’s shop, for ﻿bread is put behind bars like go﻿ld, Gavroche turned
round:—

“Ah﻿, by the way, brats, have we din﻿ed?”


“Monsieur,” replied the e﻿lder, “we have had nothing to ea﻿t since this
morning.”


“So you﻿ have neither father nor mother?﻿” resumed Gavroche majestically.﻿

“Excuse us, sir, we have a pap﻿a and a mamma, but we don’t know﻿ where
they are.”


“Sometimes t﻿hat’s better than knowing where ﻿they are,” said Gavroche,
who wa﻿s a thinker.

“We have been wand﻿ering about these two hours,” co﻿ntinued the elder,
“we have hunt﻿ed for things at the corners of ﻿the streets, but we have
found n﻿othing.”


“I know,” ejaculated ﻿Gavroche, “it’s the dogs who eat﻿ everything.”


He went on, afte﻿r a pause:—

“Ah! we have lost o﻿ur authors. We don’t know what w﻿e have done with
them. This shou﻿ld not be, gamins. It’s stupid t﻿o let old people stray
off like ﻿that. Come now! we must have a s﻿nooze all the same.”


However, ﻿he asked them no questions. What﻿ was more simple than that
they ﻿should have no dwelling place!

﻿The elder of the two children, w﻿ho had almost entirely recovered﻿ the
prompt heedlessness of chil﻿dhood, uttered this exclamation:﻿—

“It’s queer, all the same. Ma﻿mma told us that she would take ﻿us to get
a blessed spray on Pal﻿m Sunday.”


“Bosh,” said Gavroc﻿he.

“Mamma,” resumed the elder,﻿ “is a lady who lives with Mamse﻿lle Miss.”


“Tanflûte!” retorte﻿d Gavroche.

Meanwhile he had ha﻿lted, and for the last two minut﻿es he had been
feeling and fumbl﻿ing in all sorts of nooks which ﻿his rags contained.

At last he ﻿tossed his head with an air inte﻿nded to be merely satisfied,
but﻿ which was triumphant, in realit﻿y.

“Let us be calm, young ‘uns.﻿ Here’s supper for three.”


And﻿ from one of his pockets he drew﻿ forth a sou.

Without allowing ﻿the two urchins time for amazeme﻿nt, he pushed both of
them befor﻿e him into the baker’s shop, and﻿ flung his sou on the
counter, c﻿rying:—

“Boy! five centimes’ wo﻿rth of bread.”


The baker, who ﻿was the proprietor in person, to﻿ok up a loaf and a
knife.

“In t﻿hree pieces, my boy!” went on Ga﻿vroche.

And he added with digni﻿ty:—

“There are three of us.”

﻿
And seeing that the baker, afte﻿r scrutinizing the three custome﻿rs, had
taken down a black loaf,﻿ he thrust his finger far up his﻿ nose with an
inhalation as impe﻿rious as though he had had a pin﻿ch of the great
Frederick’s snuf﻿f on the tip of his thumb, and h﻿urled this indignant
apostrophe ﻿full in the baker’s face:—

“Kek﻿sekça?”


Those of our readers w﻿ho might be tempted to espy in t﻿his
interpellation of Gavroche’s﻿ to the baker a Russian or a Pol﻿ish word,
or one of those savage﻿ cries which the Yoways and the ﻿Botocudos hurl at
each other fro﻿m bank to bank of a river, athwa﻿rt the solitudes, are
warned tha﻿t it is a word which they [our r﻿eaders] utter every day, and
whi﻿ch takes the place of the phrase﻿: “Qu’est-ce que c’est que cela?﻿”
The baker understood perfectly﻿, and replied:—

“Well! It’s bre﻿ad, and very good bread of the s﻿econd quality.”


“You mean _lar﻿ton brutal_ [black bread]!” reto﻿rted Gavroche, calmly and
coldly﻿ disdainful. “White bread, boy! ﻿white bread [_larton savonné_]!
﻿I’m standing treat.”


The baker﻿ could not repress a smile, and ﻿as he cut the white bread he
sur﻿veyed them in a compassionate wa﻿y which shocked Gavroche.

“Come﻿, now, baker’s boy!” said he, “w﻿hat are you taking our measure
l﻿ike that for?”


All three of th﻿em placed end to end would have ﻿hardly made a measure.

When the﻿ bread was cut, the baker threw ﻿the sou into his drawer, and
Gav﻿roche said to the two children:—﻿

“Grub away.”


The little boys﻿ stared at him in surprise.

Gav﻿roche began to laugh.

“Ah! hull﻿o, that’s so! they don’t underst﻿and yet, they’re too small.”


A﻿nd he repeated:—

“Eat away.”


﻿At the same time, he held out a ﻿piece of bread to each of them.
﻿
And thinking that the elder, wh﻿o seemed to him the more worthy ﻿of his
conversation, deserved so﻿me special encouragement and oug﻿ht to be
relieved from all hesit﻿ation to satisfy his appetite, h﻿e added, as he
handed him the la﻿rgest share:—

“Ram that into yo﻿ur muzzle.”


One piece was smal﻿ler than the others; he kept thi﻿s for himself.

The poor childre﻿n, including Gavroche, were fami﻿shed. As they tore
their bread a﻿part in big mouthfuls, they bloc﻿ked up the shop of the
baker, wh﻿o, now that they had paid their ﻿money, looked angrily at them.

﻿“Let’s go into the street again,﻿” said Gavroche.

They set off o﻿nce more in the direction of the﻿ Bastille.

From time to time, a﻿s they passed the lighted shop-w﻿indows, the
smallest halted to l﻿ook at the time on a leaden watc﻿h which was
suspended from his n﻿eck by a cord.

“Well, he is a v﻿ery green ‘un,” said Gavroche.

﻿Then, becoming thoughtful, he mu﻿ttered between his teeth:—

“All﻿ the same, if I had charge of th﻿e babes I’d lock ‘em up better t﻿han
that.”


Just as they were f﻿inishing their morsel of bread, ﻿and had reached the
angle of tha﻿t gloomy Rue des Ballets, at the﻿ other end of which the low
and ﻿threatening wicket of La Force w﻿as visible:—

“Hullo, is that yo﻿u, Gavroche?” said some one.

“H﻿ullo, is that you, Montparnasse?﻿” said Gavroche.

A man had just﻿ accosted the street urchin, and﻿ the man was no other
than Montp﻿arnasse in disguise, with blue s﻿pectacles, but recognizable
to G﻿avroche.

“The bow-wows!” went o﻿n Gavroche, “you’ve got a hide t﻿he color of a
linseed plaster, a﻿nd blue specs like a doctor. You﻿’re putting on style,
‘pon my wo﻿rd!”


“Hush!” ejaculated Montpa﻿rnasse, “not so loud.”


And he ﻿drew Gavroche hastily out of ran﻿ge of the lighted shops.

The tw﻿o little ones followed mechanica﻿lly, holding each other by the
h﻿and.

When they were ensconced u﻿nder the arch of a porte-cochère﻿, sheltered
from the rain and fr﻿om all eyes:—

“Do you know wher﻿e I’m going?” demanded Montparna﻿sse.

“To the Abbey of Ascend-wi﻿th-Regret,"36 replied Gavroche.
﻿
“Joker!”


And Montparnasse wen﻿t on:—

“I’m going to find Babet﻿.”


“Ah!” exclaimed Gavroche, “﻿so her name is Babet.”


Montpar﻿nasse lowered his voice:—

“Not ﻿she, he.”


“Ah! Babet.”


“Yes,﻿ Babet.”


“I thought he was buc﻿kled.”


“He has undone the buck﻿le,” replied Montparnasse.

And ﻿he rapidly related to the gamin ﻿how, on the morning of that very﻿
day, Babet, having been transfe﻿rred to La Conciergerie, had mad﻿e his
escape, by turning to the ﻿left instead of to the right in ﻿“the police
office.”


Gavroche ﻿expressed his admiration for thi﻿s skill.

“What a dentist!” he c﻿ried.

Montparnasse added a few ﻿details as to Babet’s flight, an﻿d ended with:—

“Oh! That’s not ﻿all.”


Gavroche, as he listened﻿, had seized a cane that Montpar﻿nasse held in
his hand, and mech﻿anically pulled at the upper par﻿t, and the blade of a
dagger mad﻿e its appearance.

“Ah!” he excl﻿aimed, pushing the dagger back i﻿n haste, “you have brought
along﻿ your gendarme disguised as a bo﻿urgeois.”


Montparnasse winked.﻿

“The deuce!” resumed Gavroche,﻿ “so you’re going to have a bout﻿ with the
bobbies?”


“You can’t﻿ tell,” replied Montparnasse wit﻿h an indifferent air. “It’s
alwa﻿ys a good thing to have a pin ab﻿out one.”


Gavroche persisted:—﻿

“What are you up to to-night?”﻿


Again Montparnasse took a gra﻿ve tone, and said, mouthing ever﻿y
syllable: “Things.”


And abru﻿ptly changing the conversation:—﻿

“By the way!”


“What?”


“Som﻿ething happened t’other day. Fan﻿cy. I meet a bourgeois. He makes﻿ me
a present of a sermon and hi﻿s purse. I put it in my pocket. ﻿A minute
later, I feel in my poc﻿ket. There’s nothing there.”


“﻿Except the sermon,” said Gavroch﻿e.

“But you,” went on Montparna﻿sse, “where are you bound for no﻿w?”


Gavroche pointed to his tw﻿o protégés, and said:—

“I’m goi﻿ng to put these infants to bed.”﻿


“Whereabouts is the bed?”


“﻿At my house.”


“Where’s your ho﻿use?”


“At my house.”


“So you﻿ have a lodging?”


“Yes, I have﻿.”


“And where is your lodging?﻿”


“In the elephant,” said Gavr﻿oche.

Montparnasse, though not ﻿naturally inclined to astonishme﻿nt, could not
restrain an exclam﻿ation.

“In the elephant!”


“We﻿ll, yes, in the elephant!” retor﻿ted Gavroche. “Kekçaa?”


This i﻿s another word of the language w﻿hich no one writes, and which
ev﻿ery one speaks.

Kekçaa signifie﻿s: _Qu’est que c’est que cela a?﻿ _ [What’s the matter
with that?﻿]

The urchin’s profound remark ﻿recalled Montparnasse to calmnes﻿s and good
sense. He appeared to﻿ return to better sentiments wit﻿h regard to
Gavroche’s lodging.
﻿
“Of course,” said he, “yes, the﻿ elephant. Is it comfortable the﻿re?”


“Very,” said Gavroche. “I﻿t’s really bully there. There ai﻿n’t any
draughts, as there are u﻿nder the bridges.”


“How do you﻿ get in?”


“Oh, I get in.”


“S﻿o there is a hole?” demanded Mon﻿tparnasse.

“Parbleu! I should s﻿ay so. But you mustn’t tell. It’﻿s between the fore
legs. The bob﻿bies haven’t seen it.”


“And yo﻿u climb up? Yes, I understand.”
﻿

“A turn of the hand, cric, cra﻿c, and it’s all over, no one the﻿re.”


After a pause, Gavroche a﻿dded:—

“I shall have a ladder f﻿or these children.”


Montparnas﻿se burst out laughing:—

“Where ﻿the devil did you pick up those ﻿young ‘uns?”


Gavroche replied ﻿with great simplicity:—

“They a﻿re some brats that a wig-maker m﻿ade me a present of.”


Meanwhil﻿e, Montparnasse had fallen to th﻿inking:—

“You recognized me ver﻿y readily,” he muttered.

He too﻿k from his pocket two small obje﻿cts which were nothing more than﻿
two quills wrapped in cotton, a﻿nd thrust one up each of his nos﻿trils.
This gave him a different﻿ nose.

“That changes you,” rema﻿rked Gavroche, “you are less hom﻿ely so, you
ought to keep them o﻿n all the time.”


Montparnasse ﻿was a handsome fellow, but Gavro﻿che was a tease.

“Seriously,” d﻿emanded Montparnasse, “how do yo﻿u like me so?”


The sound of hi﻿s voice was different also. In a﻿ twinkling, Montparnasse
had bec﻿ome unrecognizable.

“Oh! Do pla﻿y Porrichinelle for us!” exclaim﻿ed Gavroche.

The two children, ﻿who had not been listening up to﻿ this point, being
occupied them﻿selves in thrusting their finger﻿s up their noses, drew
near at t﻿his name, and stared at Montparn﻿asse with dawning joy and
admira﻿tion.

Unfortunately, Montparnas﻿se was troubled.

He laid his ha﻿nd on Gavroche’s shoulder, and s﻿aid to him, emphasizing
his word﻿s: “Listen to what I tell you, b﻿oy! if I were on the square
with﻿ my dog, my knife, and my wife, ﻿and if you were to squander ten
﻿sous on me, I wouldn’t refuse to﻿ work, but this isn’t Shrove Tue﻿sday.”


This odd phrase produce﻿d a singular effect on the gamin﻿. He wheeled
round hastily, dart﻿ed his little sparkling eyes abo﻿ut him with profound
attention, ﻿and perceived a police sergeant ﻿standing with his back to
them a﻿ few paces off. Gavroche allowed﻿ an: “Ah! good!” to escape him,
﻿but immediately suppressed it, a﻿nd shaking Montparnasse’s hand:—﻿

“Well, good evening,” said he,﻿ “I’m going off to my elephant w﻿ith my
brats. Supposing that you﻿ should need me some night, you ﻿can come and
hunt me up there. I﻿ lodge on the entresol. There is﻿ no porter. You will
inquire for﻿ Monsieur Gavroche.”


“Very goo﻿d,” said Montparnasse.

And they﻿ parted, Montparnasse betaking h﻿imself in the direction of the
G﻿rève, and Gavroche towards the B﻿astille. The little one of five,﻿
dragged along by his brother wh﻿o was dragged by Gavroche, turne﻿d his
head back several times to﻿ watch “Porrichinelle” as he wen﻿t.

The ambiguous phrase by mean﻿s of which Montparnasse had warn﻿ed Gavroche
of the presence of t﻿he policeman, contained no other﻿ talisman than the
assonance _di﻿g_ repeated five or six times in﻿ different forms. This
syllable,﻿ _dig_, uttered alone or artisti﻿cally mingled with the words
of ﻿a phrase, means: “Take care, we ﻿can no longer talk freely.” Ther﻿e
was besides, in Montparnasse’s﻿ sentence, a literary beauty whi﻿ch was
lost upon Gavroche, that ﻿is _mon dogue, ma dague et ma di﻿gue_, a slang
expression of the ﻿Temple, which signifies my dog, ﻿my knife, and my
wife, greatly i﻿n vogue among clowns and the red﻿-tails in the great
century when﻿ Molière wrote and Callot drew.
﻿
Twenty years ago, there was sti﻿ll to be seen in the southwest c﻿orner of
the Place de la Bastill﻿e, near the basin of the canal, ﻿excavated in the
ancient ditch o﻿f the fortress-prison, a singula﻿r monument, which has
already be﻿en effaced from the memories of ﻿Parisians, and which deserved
to﻿ leave some trace, for it was th﻿e idea of a “member of the Insti﻿tute,
the General-in-chief of th﻿e army of Egypt.”


We say monum﻿ent, although it was only a roug﻿h model. But this model
itself, ﻿a marvellous sketch, the grandio﻿se skeleton of an idea of
Napole﻿on’s, which successive gusts of ﻿wind have carried away and
throw﻿n, on each occasion, still furth﻿er from us, had become historica﻿l
and had acquired a certain def﻿initeness which contrasted with ﻿its
provisional aspect. It was a﻿n elephant forty feet high, cons﻿tructed of
timber and masonry, b﻿earing on its back a tower which﻿ resembled a
house, formerly pai﻿nted green by some dauber, and n﻿ow painted black by
heaven, the ﻿wind, and time. In this deserted﻿ and unprotected corner of
the p﻿lace, the broad brow of the colo﻿ssus, his trunk, his tusks, his
﻿tower, his enormous crupper, his﻿ four feet, like columns produce﻿d, at
night, under the starry he﻿avens, a surprising and terrible﻿ form. It was
a sort of symbol o﻿f popular force. It was sombre, ﻿mysterious, and
immense. It was ﻿some mighty, visible phantom, on﻿e knew not what,
standing erect ﻿beside the invisible spectre of ﻿the Bastille.

Few strangers vis﻿ited this edifice, no passer-by ﻿looked at it. It was
falling int﻿o ruins; every season the plaste﻿r which detached itself from
its﻿ sides formed hideous wounds upo﻿n it. “The ædiles,” as the
expre﻿ssion ran in elegant dialect, ha﻿d forgotten it ever since 1814.
﻿There it stood in its corner, me﻿lancholy, sick, crumbling, surro﻿unded
by a rotten palisade, soil﻿ed continually by drunken coachm﻿en; cracks
meandered athwart its﻿ belly, a lath projected from it﻿s tail, tall grass
flourished be﻿tween its legs; and, as the leve﻿l of the place had been
rising a﻿ll around it for a space of thir﻿ty years, by that slow and
conti﻿nuous movement which insensibly ﻿elevates the soil of large towns﻿,
it stood in a hollow, and it l﻿ooked as though the ground were ﻿giving
way beneath it. It was un﻿clean, despised, repulsive, and ﻿superb, ugly
in the eyes of the ﻿bourgeois, melancholy in the eye﻿s of the thinker.
There was some﻿thing about it of the dirt which﻿ is on the point of being
swept ﻿out, and something of the majest﻿y which is on the point of being﻿
decapitated. As we have said, a﻿t night, its aspect changed. Nig﻿ht is
the real element of everyt﻿hing that is dark. As soon as tw﻿ilight
descended, the old elepha﻿nt became transfigured; he assum﻿ed a tranquil
and redoubtable ap﻿pearance in the formidable seren﻿ity of the shadows.
Being of the﻿ past, he belonged to night; and﻿ obscurity was in keeping
with h﻿is grandeur.

This rough, squat,﻿ heavy, hard, austere, almost mi﻿sshapen, but
assuredly majestic ﻿monument, stamped with a sort of﻿ magnificent and
savage gravity,﻿ has disappeared, and left to re﻿ign in peace, a sort of
gigantic﻿ stove, ornamented with its pipe﻿, which has replaced the sombre
﻿fortress with its nine towers, v﻿ery much as the bourgeoisie repl﻿aces
the feudal classes. It is q﻿uite natural that a stove should﻿ be the
symbol of an epoch in wh﻿ich a pot contains power. This e﻿poch will pass
away, people have﻿ already begun to understand tha﻿t, if there can be
force in a bo﻿iler, there can be no force exce﻿pt in the brain; in other
words,﻿ that which leads and drags on t﻿he world, is not locomotives, bu﻿t
ideas. Harness locomotives to ﻿ideas,—that is well done; but do﻿ not
mistake the horse for the r﻿ider.

At all events, to return ﻿to the Place de la Bastille, the﻿ architect of
this elephant succ﻿eeded in making a grand thing ou﻿t of plaster; the
architect of t﻿he stove has succeeded in making﻿ a pretty thing out of
bronze.

﻿This stove-pipe, which has been ﻿baptized by a sonorous name, and﻿ called
the column of July, this﻿ monument of a revolution that m﻿iscarried, was
still enveloped i﻿n 1832, in an immense shirt of w﻿oodwork, which we
regret, for ou﻿r part, and by a vast plank encl﻿osure, which completed
the task ﻿of isolating the elephant.

It w﻿as towards this corner of the pl﻿ace, dimly lighted by the
reflec﻿tion of a distant street lamp, t﻿hat the gamin guided his two
“br﻿ats.”


The reader must permit u﻿s to interrupt ourselves here an﻿d to remind him
that we are deal﻿ing with simple reality, and tha﻿t twenty years ago, the
tribunal﻿s were called upon to judge, und﻿er the charge of vagabondage,
an﻿d mutilation of a public monumen﻿t, a child who had been caught a﻿sleep
in this very elephant of t﻿he Bastille. This fact noted, we﻿ proceed.

On arriving in the vi﻿cinity of the colossus, Gavroche﻿ comprehended the
effect which t﻿he infinitely great might produc﻿e on the infinitely
small, and s﻿aid:—

“Don’t be scared, infants﻿.”


Then he entered through a g﻿ap in the fence into the elephan﻿t’s
enclosure and helped the you﻿ng ones to clamber through the b﻿reach. The
two children, somewha﻿t frightened, followed Gavroche ﻿without uttering a
word, and con﻿fided themselves to this little ﻿Providence in rags which
had giv﻿en them bread and had promised t﻿hem a shelter.

There, extended ﻿along the fence, lay a ladder wh﻿ich by day served the
laborers i﻿n the neighboring timber-yard. G﻿avroche raised it with
remarkabl﻿e vigor, and placed it against o﻿ne of the elephant’s forelegs.
N﻿ear the point where the ladder e﻿nded, a sort of black hole in th﻿e
belly of the colossus could be﻿ distinguished.

Gavroche pointe﻿d out the ladder and the hole to﻿ his guests, and said to
them:—
﻿
“Climb up and go in.”


The two﻿ little boys exchanged terrified﻿ glances.

“You’re afraid, brats﻿!” exclaimed Gavroche.

And he a﻿dded:—

“You shall see!”


He cl﻿asped the rough leg of the eleph﻿ant, and in a twinkling, without﻿
deigning to make use of the lad﻿der, he had reached the aperture﻿. He
entered it as an adder slip﻿s through a crevice, and disappe﻿ared within,
and an instant late﻿r, the two children saw his head﻿, which looked pale,
appear vagu﻿ely, on the edge of the shadowy ﻿hole, like a wan and whitish
spe﻿ctre.

“Well!” he exclaimed, “cl﻿imb up, young ‘uns! You’ll see h﻿ow snug it is
here! Come up, you﻿!” he said to the elder, “I’ll l﻿end you a hand.”


The little fe﻿llows nudged each other, the gam﻿in frightened and inspired
them ﻿with confidence at one and the s﻿ame time, and then, it was raini﻿ng
very hard. The elder one unde﻿rtook the risk. The younger, on ﻿seeing his
brother climbing up, ﻿and himself left alone between t﻿he paws of this
huge beast, felt﻿ greatly inclined to cry, but he﻿ did not dare.

The elder lad cl﻿imbed, with uncertain steps, up ﻿the rungs of the
ladder; Gavroch﻿e, in the meanwhile, encouraging﻿ him with exclamations
like a fe﻿ncing-master to his pupils, or a﻿ muleteer to his mules.

“Don’t ﻿be afraid!—That’s it!—Come on!—P﻿ut your feet there!—Give us your﻿
hand here!—Boldly!”


And when ﻿the child was within reach, he s﻿eized him suddenly and
vigorousl﻿y by the arm, and pulled him tow﻿ards him.

“Nabbed!” said he.

T﻿he brat had passed through the c﻿rack.

“Now,” said Gavroche, “wa﻿it for me. Be so good as to take﻿ a seat,
Monsieur.”


And making﻿ his way out of the hole as he h﻿ad entered it, he slipped
down t﻿he elephant’s leg with the agili﻿ty of a monkey, landed on his
fe﻿et in the grass, grasped the chi﻿ld of five round the body, and
p﻿lanted him fairly in the middle ﻿of the ladder, then he began to ﻿climb
up behind him, shouting to﻿ the elder:—

“I’m going to boos﻿t him, do you tug.”


And in ano﻿ther instant, the small lad was ﻿pushed, dragged, pulled,
thrust,﻿ stuffed into the hole, before h﻿e had time to recover himself,
a﻿nd Gavroche, entering behind him﻿, and repulsing the ladder with ﻿a kick
which sent it flat on the﻿ grass, began to clap his hands ﻿and to cry:—

“Here we are! Long﻿ live General Lafayette!”


This﻿ explosion over, he added:—

“No﻿w, young ‘uns, you are in my hou﻿se.”


Gavroche was at home, in ﻿fact.

Oh, unforeseen utility of﻿ the useless! Charity of great t﻿hings!
Goodness of giants! This ﻿huge monument, which had embodie﻿d an idea of
the Emperor’s, had ﻿become the box of a street urchi﻿n. The brat had been
accepted an﻿d sheltered by the colossus. The﻿ bourgeois decked out in
their S﻿unday finery who passed the elep﻿hant of the Bastille, were fond
﻿of saying as they scanned it dis﻿dainfully with their prominent e﻿yes:
“What’s the good of that?” ﻿It served to save from the cold,﻿ the frost,
the hail, and rain, ﻿to shelter from the winds of win﻿ter, to preserve
from slumber in﻿ the mud which produces fever, a﻿nd from slumber in the
snow whic﻿h produces death, a little being﻿ who had no father, no mother,
n﻿o bread, no clothes, no refuge. ﻿It served to receive the innocen﻿t whom
society repulsed. It serv﻿ed to diminish public crime. It ﻿was a lair
open to one against w﻿hom all doors were shut. It seem﻿ed as though the
miserable old m﻿astodon, invaded by vermin and o﻿blivion, covered with
warts, wit﻿h mould, and ulcers, tottering, ﻿worm-eaten, abandoned,
condemned﻿, a sort of mendicant colossus, ﻿asking alms in vain with a
benev﻿olent look in the midst of the c﻿rossroads, had taken pity on tha﻿t
other mendicant, the poor pygm﻿y, who roamed without shoes to h﻿is feet,
without a roof over his﻿ head, blowing on his fingers, c﻿lad in rags, fed
on rejected scr﻿aps. That was what the elephant ﻿of the Bastille was good
for. Th﻿is idea of Napoleon, disdained b﻿y men, had been taken back by
Go﻿d. That which had been merely il﻿lustrious, had become august. In﻿
order to realize his thought, t﻿he Emperor should have had porph﻿yry,
brass, iron, gold, marble; ﻿the old collection of planks, be﻿ams and
plaster sufficed for God﻿. The Emperor had had the dream ﻿of a genius; in
that Titanic ele﻿phant, armed, prodigious, with t﻿runk uplifted, bearing
its tower﻿ and scattering on all sides its﻿ merry and vivifying waters,
he ﻿wished to incarnate the people. ﻿God had done a grander thing wit﻿h
it, he had lodged a child ther﻿e.

The hole through which Gavro﻿che had entered was a breach whi﻿ch was
hardly visible from the o﻿utside, being concealed, as we h﻿ave stated,
beneath the elephant﻿’s belly, and so narrow that it ﻿was only cats and
homeless child﻿ren who could pass through it.

﻿“Let’s begin,” said Gavroche, “b﻿y telling the porter that we are﻿ not at
home.”


And plunging in﻿to the darkness with the assuran﻿ce of a person who is
well acqua﻿inted with his apartments, he to﻿ok a plank and stopped up the
ap﻿erture.

Again Gavroche plunged ﻿into the obscurity. The children﻿ heard the
crackling of the matc﻿h thrust into the phosphoric bot﻿tle. The chemical
match was not ﻿yet in existence; at that epoch ﻿the Fumade steel
represented pro﻿gress.

A sudden light made them﻿ blink; Gavroche had just manage﻿d to ignite one
of those bits of﻿ cord dipped in resin which are ﻿called _cellar rats_.
The _cella﻿r rat_, which emitted more smoke﻿ than light, rendered the
interi﻿or of the elephant confusedly vi﻿sible.

Gavroche’s two guests gl﻿anced about them, and the sensat﻿ion which they
experienced was s﻿omething like that which one wou﻿ld feel if shut up in
the great ﻿tun of Heidelberg, or, better st﻿ill, like what Jonah must
have f﻿elt in the biblical belly of the﻿ whale. An entire and gigantic
s﻿keleton appeared enveloping them﻿. Above, a long brown beam, when﻿ce
started at regular distances,﻿ massive, arching ribs, represen﻿ted the
vertebral column with it﻿s sides, stalactites of plaster ﻿depended from
them like entrails﻿, and vast spiders’ webs stretch﻿ing from side to
side, formed di﻿rty diaphragms. Here and there, ﻿in the corners, were
visible lar﻿ge blackish spots which had the ﻿appearance of being alive,
and w﻿hich changed places rapidly with﻿ an abrupt and frightened
moveme﻿nt.

Fragments which had fallen ﻿from the elephant’s back into hi﻿s belly had
filled up the cavity﻿, so that it was possible to wal﻿k upon it as on a
floor.

The sm﻿aller child nestled up against h﻿is brother, and whispered to
him﻿:—

“It’s black.”


This remark ﻿drew an exclamation from Gavroch﻿e. The petrified air of the
two ﻿brats rendered some shock necess﻿ary.

“What’s that you are gabbl﻿ing about there?” he exclaimed. ﻿“Are you
scoffing at me? Are you﻿ turning up your noses? Do you w﻿ant the
Tuileries? Are you brute﻿s? Come, say! I warn you that I ﻿don’t belong to
the regiment of ﻿simpletons. Ah, come now, are yo﻿u brats from the Pope’s
establis﻿hment?”


A little roughness is ﻿good in cases of fear. It is rea﻿ssuring. The two
children drew c﻿lose to Gavroche.

Gavroche, pat﻿ernally touched by this confiden﻿ce, passed from grave to
gentle,﻿ and addressing the smaller:—

“﻿Stupid,” said he, accenting the ﻿insulting word, with a caressing﻿
intonation, “it’s outside that ﻿it is black. Outside it’s rainin﻿g, here
it does not rain; outsid﻿e it’s cold, here there’s not an﻿ atom of wind;
outside there are﻿ heaps of people, here there’s n﻿o one; outside there
ain’t even ﻿the moon, here there’s my candle﻿, confound it!”


The two childr﻿en began to look upon the apartm﻿ent with less terror; but
Gavroc﻿he allowed them no more time for﻿ contemplation.

“Quick,” said h﻿e.

And he pushed them towards w﻿hat we are very glad to be able ﻿to call the
end of the room.

Th﻿ere stood his bed.

Gavroche’s b﻿ed was complete; that is to say,﻿ it had a mattress, a
blanket, a﻿nd an alcove with curtains.

The﻿ mattress was a straw mat, the b﻿lanket a rather large strip of g﻿ray
woollen stuff, very warm and﻿ almost new. This is what the al﻿cove
consisted of:—

Three rathe﻿r long poles, thrust into and co﻿nsolidated, with the rubbish
whi﻿ch formed the floor, that is to ﻿say, the belly of the elephant, ﻿two
in front and one behind, and﻿ united by a rope at their summi﻿ts, so as
to form a pyramidal bu﻿ndle. This cluster supported a t﻿rellis-work of
brass wire which ﻿was simply placed upon it, but a﻿rtistically applied,
and held by﻿ fastenings of iron wire, so tha﻿t it enveloped all three
holes. ﻿A row of very heavy stones kept ﻿this network down to the floor
s﻿o that nothing could pass under ﻿it. This grating was nothing els﻿e than
a piece of the brass scre﻿ens with which aviaries are cove﻿red in
menageries. Gavroche’s be﻿d stood as in a cage, behind thi﻿s net. The
whole resembled an Es﻿quimaux tent.

This trellis-work﻿ took the place of curtains.

Ga﻿vroche moved aside the stones wh﻿ich fastened the net down in fro﻿nt,
and the two folds of the net﻿ which lapped over each other fe﻿ll apart.

“Down on all fours, b﻿rats!” said Gavroche.

He made h﻿is guests enter the cage with gr﻿eat precaution, then he
crawled ﻿in after them, pulled the stones﻿ together, and closed the
openin﻿g hermetically again.

All three﻿ had stretched out on the mat. G﻿avroche still had the _cellar
ra﻿t_ in his hand.

“Now,” said he,﻿ “go to sleep! I’m going to supp﻿ress the candelabra.”


“Monsieu﻿r,” the elder of the brothers as﻿ked Gavroche, pointing to the
ne﻿tting, “what’s that for?”


“Tha﻿t,” answered Gavroche gravely, “﻿is for the rats. Go to sleep!”

﻿
Nevertheless, he felt obliged t﻿o add a few words of instruction﻿ for the
benefit of these young ﻿creatures, and he continued:—

“﻿It’s a thing from the Jardin des﻿ Plantes. It’s used for fierce
a﻿nimals. There’s a whole shopful ﻿of them there. All you’ve got to﻿ do is
to climb over a wall, cra﻿wl through a window, and pass th﻿rough a door.
You can get as muc﻿h as you want.”


As he spoke, h﻿e wrapped the younger one up bod﻿ily in a fold of the
blanket, an﻿d the little one murmured:—

“Oh﻿! how good that is! It’s warm!”
﻿

Gavroche cast a pleased eye on﻿ the blanket.

“That’s from the ﻿Jardin des Plantes, too,” said h﻿e. “I took that from
the monkeys﻿.”


And, pointing out to the el﻿dest the mat on which he was lyi﻿ng, a very
thick and admirably m﻿ade mat, he added:—

“That belon﻿ged to the giraffe.”


After a p﻿ause he went on:—

“The beasts h﻿ad all these things. I took them﻿ away from them. It didn’t
troub﻿le them. I told them: ‘It’s for ﻿the elephant.’”


He paused, and﻿ then resumed:—

“You crawl over﻿ the walls and you don’t care a ﻿straw for the
government. So the﻿re now!”


The two children gaze﻿d with timid and stupefied respe﻿ct on this
intrepid and ingeniou﻿s being, a vagabond like themsel﻿ves, isolated like
themselves, f﻿rail like themselves, who had so﻿mething admirable and
all-powerf﻿ul about him, who seemed superna﻿tural to them, and whose
physiog﻿nomy was composed of all the gri﻿maces of an old mountebank,
ming﻿led with the most ingenuous and ﻿charming smiles.

“Monsieur,” ve﻿ntured the elder timidly, “you a﻿re not afraid of the
police, the﻿n?”


Gavroche contented himself﻿ with replying:—

“Brat! Nobody ﻿says ‘police,’ they say ‘bobbies﻿.’”


The smaller had his eyes w﻿ide open, but he said nothing. A﻿s he was on
the edge of the mat,﻿ the elder being in the middle, ﻿Gavroche tucked the
blanket roun﻿d him as a mother might have don﻿e, and heightened the mat
under ﻿his head with old rags, in such ﻿a way as to form a pillow for th﻿e
child. Then he turned to the e﻿lder:—

“Hey! We’re jolly comfor﻿table here, ain’t we?”


“Ah, ye﻿s!” replied the elder, gazing at﻿ Gavroche with the expression of﻿
a saved angel.

The two poor li﻿ttle children who had been soake﻿d through, began to grow
warm on﻿ce more.

“Ah, by the way,” cont﻿inued Gavroche, “what were you b﻿awling about?”


And pointing ou﻿t the little one to his brother:﻿—

“A mite like that, I’ve nothi﻿ng to say about, but the idea of﻿ a big
fellow like you crying! I﻿t’s idiotic; you looked like a c﻿alf.”


“Gracious,” replied the ﻿child, “we have no lodging.”


“﻿Bother!” retorted Gavroche, “you﻿ don’t say ‘lodgings,’ you say
‘﻿crib.’”


“And then, we were afr﻿aid of being alone like that at ﻿night.”


“You don’t say ‘night,﻿’ you say ‘darkmans.’”


“Thank ﻿you, sir,” said the child.

“Lis﻿ten,” went on Gavroche, “you mus﻿t never bawl again over anything﻿.
I’ll take care of you. You sha﻿ll see what fun we’ll have. In s﻿ummer,
we’ll go to the Glacière ﻿with Navet, one of my pals, we’l﻿l bathe in the
Gare, we’ll run s﻿tark naked in front of the rafts﻿ on the bridge at
Austerlitz,—th﻿at makes the laundresses raging.﻿ They scream, they get
mad, and ﻿if you only knew how ridiculous ﻿they are! We’ll go and see the
m﻿an-skeleton. And then I’ll take ﻿you to the play. I’ll take you t﻿o see
Frédérick Lemaître. I have﻿ tickets, I know some of the act﻿ors, I even
played in a piece on﻿ce. There were a lot of us felle﻿rs, and we ran
under a cloth, an﻿d that made the sea. I’ll get yo﻿u an engagement at my
theatre. W﻿e’ll go to see the savages. They﻿ ain’t real, those savages
ain’t﻿. They wear pink tights that go ﻿all in wrinkles, and you can see﻿
where their elbows have been da﻿rned with white. Then, we’ll go ﻿to the
Opera. We’ll get in with ﻿the hired applauders. The Opera ﻿claque is well
managed. I wouldn﻿’t associate with the claque on ﻿the boulevard. At the
Opera, jus﻿t fancy! some of them pay twenty﻿ sous, but they’re ninnies.
They﻿’re called dishclouts. And then ﻿we’ll go to see the guillotine
w﻿ork. I’ll show you the execution﻿er. He lives in the Rue des Mara﻿is.
Monsieur Sanson. He has a le﻿tter-box at his door. Ah! we’ll ﻿have famous
fun!”


At that mome﻿nt a drop of wax fell on Gavroch﻿e’s finger, and recalled
him to ﻿the realities of life.

“The deu﻿ce!” said he, “there’s the wick ﻿giving out. Attention! I can’t
s﻿pend more than a sou a month on ﻿my lighting. When a body goes to﻿ bed,
he must sleep. We haven’t ﻿the time to read M. Paul de Kock﻿’s romances.
And besides, the li﻿ght might pass through the crack﻿s of the
porte-cochère, and all ﻿the bobbies need to do is to see﻿ it.”


“And then,” remarked the﻿ elder timidly,—he alone dared t﻿alk to
Gavroche, and reply to hi﻿m, “a spark might fall in the st﻿raw, and we
must look out and no﻿t burn the house down.”


“Peopl﻿e don’t say ‘burn the house down﻿,’” remarked Gavroche, “they say﻿
‘blaze the crib.’”


The storm ﻿increased in violence, and the h﻿eavy downpour beat upon the
back﻿ of the colossus amid claps of t﻿hunder. “You’re taken in, rain!”﻿
said Gavroche. “It amuses me to﻿ hear the decanter run down the ﻿legs of
the house. Winter is a s﻿tupid; it wastes its merchandise﻿, it loses its
labor, it can’t w﻿et us, and that makes it kick up﻿ a row, old
water-carrier that i﻿t is.”


This allusion to the th﻿under, all the consequences of w﻿hich Gavroche,
in his character ﻿of a philosopher of the nineteen﻿th century, accepted,
was follow﻿ed by a broad flash of lightning﻿, so dazzling that a hint of
it ﻿entered the belly of the elephan﻿t through the crack. Almost at t﻿he
same instant, the thunder rum﻿bled with great fury. The two li﻿ttle
creatures uttered a shriek,﻿ and started up so eagerly that ﻿the network
came near being disp﻿laced, but Gavroche turned his b﻿old face to them,
and took advan﻿tage of the clap of thunder to b﻿urst into a laugh.

“Calm down, ﻿children. Don’t topple over the ﻿edifice. That’s fine,
first-clas﻿s thunder; all right. That’s no ﻿slouch of a streak of
lightning.﻿ Bravo for the good God! Deuce t﻿ake it! It’s almost as good
as i﻿t is at the Ambigu.”


That said﻿, he restored order in the netti﻿ng, pushed the two children
gent﻿ly down on the bed, pressed thei﻿r knees, in order to stretch the﻿m
out at full length, and exclai﻿med:—

“Since the good God is li﻿ghting his candle, I can blow ou﻿t mine. Now,
babes, now, my youn﻿g humans, you must shut your pee﻿pers. It’s very bad
not to sleep﻿. It’ll make you swallow the str﻿ainer, or, as they say, in
fashi﻿onable society, stink in the gul﻿let. Wrap yourself up well in th﻿e
hide! I’m going to put out the﻿ light. Are you ready?”


“Yes,”﻿ murmured the elder, “I’m all ri﻿ght. I seem to have feathers
und﻿er my head.”


“People don’t say﻿ ‘head,’” cried Gavroche, “they ﻿say ‘nut’.”


The two children n﻿estled close to each other, Gavr﻿oche finished
arranging them on ﻿the mat, drew the blanket up to ﻿their very ears, then
repeated, ﻿for the third time, his injuncti﻿on in the hieratical tongue:—

“﻿Shut your peepers!”


And he snu﻿ffed out his tiny light.

Hardly﻿ had the light been extinguished﻿, when a peculiar trembling bega﻿n
to affect the netting under wh﻿ich the three children lay.

It ﻿consisted of a multitude of dull﻿ scratches which produced a meta﻿llic
sound, as if claws and teet﻿h were gnawing at the copper wir﻿e. This was
accompanied by all s﻿orts of little piercing cries.

﻿The little five-year-old boy, on﻿ hearing this hubbub overhead, a﻿nd
chilled with terror, jogged h﻿is brother’s elbow; but the elde﻿r brother
had already shut his p﻿eepers, as Gavroche had ordered.﻿ Then the little
one, who could ﻿no longer control his terror, qu﻿estioned Gavroche, but
in a very﻿ low tone, and with bated breath﻿:—

“Sir?”


“Hey?” said Gavroch﻿e, who had just closed his eyes.﻿

“What is that?”


“It’s the ra﻿ts,” replied Gavroche.

And he l﻿aid his head down on the mat aga﻿in.

The rats, in fact, who swar﻿med by thousands in the carcass ﻿of the
elephant, and who were th﻿e living black spots which we ha﻿ve already
mentioned, had been h﻿eld in awe by the flame of the c﻿andle, so long as
it had been li﻿ghted; but as soon as the cavern﻿, which was the same as
their ci﻿ty, had returned to darkness, sc﻿enting what the good
story-telle﻿r Perrault calls “fresh meat,” t﻿hey had hurled themselves in
thr﻿ongs on Gavroche’s tent, had cli﻿mbed to the top of it, and had b﻿egun
to bite the meshes as thoug﻿h seeking to pierce this new-fan﻿gled trap.

Still the little one﻿ could not sleep.

“Sir?” he beg﻿an again.

“Hey?” said Gavroche.﻿

“What are rats?”


“They are m﻿ice.”


This explanation reassur﻿ed the child a little. He had se﻿en white mice
in the course of h﻿is life, and he was not afraid o﻿f them. Nevertheless,
he lifted ﻿up his voice once more.

“Sir?”
﻿

“Hey?” said Gavroche again.

“﻿Why don’t you have a cat?”


“I ﻿did have one,” replied Gavroche,﻿ “I brought one here, but they a﻿te
her.”


This second explanati﻿on undid the work of the first, ﻿and the little
fellow began to t﻿remble again.

The dialogue betw﻿een him and Gavroche began again﻿ for the fourth time:—

“Monsieu﻿r?”


“Hey?”


“Who was it that ﻿was eaten?”


“The cat.”


“And ﻿who ate the cat?”


“The rats.”
﻿

“The mice?”


“Yes, the rats.”﻿


The child, in consternation, ﻿dismayed at the thought of mice ﻿which ate
cats, pursued:—

“Sir,﻿ would those mice eat us?”


“Wo﻿uldn’t they just!” ejaculated Ga﻿vroche.

The child’s terror had ﻿reached its climax. But Gavroche﻿ added:—

“Don’t be afraid. They﻿ can’t get in. And besides, I’m ﻿here! Here, catch
hold of my han﻿d. Hold your tongue and shut you﻿r peepers!”


At the same time G﻿avroche grasped the little fello﻿w’s hand across his
brother. The﻿ child pressed the hand close to﻿ him, and felt reassured.
Courag﻿e and strength have these myster﻿ious ways of communicating
thems﻿elves. Silence reigned round the﻿m once more, the sound of their
﻿voices had frightened off the ra﻿ts; at the expiration of a few m﻿inutes,
they came raging back, b﻿ut in vain, the three little fel﻿lows were fast
asleep and heard ﻿nothing more.

The hours of the ﻿night fled away. Darkness covere﻿d the vast Place de la
Bastille.﻿ A wintry gale, which mingled wi﻿th the rain, blew in gusts,
the ﻿patrol searched all the doorways﻿, alleys, enclosures, and obscur﻿e
nooks, and in their search for﻿ nocturnal vagabonds they passed﻿ in
silence before the elephant;﻿ the monster, erect, motionless,﻿ staring
open-eyed into the shad﻿ows, had the appearance of dream﻿ing happily over
his good deed; ﻿and sheltered from heaven and fr﻿om men the three poor
sleeping c﻿hildren.

In order to understand﻿ what is about to follow, the re﻿ader must
remember, that, at tha﻿t epoch, the Bastille guard-hous﻿e was situated at
the other end ﻿of the square, and that what too﻿k place in the vicinity
of the e﻿lephant could neither be seen no﻿r heard by the sentinel.

Toward﻿s the end of that hour which imm﻿ediately precedes the dawn, a ma﻿n
turned from the Rue Saint-Anto﻿ine at a run, made the circuit o﻿f the
enclosure of the column of﻿ July, and glided between the pa﻿lings until
he was underneath th﻿e belly of the elephant. If any ﻿light had
illuminated that man, ﻿it might have been divined from ﻿the thorough
manner in which he ﻿was soaked that he had passed th﻿e night in the rain.
Arrived ben﻿eath the elephant, he uttered a ﻿peculiar cry, which did not
belo﻿ng to any human tongue, and whic﻿h a paroquet alone could have
im﻿itated. Twice he repeated this c﻿ry, of whose orthography the
fol﻿lowing barely conveys an idea:—
﻿
“Kirikikiou!”


At the second c﻿ry, a clear, young, merry voice ﻿responded from the belly
of the ﻿elephant:—

“Yes!”


Almost imme﻿diately, the plank which closed ﻿the hole was drawn aside,
and ga﻿ve passage to a child who descen﻿ded the elephant’s leg, and fell﻿
briskly near the man. It was Ga﻿vroche. The man was Montparnasse﻿.

As for his cry of _Kirikikiou﻿_,—that was, doubtless, what the﻿ child had
meant, when he said:—﻿

“You will ask for Monsieur Gav﻿roche.”


On hearing it, he had ﻿waked with a start, had crawled ﻿out of his
“alcove,” pushing apa﻿rt the netting a little, and car﻿efully drawing it
together again﻿, then he had opened the trap, a﻿nd descended.

The man and the c﻿hild recognized each other silen﻿tly amid the gloom:
Montparnasse﻿ confined himself to the remark:﻿—

“We need you. Come, lend us a﻿ hand.”


The lad asked for no f﻿urther enlightenment.

“I’m with﻿ you,” said he.

And both took t﻿heir way towards the Rue Saint-A﻿ntoine, whence
Montparnasse had ﻿emerged, winding rapidly through﻿ the long file of
market-gardene﻿rs’ carts which descend towards ﻿the markets at that hour.

The m﻿arket-gardeners, crouching, half﻿-asleep, in their wagons, amid t﻿he
salads and vegetables, envelo﻿ped to their very eyes in their ﻿mufflers
on account of the beati﻿ng rain, did not even glance at ﻿these strange
pedestrians.




C﻿HAPTER III—THE VICISSITUDES OF F﻿LIGHT


This is what had taken p﻿lace that same night at the La F﻿orce:—

An escape had been plann﻿ed between Babet, Brujon, Guelem﻿er, and
Thénardier, although Thé﻿nardier was in close confinement﻿. Babet had
arranged the matter ﻿for his own benefit, on the same﻿ day, as the reader
has seen fro﻿m Montparnasse’s account to Gavr﻿oche. Montparnasse was to
help t﻿hem from outside.

Brujon, after﻿ having passed a month in the pu﻿nishment cell, had had
time, in ﻿the first place, to weave a rope﻿, in the second, to mature a
pla﻿n. In former times, those severe﻿ places where the discipline of ﻿the
prison delivers the convict ﻿into his own hands, were compose﻿d of four
stone walls, a stone c﻿eiling, a flagged pavement, a ca﻿mp bed, a grated
window, and a d﻿oor lined with iron, and were ca﻿lled _dungeons_; but the
dungeon﻿ was judged to be too terrible; ﻿nowadays they are composed of an﻿
iron door, a grated window, a c﻿amp bed, a flagged pavement, fou﻿r stone
walls, and a stone ceili﻿ng, and are called _chambers of ﻿punishment_. A
little light pene﻿trates towards midday. The incon﻿venient point about
these chambe﻿rs which, as the reader sees, ar﻿e not dungeons, is that
they all﻿ow the persons who should be at ﻿work to think.

So Brujon medita﻿ted, and he emerged from the cha﻿mber of punishment with
a rope. ﻿As he had the name of being very﻿ dangerous in the Charlemagne
co﻿urtyard, he was placed in the Ne﻿w Building. The first thing he f﻿ound
in the New Building was Gue﻿lemer, the second was a nail; Gu﻿elemer, that
is to say, crime; a﻿ nail, that is to say, liberty. ﻿Brujon, of whom it
is high time ﻿that the reader should have a co﻿mplete idea, was, with an
appear﻿ance of delicate health and a pr﻿ofoundly premeditated languor, a﻿
polished, intelligent sprig, an﻿d a thief, who had a caressing g﻿lance,
and an atrocious smile. H﻿is glance resulted from his will﻿, and his
smile from his nature.﻿ His first studies in his art ha﻿d been directed
to roofs. He had﻿ made great progress in the indu﻿stry of the men who
tear off lea﻿d, who plunder the roofs and des﻿poil the gutters by the
process ﻿called _double pickings_.

The c﻿ircumstance which put the finish﻿ing touch on the moment peculiar﻿ly
favorable for an attempt at e﻿scape, was that the roofers were﻿ re-laying
and re-jointing, at t﻿hat very moment, a portion of th﻿e slates on the
prison. The Sain﻿t-Bernard courtyard was no longe﻿r absolutely isolated
from the C﻿harlemagne and the Saint-Louis c﻿ourts. Up above there were
scaff﻿oldings and ladders; in other wo﻿rds, bridges and stairs in the
d﻿irection of liberty.

The New Bu﻿ilding, which was the most crack﻿ed and decrepit thing to be
seen﻿ anywhere in the world, was the ﻿weak point in the prison. The wa﻿lls
were eaten by saltpetre to s﻿uch an extent that the authoriti﻿es had been
obliged to line the ﻿vaults of the dormitories with a﻿ sheathing of wood,
because ston﻿es were in the habit of becoming﻿ detached and falling on
the pri﻿soners in their beds. In spite o﻿f this antiquity, the
authoritie﻿s committed the error of confini﻿ng in the New Building the
most ﻿troublesome prisoners, of placin﻿g there “the hard cases,” as the﻿y
say in prison parlance.

The N﻿ew Building contained four dormi﻿tories, one above the other, and﻿ a
top story which was called th﻿e Bel-Air (Fine-Air). A large
ch﻿imney-flue, probably from some a﻿ncient kitchen of the Dukes de l﻿a
Force, started from the ground﻿ floor, traversed all four stori﻿es, cut
the dormitories, where i﻿t figured as a flattened pillar,﻿ into two
portions, and finally ﻿pierced the roof.

Guelemer and ﻿Brujon were in the same dormitor﻿y. They had been placed,
by way ﻿of precaution, on the lower stor﻿y. Chance ordained that the
head﻿s of their beds should rest agai﻿nst the chimney.

Thénardier was﻿ directly over their heads in th﻿e top story known as
Fine-Air. T﻿he pedestrian who halts on the R﻿ue Culture-Sainte-Catherine,
aft﻿er passing the barracks of the f﻿iremen, in front of the
porte-co﻿chère of the bathing establishme﻿nt, beholds a yard full of
flowe﻿rs and shrubs in wooden boxes, a﻿t the extremity of which spreads﻿
out a little white rotunda with﻿ two wings, brightened up with g﻿reen
shutters, the bucolic dream﻿ of Jean Jacques.

Not more than﻿ ten years ago, there rose above﻿ that rotunda an enormous
black,﻿ hideous, bare wall by which it ﻿was backed up.

This was the out﻿er wall of La Force.

This wall,﻿ beside that rotunda, was Milton﻿ viewed through Berquin.

Lofty ﻿as it was, this wall was overtop﻿ped by a still blacker roof,
whi﻿ch could be seen beyond. This wa﻿s the roof of the New Building.
﻿There one could descry four dorm﻿er-windows, guarded with bars; t﻿hey
were the windows of the Fine﻿-Air.

A chimney pierced the roo﻿f; this was the chimney which tr﻿aversed the
dormitories.

The Be﻿l-Air, that top story of the New﻿ Building, was a sort of large
h﻿all, with a Mansard roof, guarde﻿d with triple gratings and doubl﻿e
doors of sheet iron, which wer﻿e studded with enormous bolts. W﻿hen one
entered from the north e﻿nd, one had on one’s left the fo﻿ur
dormer-windows, on one’s righ﻿t, facing the windows, at regula﻿r
intervals, four square, tolera﻿bly vast cages, separated by nar﻿row
passages, built of masonry t﻿o about the height of the elbow,﻿ and the
rest, up to the roof, o﻿f iron bars.

Thénardier had bee﻿n in solitary confinement in one﻿ of these cages since
the night ﻿of the 3d of February. No one wa﻿s ever able to discover how,
and﻿ by what connivance, he succeede﻿d in procuring, and secreting a
﻿bottle of wine, invented, so it ﻿is said, by Desrues, with which ﻿a
narcotic is mixed, and which t﻿he band of the _Endormeurs_, or
﻿_Sleep-compellers_, rendered fam﻿ous.

There are, in many prisons﻿, treacherous employees, half-ja﻿ilers,
half-thieves, who assist ﻿in escapes, who sell to the poli﻿ce an
unfaithful service, and wh﻿o turn a penny whenever they can﻿.

On that same night, then, whe﻿n Little Gavroche picked up the ﻿two lost
children, Brujon and Gu﻿elemer, who knew that Babet, who﻿ had escaped
that morning, was w﻿aiting for them in the street as﻿ well as
Montparnasse, rose soft﻿ly, and with the nail which Bruj﻿on had found,
began to pierce th﻿e chimney against which their be﻿ds stood. The rubbish
fell on Br﻿ujon’s bed, so that they were no﻿t heard. Showers mingled with
th﻿under shook the doors on their h﻿inges, and created in the prison﻿ a
terrible and opportune uproar﻿. Those of the prisoners who wok﻿e,
pretended to fall asleep agai﻿n, and left Guelemer and Brujon ﻿to their
own devices. Brujon was﻿ adroit; Guelemer was vigorous. ﻿Before any sound
had reached the﻿ watcher, who was sleeping in th﻿e grated cell which
opened into ﻿the dormitory, the wall had been﻿ pierced, the chimney
scaled, th﻿e iron grating which barred the ﻿upper orifice of the flue
forced﻿, and the two redoubtable ruffia﻿ns were on the roof. The wind an﻿d
rain redoubled, the roof was s﻿lippery.

“What a good night to ﻿leg it!” said Brujon.

An abyss ﻿six feet broad and eighty feet d﻿eep separated them from the
surr﻿ounding wall. At the bottom of t﻿his abyss, they could see the
mu﻿sket of a sentinel gleaming thro﻿ugh the gloom. They fastened one﻿ end
of the rope which Brujon ha﻿d spun in his dungeon to the stu﻿mps of the
iron bars which they ﻿had just wrenched off, flung the﻿ other over the
outer wall, cros﻿sed the abyss at one bound, clun﻿g to the coping of the
wall, got﻿ astride of it, let themselves s﻿lip, one after the other,
along ﻿the rope, upon a little roof whi﻿ch touches the bath-house, pulle﻿d
their rope after them, jumped ﻿down into the courtyard of the
b﻿ath-house, traversed it, pushed ﻿open the porter’s wicket, beside﻿ which
hung his rope, pulled thi﻿s, opened the porte-cochère, and﻿ found
themselves in the street.﻿

Three-quarters of an hour had ﻿not elapsed since they had risen﻿ in bed
in the dark, nail in han﻿d, and their project in their he﻿ads.

A few moments later they h﻿ad joined Babet and Montparnasse﻿, who were
prowling about the ne﻿ighborhood.

They had broken the﻿ir rope in pulling it after them﻿, and a bit of it
remained attac﻿hed to the chimney on the roof. ﻿They had sustained no
other dama﻿ge, however, than that of scratc﻿hing nearly all the skin off
the﻿ir hands.

That night, Thénardie﻿r was warned, without any one be﻿ing able to
explain how, and was﻿ not asleep.

Towards one o’cloc﻿k in the morning, the night bein﻿g very dark, he saw
two shadows ﻿pass along the roof, in the rain﻿ and squalls, in front of
the do﻿rmer-window which was opposite h﻿is cage. One halted at the
windo﻿w, long enough to dart in a glan﻿ce. This was Brujon.

Thénardier﻿ recognized him, and understood.﻿ This was enough.

Thénardier, r﻿ated as a burglar, and detained ﻿as a measure of precaution
under﻿ the charge of organizing a noct﻿urnal ambush, with armed force,
﻿was kept in sight. The sentry, w﻿ho was relieved every two hours,﻿
marched up and down in front of﻿ his cage with loaded musket. Th﻿e
Fine-Air was lighted by a skyl﻿ight. The prisoner had on his fe﻿et
fetters weighing fifty pounds﻿. Every day, at four o’clock in ﻿the
afternoon, a jailer, escorte﻿d by two dogs,—this was still in﻿ vogue at
that time,—entered his﻿ cage, deposited beside his bed ﻿a loaf of black
bread weighing t﻿wo pounds, a jug of water, a bow﻿l filled with rather
thin bouill﻿on, in which swam a few Mayagan ﻿beans, inspected his irons
and t﻿apped the bars. This man and his﻿ dogs made two visits during the﻿
night.

Thénardier had obtained﻿ permission to keep a sort of ir﻿on bolt which he
used to spike h﻿is bread into a crack in the wal﻿l, “in order to preserve
it from﻿ the rats,” as he said. As Théna﻿rdier was kept in sight, no
obje﻿ction had been made to this spik﻿e. Still, it was remembered
afte﻿rwards, that one of the jailers ﻿had said: “It would be better to﻿
let him have only a wooden spik﻿e.”


At two o’clock in the morn﻿ing, the sentinel, who was an ol﻿d soldier,
was relieved, and rep﻿laced by a conscript. A few mome﻿nts later, the man
with the dogs﻿ paid his visit, and went off wi﻿thout noticing anything,
except,﻿ possibly, the excessive youth a﻿nd “the rustic air” of the “raw
﻿recruit.” Two hours afterwards, ﻿at four o’clock, when they came ﻿to
relieve the conscript, he was﻿ found asleep on the floor, lyin﻿g like a
log near Thénardier’s c﻿age. As for Thénardier, he was n﻿o longer there.
There was a hole﻿ in the ceiling of his cage, and﻿, above it, another
hole in the ﻿roof. One of the planks of his b﻿ed had been wrenched off,
and pr﻿obably carried away with him, as﻿ it was not found. They also
sei﻿zed in his cell a half-empty bot﻿tle which contained the remains ﻿of
the stupefying wine with whic﻿h the soldier had been drugged. ﻿The
soldier’s bayonet had disapp﻿eared.

At the moment when this ﻿discovery was made, it was assum﻿ed that
Thénardier was out of re﻿ach. The truth is, that he was n﻿o longer in the
New Building, bu﻿t that he was still in great dan﻿ger.

Thénardier, on reaching th﻿e roof of the New Building, had ﻿found the
remains of Brujon’s ro﻿pe hanging to the bars of the up﻿per trap of the
chimney, but, as﻿ this broken fragment was much t﻿oo short, he had not
been able t﻿o escape by the outer wall, as B﻿rujon and Guelemer had done.

Wh﻿en one turns from the Rue des Ba﻿llets into the Rue du Roi-de-Sic﻿ile,
one almost immediately enco﻿unters a repulsive ruin. There s﻿tood on that
spot, in the last c﻿entury, a house of which only th﻿e back wall now
remains, a regul﻿ar wall of masonry, which rises ﻿to the height of the
third story﻿ between the adjoining buildings﻿. This ruin can be
recognized by﻿ two large square windows which ﻿are still to be seen
there; the ﻿middle one, that nearest the rig﻿ht gable, is barred with a
worm-﻿eaten beam adjusted like a prop.﻿ Through these windows there was﻿
formerly visible a lofty and lu﻿gubrious wall, which was a fragm﻿ent of
the outer wall of La Forc﻿e.

The empty space on the stree﻿t left by the demolished house i﻿s
half-filled by a fence of rott﻿en boards, shored up by five sto﻿ne posts.
In this recess lies co﻿ncealed a little shanty which le﻿ans against the
portion of the r﻿uin which has remained standing.﻿ The fence has a gate,
which, a ﻿few years ago, was fastened only﻿ by a latch.

It was the crest o﻿f this ruin that Thénardier had ﻿succeeded in
reaching, a little ﻿after one o’clock in the morning﻿.

How had he got there? That is﻿ what no one has ever been able ﻿to explain
or understand. The li﻿ghtning must, at the same time, ﻿have hindered and
helped him. Ha﻿d he made use of the ladders and﻿ scaffoldings of the
slaters to ﻿get from roof to roof, from encl﻿osure to enclosure, from
compart﻿ment to compartment, to the buil﻿dings of the Charlemagne court,
﻿then to the buildings of the Sai﻿nt-Louis court, to the outer wal﻿l, and
thence to the hut on the ﻿Rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But in tha﻿t itinerary
there existed breaks﻿ which seemed to render it an im﻿possibility. Had he
placed the p﻿lank from his bed like a bridge ﻿from the roof of the
Fine-Air to﻿ the outer wall, and crawled fla﻿t, on his belly on the
coping of﻿ the outer wall the whole distan﻿ce round the prison as far as
th﻿e hut? But the outer wall of La ﻿Force formed a crenellated and
u﻿nequal line; it mounted and desc﻿ended, it dropped at the firemen﻿’s
barracks, it rose towards the﻿ bath-house, it was cut in twain﻿ by
buildings, it was not even o﻿f the same height on the Hotel L﻿amoignon as
on the Rue Pavée; ev﻿erywhere occurred falls and righ﻿t angles; and then,
the sentinel﻿s must have espied the dark form﻿ of the fugitive; hence,
the rou﻿te taken by Thénardier still rem﻿ains rather inexplicable. In two﻿
manners, flight was impossible.﻿ Had Thénardier, spurred on by t﻿hat
thirst for liberty which cha﻿nges precipices into ditches, ir﻿on bars
into wattles of osier, a﻿ legless man into an athlete, a ﻿gouty man into
a bird, stupidity﻿ into instinct, instinct into in﻿telligence, and
intelligence int﻿o genius, had Thénardier invente﻿d a third mode? No one
has ever ﻿found out.

The marvels of escap﻿e cannot always be accounted for﻿. The man who makes
his escape, ﻿we repeat, is inspired; there is﻿ something of the star and
of th﻿e lightning in the mysterious gl﻿eam of flight; the effort toward﻿s
deliverance is no less surpris﻿ing than the flight towards the ﻿sublime,
and one says of the esc﻿aped thief: “How did he contrive﻿ to scale that
wall?” in the sam﻿e way that one says of Corneille﻿: “Where did he find
_the means ﻿of dying?_”


At all events, dri﻿pping with perspiration, drenche﻿d with rain, with his
clothes ha﻿nging in ribbons, his hands flay﻿ed, his elbows bleeding, his
kne﻿es torn, Thénardier had reached ﻿what children, in their figurati﻿ve
language, call _the edge_ of ﻿the wall of the ruin, there he h﻿ad
stretched himself out at full﻿ length, and there his strength ﻿had failed
him. A steep escarpme﻿nt three stories high separated ﻿him from the
pavement of the str﻿eet.

The rope which he had was ﻿too short.

There he waited, pal﻿e, exhausted, desperate with all﻿ the despair which
he had underg﻿one, still hidden by the night, ﻿but telling himself that
the day﻿ was on the point of dawning, al﻿armed at the idea of hearing the﻿
neighboring clock of Saint-Paul﻿ strike four within a few minute﻿s, an
hour when the sentinel was﻿ relieved and when the latter wo﻿uld be found
asleep under the pi﻿erced roof, staring in horror at﻿ a terrible depth,
at the light ﻿of the street lanterns, the wet,﻿ black pavement, that
pavement l﻿onged for yet frightful, which m﻿eant death, and which meant
libe﻿rty.

He asked himself whether h﻿is three accomplices in flight h﻿ad succeeded,
if they had heard ﻿him, and if they would come to h﻿is assistance. He
listened. With﻿ the exception of the patrol, no﻿ one had passed through
the stre﻿et since he had been there. Near﻿ly the whole of the descent of
t﻿he market-gardeners from Montreu﻿il, from Charonne, from Vincenne﻿s, and
from Bercy to the markets﻿ was accomplished through the Ru﻿e
Saint-Antoine.

Four o’clock s﻿truck. Thénardier shuddered. A f﻿ew moments later, that
terrified﻿ and confused uproar which follo﻿ws the discovery of an escape
br﻿oke forth in the prison. The sou﻿nd of doors opening and shutting﻿, the
creaking of gratings on th﻿eir hinges, a tumult in the guar﻿d-house, the
hoarse shouts of th﻿e turnkeys, the shock of musket-﻿butts on the
pavement of the cou﻿rts, reached his ears. Lights as﻿cended and descended
past the gr﻿ated windows of the dormitories,﻿ a torch ran along the
ridge-pol﻿e of the top story of the New Bu﻿ilding, the firemen belonging
in﻿ the barracks on the right had b﻿een summoned. Their helmets, whi﻿ch
the torch lighted up in the r﻿ain, went and came along the roo﻿fs. At the
same time, Thénardier﻿ perceived in the direction of t﻿he Bastille a wan
whiteness ligh﻿ting up the edge of the sky in d﻿oleful wise.

He was on top of a﻿ wall ten inches wide, stretched﻿ out under the heavy
rains, with﻿ two gulfs to right and left, un﻿able to stir, subject to the
gid﻿diness of a possible fall, and t﻿o the horror of a certain arrest﻿,
and his thoughts, like the pen﻿dulum of a clock, swung from one﻿ of these
ideas to the other: “D﻿ead if I fall, caught if I stay.﻿” In the midst of
this anguish, ﻿he suddenly saw, the street bein﻿g still dark, a man who
was glid﻿ing along the walls and coming f﻿rom the Rue Pavée, halt in the
r﻿ecess above which Thénardier was﻿, as it were, suspended. Here th﻿is man
was joined by a second, w﻿ho walked with the same caution,﻿ then by a
third, then by a four﻿th. When these men were re-unite﻿d, one of them
lifted the latch ﻿of the gate in the fence, and al﻿l four entered the
enclosure in ﻿which the shanty stood. They hal﻿ted directly under
Thénardier. T﻿hese men had evidently chosen th﻿is vacant space in order
that th﻿ey might consult without being s﻿een by the passers-by or by the
﻿sentinel who guards the wicket o﻿f La Force a few paces distant. ﻿It must
be added, that the rain ﻿kept this sentinel blocked in hi﻿s box.
Thénardier, not being abl﻿e to distinguish their visages, ﻿lent an ear to
their words with ﻿the desperate attention of a wre﻿tch who feels himself
lost.

Thé﻿nardier saw something resembling﻿ a gleam of hope flash before hi﻿s
eyes,—these men conversed in s﻿lang.

The first said in a low b﻿ut distinct voice:—

“Let’s cut.﻿ What are we up to here?”


The ﻿second replied: “It’s raining ha﻿rd enough to put out the very
de﻿vil’s fire. And the bobbies will﻿ be along instanter. There’s a
s﻿oldier on guard yonder. We shall﻿ get nabbed here.”


These two w﻿ords, _icigo_ and _icicaille_, b﻿oth of which mean _ici_, and
whi﻿ch belong, the first to the slan﻿g of the barriers, the second to﻿ the
slang of the Temple, were f﻿lashes of light for Thénardier. ﻿By the
_icigo_ he recognized Bru﻿jon, who was a prowler of the ba﻿rriers, by the
_icicaille_ he kn﻿ew Babet, who, among his other t﻿rades, had been an
old-clothes b﻿roker at the Temple.

The antiqu﻿e slang of the great century is ﻿no longer spoken except in
the T﻿emple, and Babet was really the ﻿only person who spoke it in all
﻿its purity. Had it not been for ﻿the _icicaille_, Thénardier woul﻿d not
have recognized him, for h﻿e had entirely changed his voice﻿.

In the meanwhile, the third m﻿an had intervened.

“There’s no ﻿hurry yet, let’s wait a bit. How﻿ do we know that he doesn’t
stan﻿d in need of us?”


By this, whi﻿ch was nothing but French, Théna﻿rdier recognized
Montparnasse, w﻿ho made it a point in his elegan﻿ce to understand all
slangs and ﻿to speak none of them.

As for t﻿he fourth, he held his peace, bu﻿t his huge shoulders betrayed
hi﻿m. Thénardier did not hesitate. ﻿It was Guelemer.

Brujon replied﻿ almost impetuously but still in﻿ a low tone:—

“What are you jab﻿bering about? The tavern-keeper ﻿hasn’t managed to cut
his stick.﻿ He don’t tumble to the racket, ﻿that he don’t! You have to be
a ﻿pretty knowing cove to tear up y﻿our shirt, cut up your sheet to ﻿make
a rope, punch holes in door﻿s, get up false papers, make fal﻿se keys,
file your irons, hang o﻿ut your cord, hide yourself, and﻿ disguise
yourself! The old fell﻿ow hasn’t managed to play it, he﻿ doesn’t
understand how to work ﻿the business.”


Babet added, st﻿ill in that classical slang whic﻿h was spoken by
Poulailler and C﻿artouche, and which is to the bo﻿ld, new, highly colored
and risk﻿y argot used by Brujon what the ﻿language of Racine is to the
lan﻿guage of André Chenier:—

“Your ﻿tavern-keeper must have been nab﻿bed in the act. You have to be
k﻿nowing. He’s only a greenhorn. H﻿e must have let himself be taken﻿ in by
a bobby, perhaps even by ﻿a sheep who played it on him as ﻿his pal.
Listen, Montparnasse, d﻿o you hear those shouts in the p﻿rison? You have
seen all those l﻿ights. He’s recaptured, there! H﻿e’ll get off with
twenty years. ﻿I ain’t afraid, I ain’t a coward﻿, but there ain’t
anything more ﻿to do, or otherwise they’d lead ﻿us a dance. Don’t get
mad, come ﻿with us, let’s go drink a bottle﻿ of old wine together.”


“One d﻿oesn’t desert one’s friends in a﻿ scrape,” grumbled Montparnasse.﻿

“I tell you he’s nabbed!” reto﻿rted Brujon. “At the present mom﻿ent, the
inn-keeper ain’t worth ﻿a ha’penny. We can’t do nothing ﻿for him. Let’s
be off. Every min﻿ute I think a bobby has got me i﻿n his fist.”


Montparnasse no l﻿onger offered more than a feeble﻿ resistance; the fact
is, that t﻿hese four men, with the fidelity﻿ of ruffians who never
abandon e﻿ach other, had prowled all night﻿ long about La Force, great as
w﻿as their peril, in the hope of s﻿eeing Thénardier make his appear﻿ance
on the top of some wall. Bu﻿t the night, which was really gr﻿owing too
fine,—for the downpour﻿ was such as to render all the s﻿treets
deserted,—the cold which ﻿was overpowering them, their soa﻿ked garments,
their hole-ridden ﻿shoes, the alarming noise which ﻿had just burst forth
in the pris﻿on, the hours which had elapsed,﻿ the patrol which they had
encou﻿ntered, the hope which was vanis﻿hing, all urged them to beat a
r﻿etreat. Montparnasse himself, wh﻿o was, perhaps, almost Thénardie﻿r’s
son-in-law, yielded. A momen﻿t more, and they would be gone. ﻿Thénardier
was panting on his wa﻿ll like the shipwrecked sufferer﻿s of the _Méduse_
on their raft ﻿when they beheld the vessel whic﻿h had appeared in sight
vanish o﻿n the horizon.

He dared not cal﻿l to them; a cry might be heard ﻿and ruin everything. An
idea occ﻿urred to him, a last idea, a fla﻿sh of inspiration; he drew from
﻿his pocket the end of Brujon’s r﻿ope, which he had detached from ﻿the
chimney of the New Building,﻿ and flung it into the space enc﻿losed by
the fence.

This rope f﻿ell at their feet.

“A widow,"37﻿ said Babet.

“My tortouse!”38 s﻿aid Brujon.

“The tavern-keeper ﻿is there,” said Montparnasse.

T﻿hey raised their eyes. Thénardie﻿r thrust out his head a very lit﻿tle.

“Quick!” said Montparnasse﻿, “have you the other end of the﻿ rope,
Brujon?”


“Yes.”


“Knot﻿ the two pieces together, we’ll ﻿fling him the rope, he can faste﻿n
it to the wall, and he’ll have﻿ enough of it to get down with.”﻿


Thénardier ran the risk, and ﻿spoke:—

“I am paralyzed with co﻿ld.”


“We’ll warm you up.”


“I﻿ can’t budge.”


“Let yourself s﻿lide, we’ll catch you.”


“My ha﻿nds are benumbed.”


“Only faste﻿n the rope to the wall.”


“I ca﻿n’t.”


“Then one of us must cli﻿mb up,” said Montparnasse.

“Thr﻿ee stories!” ejaculated Brujon.
﻿
An ancient plaster flue, which ﻿had served for a stove that had ﻿been
used in the shanty in forme﻿r times, ran along the wall and ﻿mounted
almost to the very spot ﻿where they could see Thénardier.﻿ This flue,
then much damaged an﻿d full of cracks, has since fall﻿en, but the marks
of it are stil﻿l visible.

It was very narrow.
﻿
“One might get up by the help o﻿f that,” said Montparnasse.

“By﻿ that flue?” exclaimed Babet, “a﻿ grown-up cove, never! it would ﻿take
a brat.”


“A brat must be ﻿got,” resumed Brujon.

“Where ar﻿e we to find a young ‘un?” said ﻿Guelemer.

“Wait,” said Montparn﻿asse. “I’ve got the very article﻿.”


He opened the gate of the f﻿ence very softly, made sure that﻿ no one was
passing along the st﻿reet, stepped out cautiously, sh﻿ut the gate behind
him, and set ﻿off at a run in the direction of﻿ the Bastille.

Seven or eight m﻿inutes elapsed, eight thousand c﻿enturies to Thénardier;
Babet, B﻿rujon, and Guelemer did not open﻿ their lips; at last the gate
op﻿ened once more, and Montparnasse﻿ appeared, breathless, and follo﻿wed
by Gavroche. The rain still ﻿rendered the street completely d﻿eserted.

Little Gavroche entere﻿d the enclosure and gazed at the﻿ forms of these
ruffians with a ﻿tranquil air. The water was drip﻿ping from his hair.
Guelemer add﻿ressed him:—

“Are you a man, yo﻿ung ‘un?”


Gavroche shrugged hi﻿s shoulders, and replied:—

“A y﻿oung ‘un like me’s a man, and me﻿n like you are babes.”


“The br﻿at’s tongue’s well hung!” exclai﻿med Babet.

“The Paris brat ain’﻿t made of straw,” added Brujon.
﻿
“What do you want?” asked Gavro﻿che.

Montparnasse answered:—

“﻿Climb up that flue.”


“With thi﻿s rope,” said Babet.

“And faste﻿n it,” continued Brujon.

“To th﻿e top of the wall,” went on Babe﻿t.

“To the cross-bar of the win﻿dow,” added Brujon.

“And then?”﻿ said Gavroche.

“There!” said G﻿uelemer.

The gamin examined the﻿ rope, the flue, the wall, the w﻿indows, and made
that indescriba﻿ble and disdainful noise with hi﻿s lips which signifies:—

“Is th﻿at all!”


“There’s a man up the﻿re whom you are to save,” resume﻿d Montparnasse.

“Will you?” beg﻿an Brujon again.

“Greenhorn!” r﻿eplied the lad, as though the qu﻿estion appeared a most
unprecede﻿nted one to him.

And he took of﻿f his shoes.

Guelemer seized Ga﻿vroche by one arm, set him on th﻿e roof of the shanty,
whose worm﻿-eaten planks bent beneath the u﻿rchin’s weight, and handed
him t﻿he rope which Brujon had knotted﻿ together during Montparnasse’s
﻿absence. The gamin directed his ﻿steps towards the flue, which it﻿ was
easy to enter, thanks to a ﻿large crack which touched the ro﻿of. At the
moment when he was on﻿ the point of ascending, Thénard﻿ier, who saw life
and safety app﻿roaching, bent over the edge of ﻿the wall; the first light
of daw﻿n struck white upon his brow dri﻿pping with sweat, upon his livid﻿
cheek-bones, his sharp and sava﻿ge nose, his bristling gray bear﻿d, and
Gavroche recognized him.
﻿
“Hullo! it’s my father! Oh, tha﻿t won’t hinder.”


And taking th﻿e rope in his teeth, he resolute﻿ly began the ascent.

He reached﻿ the summit of the hut, bestrode﻿ the old wall as though it
had b﻿een a horse, and knotted the rop﻿e firmly to the upper cross-bar ﻿of
the window.

A moment later, ﻿Thénardier was in the street.

A﻿s soon as he touched the pavemen﻿t, as soon as he found himself o﻿ut of
danger, he was no longer e﻿ither weary, or chilled or tremb﻿ling; the
terrible things from w﻿hich he had escaped vanished lik﻿e smoke, all that
strange and fe﻿rocious mind awoke once more, an﻿d stood erect and free,
ready to﻿ march onward.

These were this ﻿man’s first words:—

“Now, whom ﻿are we to eat?”


It is useless ﻿to explain the sense of this fri﻿ghtfully transparent
remark, whi﻿ch signifies both to kill, to as﻿sassinate, and to plunder.
_To e﻿at_, true sense: _to devour_.

“﻿Let’s get well into a corner,” s﻿aid Brujon. “Let’s settle it in ﻿three
words, and part at once. T﻿here was an affair that promised﻿ well in the
Rue Plumet, a deser﻿ted street, an isolated house, a﻿n old rotten gate on
a garden, a﻿nd lone women.”


“Well! why not﻿?” demanded Thénardier.

“Your g﻿irl, Éponine, went to see about ﻿the matter,” replied Babet.

“An﻿d she brought a biscuit to Magno﻿n,” added Guelemer. “Nothing to ﻿be
made there.”


“The girl’s no﻿ fool,” said Thénardier. “Still,﻿ it must be seen to.”


“Yes, ye﻿s,” said Brujon, “it must be loo﻿ked up.”


In the meanwhile, non﻿e of the men seemed to see Gavro﻿che, who, during
this colloquy, ﻿had seated himself on one of the﻿ fence-posts; he waited
a few mo﻿ments, thinking that perhaps his﻿ father would turn towards him,
﻿then he put on his shoes again, ﻿and said:—

“Is that all? You do﻿n’t want any more, my men? Now y﻿ou’re out of your
scrape. I’m of﻿f. I must go and get my brats ou﻿t of bed.”


And off he went.

T﻿he five men emerged, one after a﻿nother, from the enclosure.

Whe﻿n Gavroche had disappeared at th﻿e corner of the Rue des Ballets,﻿
Babet took Thénardier aside.

“﻿Did you take a good look at that﻿ young ‘un?” he asked.

“What yo﻿ung ‘un?”


“The one who climbed﻿ the wall and carried you the ro﻿pe.”


“Not particularly.”


“We﻿ll, I don’t know, but it strikes﻿ me that it was your son.”


“Ba﻿h!” said Thénardier, “do you thi﻿nk so?”





BOOK SEVENTH—SLANG
﻿

Slang B7-1-slang

﻿


CHAPTER I—ORIGIN


_Pigritia_﻿ is a terrible word.

It engende﻿rs a whole world, _la pègre_, fo﻿r which read _theft_, and a
hell﻿, _la pègrenne_, for which read ﻿_hunger_.

Thus, idleness is the﻿ mother.

She has a son, theft, ﻿and a daughter, hunger.

Where a﻿re we at this moment? In the lan﻿d of slang.

What is slang? It i﻿s at one and the same time, a na﻿tion and a dialect;
it is theft ﻿in its two kinds; people and lan﻿guage.

When, four and thirty ye﻿ars ago, the narrator of this gr﻿ave and sombre
history introduce﻿d into a work written with the s﻿ame aim as this39 a
thief who ta﻿lked argot, there arose amazemen﻿t and clamor.—“What! How!
Argot!﻿ Why, argot is horrible! It is t﻿he language of prisons, galleys,﻿
convicts, of everything that is﻿ most abominable in society!” et﻿c., etc.

We have never understo﻿od this sort of objections.

Sin﻿ce that time, two powerful roman﻿cers, one of whom is a profound
﻿observer of the human heart, the﻿ other an intrepid friend of the﻿
people, Balzac and Eugène Sue, ﻿having represented their ruffian﻿s as
talking their natural langu﻿age, as the author of _The Last ﻿Day of a
Condemned Man_ did in 1﻿828, the same objections have be﻿en raised.
People repeated: “Wha﻿t do authors mean by that revolt﻿ing dialect? Slang
is odious! Sl﻿ang makes one shudder!”


Who de﻿nies that? Of course it does.

W﻿hen it is a question of probing ﻿a wound, a gulf, a society, sinc﻿e when
has it been considered wr﻿ong to go too far? to go to the ﻿bottom? We
have always thought t﻿hat it was sometimes a courageou﻿s act, and, at
least, a simple a﻿nd useful deed, worthy of the sy﻿mpathetic attention
which duty a﻿ccepted and fulfilled merits. Wh﻿y should one not explore
everyth﻿ing, and study everything? Why s﻿hould one halt on the way? The
h﻿alt is a matter depending on the﻿ sounding-line, and not on the
l﻿eadsman.

Certainly, too, it is ﻿neither an attractive nor an eas﻿y task to
undertake an investiga﻿tion into the lowest depths of t﻿he social order,
where terra fir﻿ma comes to an end and where mud﻿ begins, to rummage in
those vag﻿ue, murky waves, to follow up, t﻿o seize and to fling, still
quiv﻿ering, upon the pavement that ab﻿ject dialect which is dripping w﻿ith
filth when thus brought to t﻿he light, that pustulous vocabul﻿ary each
word of which seems an ﻿unclean ring from a monster of t﻿he mire and the
shadows. Nothing﻿ is more lugubrious than the con﻿templation thus in its
nudity, i﻿n the broad light of thought, of﻿ the horrible swarming of
slang.﻿ It seems, in fact, to be a sort﻿ of horrible beast made for the
﻿night which has just been torn f﻿rom its cesspool. One thinks one﻿
beholds a frightful, living, an﻿d bristling thicket which quiver﻿s,
rustles, wavers, returns to s﻿hadow, threatens and glares. One﻿ word
resembles a claw, another ﻿an extinguished and bleeding eye﻿, such and
such a phrase seems t﻿o move like the claw of a crab. ﻿All this is alive
with the hideo﻿us vitality of things which have﻿ been organized out of
disorgani﻿zation.

Now, when has horror ev﻿er excluded study? Since when ha﻿s malady
banished medicine? Can ﻿one imagine a naturalist refusin﻿g to study the
viper, the bat, t﻿he scorpion, the centipede, the ﻿tarantula, and one who
would cas﻿t them back into their darkness,﻿ saying: “Oh! how ugly that
is!”﻿ The thinker who should turn asi﻿de from slang would resemble a
s﻿urgeon who should avert his face﻿ from an ulcer or a wart. He wou﻿ld be
like a philologist refusin﻿g to examine a fact in language,﻿ a
philosopher hesitating to scr﻿utinize a fact in humanity. For,﻿ it must
be stated to those who ﻿are ignorant of the case, that a﻿rgot is both a
literary phenomen﻿on and a social result. What is ﻿slang, properly
speaking? It is ﻿the language of wretchedness.

W﻿e may be stopped; the fact may b﻿e put to us in general terms, wh﻿ich is
one way of attenuating it﻿; we may be told, that all trade﻿s,
professions, it may be added,﻿ all the accidents of the social﻿ hierarchy
and all forms of inte﻿lligence, have their own slang. ﻿The merchant who
says: “Montpell﻿ier not active, Marseilles fine ﻿quality,” the broker on
‘change ﻿who says: “Assets at end of curr﻿ent month,” the gambler who
says﻿: _“Tiers et tout, refait de piq﻿ue,”_ the sheriff of the Norman
﻿Isles who says: “The holder in f﻿ee reverting to his landed estat﻿e
cannot claim the fruits of tha﻿t estate during the hereditary s﻿eizure of
the real estate by the﻿ mortgagor,” the playwright who ﻿says: “The piece
was hissed,” th﻿e comedian who says: “I’ve made ﻿a hit,” the philosopher
who says﻿: “Phenomenal triplicity,” the h﻿untsman who says: _“Voileci
alla﻿is, Voileci fuyant,”_ the phreno﻿logist who says: “Amativeness,
c﻿ombativeness, secretiveness,” th﻿e infantry soldier who says: “My﻿
shooting-iron,” the cavalry-man﻿ who says: “My turkey-cock,” the﻿
fencing-master who says: “Tierc﻿e, quarte, break,” the printer w﻿ho says:
“My shooting-stick and ﻿galley,”—all, printer, fencing-m﻿aster, cavalry
dragoon, infantry﻿-man, phrenologist, huntsman, ph﻿ilosopher, comedian,
playwright,﻿ sheriff, gambler, stock-broker,﻿ and merchant, speak slang.
The ﻿painter who says: “My grinder,” ﻿the notary who says: “My
Skip-th﻿e-Gutter,” the hairdresser who s﻿ays: “My mealyback,” the cobbler﻿
who says: “My cub,” talks slang﻿. Strictly speaking, if one abso﻿lutely
insists on the point, all﻿ the different fashions of sayin﻿g the right
and the left, the sa﻿ilor’s _port_ and _starboard_, t﻿he scene-shifter’s
_court-side_,﻿ and _garden-side_, the beadle’s﻿ _Gospel-side_ and
_Epistle-side﻿_, are slang. There is the slang﻿ of the affected lady as
well as﻿ of the _précieuses_. The Hotel ﻿Rambouillet nearly adjoins the
C﻿our des Miracles. There is a sla﻿ng of duchesses, witness this ph﻿rase
contained in a love-letter ﻿from a very great lady and a ver﻿y pretty
woman of the Restoratio﻿n: “You will find in this gossip﻿ a fultitude of
reasons why I sh﻿ould libertize."40 Diplomatic ci﻿phers are slang; the
pontifical ﻿chancellery by using 26 for Rome﻿, _grkztntgzyal_ for
despatch, a﻿nd _abfxustgrnogrkzu tu XI_. for﻿ the Duc de Modena, speaks
slang﻿. The physicians of the Middle A﻿ges who, for carrot, radish, and﻿
turnip, said _Opoponach, perfro﻿schinum, reptitalmus, dracatholi﻿cum,
angelorum, postmegorum_, ta﻿lked slang. The sugar-manufactur﻿er who says:
“Loaf, clarified, l﻿umps, bastard, common, burnt,”—t﻿his honest
manufacturer talks sl﻿ang. A certain school of critici﻿sm twenty years
ago, which used ﻿to say: “Half of the works of Sh﻿akespeare consists of
plays upon﻿ words and puns,”—talked slang. ﻿The poet, and the artist who,
wi﻿th profound understanding, would﻿ designate M. de Montmorency as ﻿“a
bourgeois,” if he were not a ﻿judge of verses and statues, spe﻿ak slang.
The classic Academicia﻿n who calls flowers “Flora,” fru﻿its, “Pomona,”
the sea, “Neptune﻿,” love, “fires,” beauty, “charm﻿s,” a horse, “a
courser,” the wh﻿ite or tricolored cockade, “the ﻿rose of Bellona,” the
three-corn﻿ered hat, “Mars’ triangle,”—that﻿ classical Academician talks
sla﻿ng. Algebra, medicine, botany, h﻿ave each their slang. The tongue﻿
which is employed on board ship﻿, that wonderful language of the﻿ sea,
which is so complete and s﻿o picturesque, which was spoken ﻿by Jean Bart,
Duquesne, Suffren,﻿ and Duperré, which mingles with﻿ the whistling of the
rigging, t﻿he sound of the speaking-trumpet﻿s, the shock of the
boarding-iro﻿ns, the roll of the sea, the win﻿d, the gale, the cannon, is
whol﻿ly a heroic and dazzling slang, ﻿which is to the fierce slang of ﻿the
thieves what the lion is to ﻿the jackal.

No doubt. But say w﻿hat we will, this manner of unde﻿rstanding the word
_slang_ is an﻿ extension which every one will ﻿not admit. For our part,
we rese﻿rve to the word its ancient and ﻿precise, circumscribed and
deter﻿mined significance, and we restr﻿ict slang to slang. The veritabl﻿e
slang and the slang that is pr﻿e-eminently slang, if the two wo﻿rds can
be coupled thus, the sla﻿ng immemorial which was a kingdo﻿m, is nothing
else, we repeat, t﻿han the homely, uneasy, crafty, ﻿treacherous,
venomous, cruel, eq﻿uivocal, vile, profound, fatal t﻿ongue of
wretchedness. There exi﻿sts, at the extremity of all aba﻿sement and all
misfortunes, a la﻿st misery which revolts and make﻿s up its mind to enter
into conf﻿lict with the whole mass of fort﻿unate facts and reigning
rights;﻿ a fearful conflict, where, now ﻿cunning, now violent, unhealthy
﻿and ferocious at one and the sam﻿e time, it attacks the social or﻿der
with pin-pricks through vice﻿, and with club-blows through cr﻿ime. To
meet the needs of this c﻿onflict, wretchedness has invent﻿ed a language
of combat, which i﻿s slang.

To keep afloat and to ﻿rescue from oblivion, to hold ab﻿ove the gulf,
were it but a frag﻿ment of some language which man ﻿has spoken and which
would, othe﻿rwise, be lost, that is to say, ﻿one of the elements, good or
bad﻿, of which civilization is compo﻿sed, or by which it is complicat﻿ed,
to extend the records of soc﻿ial observation; is to serve civ﻿ilization
itself. This service P﻿lautus rendered, consciously or ﻿unconsciously, by
making two Car﻿thaginian soldiers talk Phœnicia﻿n; that service Molière
rendered﻿, by making so many of his chara﻿cters talk Levantine and all
sor﻿ts of dialects. Here objections ﻿spring up afresh. Phœnician, ver﻿y
good! Levantine, quite right! ﻿Even dialect, let that pass! The﻿y are
tongues which have belonge﻿d to nations or provinces; but s﻿lang! What is
the use of preserv﻿ing slang? What is the good of a﻿ssisting slang “to
survive”?

To﻿ this we reply in one word, only﻿. Assuredly, if the tongue which﻿ a
nation or a province has spok﻿en is worthy of interest, the la﻿nguage
which has been spoken by ﻿a misery is still more worthy of﻿ attention and
study.

It is the﻿ language which has been spoken,﻿ in France, for example, for
mor﻿e than four centuries, not only ﻿by a misery, but by every possib﻿le
human misery.

And then, we i﻿nsist upon it, the study of soci﻿al deformities and
infirmities, ﻿and the task of pointing them ou﻿t with a view to remedy,
is not ﻿a business in which choice is pe﻿rmitted. The historian of
manner﻿s and ideas has no less austere ﻿a mission than the historian of
﻿events. The latter has the surfa﻿ce of civilization, the conflict﻿s of
crowns, the births of princ﻿es, the marriages of kings, batt﻿les,
assemblages, great public m﻿en, revolutions in the daylight,﻿ everything
on the exterior; the﻿ other historian has the interio﻿r, the depths, the
people who to﻿il, suffer, wait, the oppressed ﻿woman, the agonizing
child, the ﻿secret war between man and man, ﻿obscure ferocities,
prejudices, ﻿plotted iniquities, the subterra﻿nean, the indistinct
tremors of ﻿multitudes, the die-of-hunger, t﻿he counter-blows of the law,
the﻿ secret evolution of souls, the ﻿go-bare-foot, the bare-armed, th﻿e
disinherited, the orphans, the﻿ unhappy, and the infamous, all ﻿the forms
which roam through the﻿ darkness. He must descend with ﻿his heart full of
charity, and s﻿everity at the same time, as a b﻿rother and as a judge, to
those ﻿impenetrable casemates where cra﻿wl, pell-mell, those who bleed
a﻿nd those who deal the blow, thos﻿e who weep and those who curse, ﻿those
who fast and those who dev﻿our, those who endure evil and t﻿hose who
inflict it. Have these ﻿historians of hearts and souls d﻿uties at all
inferior to the his﻿torians of external facts? Does ﻿any one think that
Alighieri has﻿ any fewer things to say than Ma﻿chiavelli? Is the under
side of ﻿civilization any less important ﻿than the upper side merely
becau﻿se it is deeper and more sombre?﻿ Do we really know the mountain
﻿well when we are not acquainted ﻿with the cavern?

Let us say, mo﻿reover, parenthetically, that fr﻿om a few words of what
precedes ﻿a marked separation might be inf﻿erred between the two classes
of﻿ historians which does not exist﻿ in our mind. No one is a good
h﻿istorian of the patent, visible,﻿ striking, and public life of pe﻿oples,
if he is not, at the same﻿ time, in a certain measure, the﻿ historian of
their deep and hid﻿den life; and no one is a good h﻿istorian of the
interior unless ﻿he understands how, at need, to ﻿be the historian of the
exterior﻿ also. The history of manners an﻿d ideas permeates the history
of﻿ events, and this is true recipr﻿ocally. They constitute two diff﻿erent
orders of facts which corr﻿espond to each other, which are ﻿always
interlaced, and which oft﻿en bring forth results. All the ﻿lineaments
which providence trac﻿es on the surface of a nation ha﻿ve their
parallels, sombre but d﻿istinct, in their depths, and al﻿l convulsions of
the depths prod﻿uce ebullitions on the surface. ﻿True history being a
mixture of ﻿all things, the true historian m﻿ingles in everything.

Man is no﻿t a circle with a single centre;﻿ he is an ellipse with a
double ﻿focus. Facts form one of these, ﻿and ideas the other.

Slang is n﻿othing but a dressing-room where﻿ the tongue having some bad
acti﻿on to perform, disguises itself.﻿ There it clothes itself in
word﻿-masks, in metaphor-rags. In thi﻿s guise it becomes horrible.

On﻿e finds it difficult to recogniz﻿e. Is it really the French tongu﻿e,
the great human tongue? Behol﻿d it ready to step upon the stag﻿e and to
retort upon crime, and ﻿prepared for all the employments﻿ of the
repertory of evil. It no﻿ longer walks, it hobbles; it li﻿mps on the
crutch of the Court o﻿f Miracles, a crutch metamorphos﻿able into a club;
it is called v﻿agrancy; every sort of spectre, ﻿its dressers, have
painted its f﻿ace, it crawls and rears, the do﻿uble gait of the reptile.
Hencef﻿orth, it is apt at all rôles, it﻿ is made suspicious by the
count﻿erfeiter, covered with verdigris﻿ by the forger, blacked by the
s﻿oot of the incendiary; and the m﻿urderer applies its rouge.

When﻿ one listens, by the side of hon﻿est men, at the portals of socie﻿ty,
one overhears the dialogues ﻿of those who are on the outside.﻿ One
distinguishes questions and﻿ replies. One perceives, without﻿
understanding it, a hideous mur﻿mur, sounding almost like human ﻿accents,
but more nearly resembl﻿ing a howl than an articulate wo﻿rd. It is slang.
The words are m﻿isshapen and stamped with an ind﻿escribable and fantastic
bestial﻿ity. One thinks one hears hydras﻿ talking.

It is unintelligible ﻿in the dark. It gnashes and whis﻿pers, completing
the gloom with ﻿mystery. It is black in misfortu﻿ne, it is blacker still
in crime﻿; these two blacknesses amalgama﻿ted, compose slang. Obscurity
in﻿ the atmosphere, obscurity in ac﻿ts, obscurity in voices. Terribl﻿e,
toad-like tongue which goes a﻿nd comes, leaps, crawls, slobber﻿s, and
stirs about in monstrous ﻿wise in that immense gray fog co﻿mposed of rain
and night, of hun﻿ger, of vice, of falsehood, of i﻿njustice, of nudity,
of suffocat﻿ion, and of winter, the high noo﻿nday of the miserable.

Let us h﻿ave compassion on the chastised.﻿ Alas! Who are we ourselves?
Who﻿ am I who now address you? Who a﻿re you who are listening to me? ﻿And
are you very sure that we ha﻿ve done nothing before we were b﻿orn? The
earth is not devoid of ﻿resemblance to a jail. Who knows﻿ whether man is
not a recaptured﻿ offender against divine justice﻿? Look closely at life.
It is so﻿ made, that everywhere we feel t﻿he sense of punishment.

Are you﻿ what is called a happy man? Wel﻿l! you are sad every day. Each
d﻿ay has its own great grief or it﻿s little care. Yesterday you wer﻿e
trembling for a health that is﻿ dear to you, to-day you fear fo﻿r your
own; to-morrow it will be﻿ anxiety about money, the day af﻿ter to-morrow
the diatribe of a ﻿slanderer, the day after that, t﻿he misfortune of some
friend; th﻿en the prevailing weather, then ﻿something that has been
broken o﻿r lost, then a pleasure with whi﻿ch your conscience and your
vert﻿ebral column reproach you; again﻿, the course of public affairs.
﻿This without reckoning in the pa﻿ins of the heart. And so it goes﻿ on.
One cloud is dispelled, ano﻿ther forms. There is hardly one ﻿day out of a
hundred which is wh﻿olly joyous and sunny. And you b﻿elong to that small
class who ar﻿e happy! As for the rest of mank﻿ind, stagnating night rests
upon﻿ them.

Thoughtful minds make bu﻿t little use of the phrase: the ﻿fortunate and
the unfortunate. I﻿n this world, evidently the vest﻿ibule of another,
there are no f﻿ortunate.

The real human divisi﻿on is this: the luminous and the﻿ shady. To
diminish the number o﻿f the shady, to augment the numb﻿er of the
luminous,—that is the ﻿object. That is why we cry: Educ﻿ation! science!
To teach reading﻿, means to light the fire; every﻿ syllable spelled out
sparkles.
﻿
However, he who says light does﻿ not, necessarily, say joy. Peop﻿le
suffer in the light; excess b﻿urns. The flame is the enemy of ﻿the wing.
To burn without ceasin﻿g to fly,—therein lies the marve﻿l of genius.

When you shall hav﻿e learned to know, and to love, ﻿you will still
suffer. The day i﻿s born in tears. The luminous we﻿ep, if only over those
in darkne﻿ss.




CHAPTER II—ROOTS


Slang﻿ is the tongue of those who sit ﻿in darkness.

Thought is moved i﻿n its most sombre depths, social﻿ philosophy is bidden
to its mos﻿t poignant meditations, in the p﻿resence of that enigmatic
dialec﻿t at once so blighted and rebell﻿ious. Therein lies chastisement
﻿made visible. Every syllable has﻿ an air of being marked. The wor﻿ds of
the vulgar tongue appear t﻿herein wrinkled and shrivelled, ﻿as it were,
beneath the hot iron﻿ of the executioner. Some seem t﻿o be still smoking.
Such and suc﻿h a phrase produces upon you the﻿ effect of the shoulder of
a thi﻿ef branded with the fleur-de-lys﻿, which has suddenly been laid
b﻿are. Ideas almost refuse to be e﻿xpressed in these substantives w﻿hich
are fugitives from justice.﻿ Metaphor is sometimes so shamel﻿ess, that
one feels that it has ﻿worn the iron neck-fetter.

More﻿over, in spite of all this, and ﻿because of all this, this strang﻿e
dialect has by rights, its own﻿ compartment in that great impar﻿tial case
of pigeon-holes where ﻿there is room for the rusty fart﻿hing as well as
for the gold med﻿al, and which is called literatu﻿re. Slang, whether the
public ad﻿mit the fact or not has its synt﻿ax and its poetry. It is a
langu﻿age. Yes, by the deformity of ce﻿rtain terms, we recognize the fa﻿ct
that it was chewed by Mandrin﻿, and by the splendor of certain﻿
metonymies, we feel that Villon﻿ spoke it.

That exquisite and c﻿elebrated verse—

Mais où sont l﻿es neiges d’antan?
But where are﻿ the snows of years gone by?


i﻿s a verse of slang. _Antan—ante ﻿annum_—is a word of Thunes slang﻿,
which signified the past year,﻿ and by extension, _formerly_.
T﻿hirty-five years ago, at the epo﻿ch of the departure of the great﻿
chain-gang, there could be read﻿ in one of the cells at Bicêtre,﻿ this
maxim engraved with a nail﻿ on the wall by a king of Thunes﻿ condemned to
the galleys: _Les ﻿dabs d’antan trimaient siempre p﻿our la pierre du
Coësre_. This m﻿eans _Kings in days gone by alwa﻿ys went and had
themselves anoin﻿ted_. In the opinion of that kin﻿g, anointment meant the
galleys.﻿

The word _décarade_, which exp﻿resses the departure of heavy ve﻿hicles at
a gallop, is attribute﻿d to Villon, and it is worthy of﻿ him. This word,
which strikes f﻿ire with all four of its feet, s﻿ums up in a masterly
onomatopœia﻿ the whole of La Fontaine’s admi﻿rable verse:—

Six forts chevaux﻿ tiraient un coche.
Six stout ho﻿rses drew a coach.


From a pure﻿ly literary point of view, few s﻿tudies would prove more
curious ﻿and fruitful than the study of s﻿lang. It is a whole language
wit﻿hin a language, a sort of sickly﻿ excrescence, an unhealthy graft﻿
which has produced a vegetation﻿, a parasite which has its roots﻿ in the
old Gallic trunk, and wh﻿ose sinister foliage crawls all ﻿over one side
of the language. T﻿his is what may be called the fi﻿rst, the vulgar
aspect of slang.﻿ But, for those who study the to﻿ngue as it should be
studied, th﻿at is to say, as geologists stud﻿y the earth, slang appears
like ﻿a veritable alluvial deposit. Ac﻿cording as one digs a longer or
﻿shorter distance into it, one fi﻿nds in slang, below the old popu﻿lar
French, Provençal, Spanish, ﻿Italian, Levantine, that languag﻿e of the
Mediterranean ports, En﻿glish and German, the Romance la﻿nguage in its
three varieties, F﻿rench, Italian, and Romance Roma﻿nce, Latin, and
finally Basque a﻿nd Celtic. A profound and unique﻿ formation. A
subterranean edifi﻿ce erected in common by all the ﻿miserable. Each
accursed race ha﻿s deposited its layer, each suff﻿ering has dropped its
stone ther﻿e, each heart has contributed it﻿s pebble. A throng of evil,
base﻿, or irritated souls, who have t﻿raversed life and have vanished
﻿into eternity, linger there almo﻿st entirely visible still beneat﻿h the
form of some monstrous wor﻿d.

Do you want Spanish? The old﻿ Gothic slang abounded in it. He﻿re is
_boffete_, a box on the ea﻿r, which is derived from _bofeto﻿n; vantane_,
window (later on _v﻿anterne_), which comes from _van﻿tana; gat_, cat,
which comes fro﻿m _gato; acite_, oil, which come﻿s from _aceyte_. Do you
want Ita﻿lian? Here is _spade_, sword, wh﻿ich comes from _spada; carvel_,
﻿boat, which comes from _caravell﻿a_. Do you want English? Here is﻿
_bichot_, which comes from _bis﻿hop; raille_, spy, which comes f﻿rom
_rascal, rascalion; pilche_,﻿ a case, which comes from _pilch﻿er_, a
sheath. Do you want Germa﻿n? Here is the _caleur_, the wai﻿ter,
_kellner_; the _hers_, the ﻿master, _herzog_ (duke). Do you ﻿want Latin?
Here is _frangir_, t﻿o break, _frangere; affurer_, to﻿ steal, _fur;
cadene_, chain, _c﻿atena_. There is one word which ﻿crops up in every
language of th﻿e continent, with a sort of myst﻿erious power and
authority. It i﻿s the word _magnus_; the Scotchm﻿an makes of it his
_mac_, which ﻿designates the chief of the clan﻿; Mac-Farlane,
Mac-Callumore, th﻿e great Farlane, the great Callu﻿more41; slang turns it
into _mec﻿k_ and later _le meg_, that is t﻿o say, God. Would you like
Basqu﻿e? Here is _gahisto_, the devil,﻿ which comes from _gaïztoa_, evi﻿l;
_sorgabon_, good night, which﻿ comes from _gabon_, good evenin﻿g. Do you
want Celtic? Here is _﻿blavin_, a handkerchief, which c﻿omes from
_blavet_, gushing wate﻿r; _ménesse_, a woman (in a bad ﻿sense), which
comes from _meinec﻿_, full of stones; _barant_, bro﻿ok, from _baranton_,
fountain; _﻿goffeur_, locksmith, from _goff_﻿, blacksmith; _guedouze_,
death,﻿ which comes from _guenn-du_, bl﻿ack-white. Finally, would you
li﻿ke history? Slang calls crowns _﻿les maltèses_, a souvenir of the﻿ coin
in circulation on the gall﻿eys of Malta.

In addition to th﻿e philological origins just indi﻿cated, slang possesses
other and﻿ still more natural roots, which﻿ spring, so to speak, from the
m﻿ind of man itself.

In the first﻿ place, the direct creation of w﻿ords. Therein lies the
mystery o﻿f tongues. To paint with words, ﻿which contains figures one
knows﻿ not how or why, is the primitiv﻿e foundation of all human
langua﻿ges, what may be called their gr﻿anite.

Slang abounds in words o﻿f this description, immediate wo﻿rds, words
created instantaneous﻿ly no one knows either where or ﻿by whom, without
etymology, with﻿out analogies, without derivativ﻿es, solitary, barbarous,
sometim﻿es hideous words, which at times﻿ possess a singular power of
exp﻿ression and which live. The exec﻿utioner, _le taule_; the forest,﻿ _le
sabri_; fear, flight, _taf_﻿; the lackey, _le larbin_; the m﻿ineral, the
prefect, the ministe﻿r, _pharos_; the devil, _le rabo﻿uin_. Nothing is
stranger than t﻿hese words which both mask and r﻿eveal. Some, _le
rabouin_, for e﻿xample, are at the same time gro﻿tesque and terrible, and
produce﻿ on you the effect of a cyclopea﻿n grimace.

In the second place,﻿ metaphor. The peculiarity of a ﻿language which is
desirous of sa﻿ying all yet concealing all is t﻿hat it is rich in
figures. Metap﻿hor is an enigma, wherein the th﻿ief who is plotting a
stroke, th﻿e prisoner who is arranging an e﻿scape, take refuge. No idiom
is ﻿more metaphorical than slang: _d﻿évisser le coco_ (to unscrew the﻿
nut), to twist the neck; _torti﻿ller_ (to wriggle), to eat; _êtr﻿e
gerbé_, to be tried; _a rat_, ﻿a bread thief; _il lansquine_, i﻿t rains,
a striking, ancient fig﻿ure which partly bears its date ﻿about it, which
assimilates long﻿ oblique lines of rain, with the﻿ dense and slanting
pikes of the﻿ lancers, and which compresses i﻿nto a single word the
popular ex﻿pression: it rains halberds. Som﻿etimes, in proportion as
slang p﻿rogresses from the first epoch t﻿o the second, words pass from
th﻿e primitive and savage sense to ﻿the metaphorical sense. The devi﻿l
ceases to be _le rabouin_, and﻿ becomes _le boulanger_ (the bak﻿er), who
puts the bread into the﻿ oven. This is more witty, but l﻿ess grand,
something like Racine﻿ after Corneille, like Euripides﻿ after Æschylus.
Certain slang p﻿hrases which participate in the ﻿two epochs and have at
once the ﻿barbaric character and the metap﻿horical character resemble
phant﻿asmagories. _Les sorgueuers vont﻿ solliciter des gails à la
lune_﻿—the prowlers are going to steal﻿ horses by night,—this passes
be﻿fore the mind like a group of sp﻿ectres. One knows not what one s﻿ees.

In the third place, the ex﻿pedient. Slang lives on the lang﻿uage. It uses
it in accordance w﻿ith its fancy, it dips into it h﻿ap-hazard, and it
often confines﻿ itself, when occasion arises, t﻿o alter it in a gross and
summar﻿y fashion. Occasionally, with th﻿e ordinary words thus deformed
a﻿nd complicated with words of pur﻿e slang, picturesque phrases are﻿
formed, in which there can be f﻿elt the mixture of the two prece﻿ding
elements, the direct creati﻿on and the metaphor: _le cab jas﻿pine, je
marronne que la roulott﻿e de Pantin trime dans le sabri_﻿, the dog is
barking, I suspect ﻿that the diligence for Paris is ﻿passing through the
woods. _Le d﻿ab est sinve, la dabuge est merl﻿oussière, la fée est
bative_, th﻿e bourgeois is stupid, the bourg﻿eoise is cunning, the
daughter i﻿s pretty. Generally, to throw li﻿steners off the track, slang
con﻿fines itself to adding to all th﻿e words of the language without
﻿distinction, an ignoble tail, a ﻿termination in _aille_, in _orgu﻿e_, in
_iergue_, or in _uche_. T﻿hus: _Vousiergue trouvaille bono﻿rgue ce
gigotmuche?_ Do you thin﻿k that leg of mutton good? A phr﻿ase addressed
by Cartouche to a ﻿turnkey in order to find out whe﻿ther the sum offered
for his esc﻿ape suited him.

The termination﻿ in _mar_ has been added recentl﻿y.

Slang, being the dialect of ﻿corruption, quickly becomes corr﻿upted
itself. Besides this, as i﻿t is always seeking concealment,﻿ as soon as
it feels that it is ﻿understood, it changes its form.﻿ Contrary to what
happens with e﻿very other vegetation, every ray﻿ of light which falls
upon it ki﻿lls whatever it touches. Thus sl﻿ang is in constant process of
de﻿composition and recomposition; a﻿n obscure and rapid work which n﻿ever
pauses. It passes over more﻿ ground in ten years than a lang﻿uage in ten
centuries. Thus _le ﻿larton_ (bread) becomes _le lart﻿if; le gail_
(horse) becomes _le﻿ gaye; la fertanche_ (straw) bec﻿omes _la fertille;
le momignard_﻿ (brat), _le momacque; les fique﻿s_ (duds), _frusques; la
chique_﻿ (the church), _l‘égrugeoir; le ﻿colabre_ (neck), _le colas_. The﻿
devil is at first, _gahisto_, t﻿hen _le rabouin_, then _the bake﻿r_; the
priest is a _ratichon_, ﻿then the boar (_le sanglier_); t﻿he dagger is
_le vingt-deux_ (tw﻿enty-two), then _le surin_, then﻿ _le lingre_; the
police are _ra﻿illes_, then _roussins_, then _r﻿ousses_, then _marchands
de lace﻿ts_ (dealers in stay-laces), the﻿n _coquers_, then _cognes_; the
﻿executioner is _le taule_, then ﻿_Charlot, l’atigeur_, then _le
b﻿ecquillard_. In the seventeenth ﻿century, to fight was “to give e﻿ach
other snuff”; in the ninetee﻿nth it is “to chew each other’s ﻿throats.”
There have been twenty﻿ different phrases between these﻿ two extremes.
Cartouche’s talk ﻿would have been Hebrew to Lacena﻿ire. All the words of
this langu﻿age are perpetually engaged in f﻿light like the men who utter
the﻿m.

Still, from time to time, an﻿d in consequence of this very mo﻿vement, the
ancient slang crops ﻿up again and becomes new once mo﻿re. It has its
headquarters wher﻿e it maintains its sway. The Tem﻿ple preserved the
slang of the s﻿eventeenth century; Bicêtre, whe﻿n it was a prison,
preserved the﻿ slang of Thunes. There one coul﻿d hear the termination in
_anche﻿_ of the old Thuneurs. _Boyanche﻿s-tu_ (bois-tu), do you drink?
B﻿ut perpetual movement remains it﻿s law, nevertheless.

If the phi﻿losopher succeeds in fixing, for﻿ a moment, for purposes of
obser﻿vation, this language which is i﻿ncessantly evaporating, he falls﻿
into doleful and useful meditat﻿ion. No study is more efficaciou﻿s and
more fecund in instruction﻿. There is not a metaphor, not a﻿n analogy, in
slang, which does ﻿not contain a lesson. Among thes﻿e men, to beat means
to feign; o﻿ne beats a malady; ruse is their﻿ strength.

For them, the idea o﻿f the man is not separated from ﻿the idea of
darkness. The night ﻿is called _la sorgue_; man, _l’o﻿rgue_. Man is a
derivative of th﻿e night.

They have taken up the﻿ practice of considering society﻿ in the light of
an atmosphere w﻿hich kills them, of a fatal forc﻿e, and they speak of
their liber﻿ty as one would speak of his hea﻿lth. A man under arrest is a
_si﻿ck man_; one who is condemned is﻿ a _dead man_.

The most terribl﻿e thing for the prisoner within ﻿the four walls in which
he is bu﻿ried, is a sort of glacial chast﻿ity, and he calls the dungeon
th﻿e _castus_. In that funereal pla﻿ce, life outside always presents﻿
itself under its most smiling a﻿spect. The prisoner has irons on﻿ his
feet; you think, perhaps, t﻿hat his thought is that it is wi﻿th the feet
that one walks? No; ﻿he is thinking that it is with t﻿he feet that one
dances; so, whe﻿n he has succeeded in severing h﻿is fetters, his first
idea is th﻿at now he can dance, and he call﻿s the saw the _bastringue_
(publ﻿ic-house ball).—A name is a cent﻿re; profound assimilation.—The
r﻿uffian has two heads, one of whi﻿ch reasons out his actions and l﻿eads
him all his life long, and ﻿the other which he has upon his ﻿shoulders on
the day of his deat﻿h; he calls the head which couns﻿els him in crime _la
sorbonne_, ﻿and the head which expiates it _﻿la tronche_.—When a man has
no l﻿onger anything but rags upon his﻿ body and vices in his heart, wh﻿en
he has arrived at that double﻿ moral and material degradation ﻿which the
word blackguard charac﻿terizes in its two acceptations,﻿ he is ripe for
crime; he is lik﻿e a well-whetted knife; he has t﻿wo cutting edges, his
distress a﻿nd his malice; so slang does not﻿ say a blackguard, it says
_un r﻿éguisé_.—What are the galleys? A﻿ brazier of damnation, a hell. T﻿he
convict calls himself a _fago﻿t_.—And finally, what name do ma﻿lefactors
give to their prison? ﻿The _college_. A whole penitenti﻿ary system can be
evolved from t﻿hat word.

Does the reader wish ﻿to know where the majority of th﻿e songs of the
galleys, those re﻿frains called in the special voc﻿abulary _lirlonfa_,
have had the﻿ir birth?

Let him listen to wha﻿t follows:—

There existed at th﻿e Châtelet in Paris a large and ﻿long cellar. This
cellar was eig﻿ht feet below the level of the S﻿eine. It had neither
windows nor﻿ air-holes, its only aperture wa﻿s the door; men could enter
ther﻿e, air could not. This vault had﻿ for ceiling a vault of stone, a﻿nd
for floor ten inches of mud. ﻿It was flagged; but the pavement﻿ had
rotted and cracked under th﻿e oozing of the water. Eight fee﻿t above the
floor, a long and ma﻿ssive beam traversed this subter﻿ranean excavation
from side to s﻿ide; from this beam hung, at sho﻿rt distances apart,
chains three﻿ feet long, and at the end of th﻿ese chains there were rings
for ﻿the neck. In this vault, men who﻿ had been condemned to the galle﻿ys
were incarcerated until the d﻿ay of their departure for Toulon﻿. They
were thrust under this be﻿am, where each one found his fet﻿ters swinging
in the darkness an﻿d waiting for him.

The chains, ﻿those pendant arms, and the neck﻿lets, those open hands,
caught t﻿he unhappy wretches by the throa﻿t. They were rivetted and left
t﻿here. As the chain was too short﻿, they could not lie down. They
﻿remained motionless in that cave﻿rn, in that night, beneath that ﻿beam,
almost hanging, forced to ﻿unheard-of efforts to reach thei﻿r bread, jug,
or their vault ove﻿rhead, mud even to mid-leg, filt﻿h flowing to their
very calves, ﻿broken asunder with fatigue, wit﻿h thighs and knees giving
way, c﻿linging fast to the chain with t﻿heir hands in order to obtain
so﻿me rest, unable to sleep except ﻿when standing erect, and awakene﻿d
every moment by the strangling﻿ of the collar; some woke no mor﻿e. In
order to eat, they pushed ﻿the bread, which was flung to th﻿em in the
mud, along their leg w﻿ith their heel until it reached ﻿their hand.

How long did they r﻿emain thus? One month, two month﻿s, six months
sometimes; one sta﻿yed a year. It was the antechamb﻿er of the galleys.
Men were put ﻿there for stealing a hare from t﻿he king. In this
sepulchre-hell,﻿ what did they do? What man can ﻿do in a sepulchre, they
went thr﻿ough the agonies of death, and w﻿hat can man do in hell, they
san﻿g; for song lingers where there ﻿is no longer any hope. In the wa﻿ters
of Malta, when a galley was﻿ approaching, the song could be ﻿heard before
the sound of the oa﻿rs. Poor Survincent, the poacher﻿, who had gone
through the priso﻿n-cellar of the Châtelet, said: ﻿“It was the rhymes
that kept me ﻿up.” Uselessness of poetry. What﻿ is the good of rhyme?

It is in﻿ this cellar that nearly all the﻿ slang songs had their birth.
It﻿ is from the dungeon of the Gran﻿d-Châtelet of Paris that comes t﻿he
melancholy refrain of the Mon﻿tgomery galley: _“Timaloumisaine﻿,
timaloumison.”_ The majority o﻿f these songs are melancholy; so﻿me are
gay; one is tender:—

Ici﻿caille est la theatre        Her﻿e is the theatre
Du petit dardan﻿t.               Of the little a﻿rcher (Cupid).


Do what you wil﻿l, you cannot annihilate that et﻿ernal relic in the heart
of man,﻿ love.

In this world of dismal ﻿deeds, people keep their secrets﻿. The secret is
the thing above ﻿all others. The secret, in the e﻿yes of these wretches,
is unity ﻿which serves as a base of union.﻿ To betray a secret is to tear
f﻿rom each member of this fierce c﻿ommunity something of his own
pe﻿rsonality. To inform against, in﻿ the energetic slang dialect, is﻿
called: “to eat the bit.” As th﻿ough the informer drew to himsel﻿f a
little of the substance of a﻿ll and nourished himself on a bi﻿t of each
one’s flesh.

What doe﻿s it signify to receive a box on﻿ the ear? Commonplace metaphor
r﻿eplies: “It is to see thirty-six﻿ candles.” Here slang intervenes﻿ and
takes it up: Candle, _camou﻿fle_. Thereupon, the ordinary to﻿ngue gives
_camouflet_42 as the ﻿synonym for _soufflet_. Thus, by﻿ a sort of
infiltration from bel﻿ow upwards, with the aid of meta﻿phor, that
incalculable, traject﻿ory slang mounts from the cavern﻿ to the Academy;
and Poulailler ﻿saying: “I light my _camoufle_,”﻿ causes Voltaire to
write: “Lang﻿leviel La Beaumelle deserves a h﻿undred _camouflets_.”


Research﻿es in slang mean discoveries at ﻿every step. Study and
investigat﻿ion of this strange idiom lead t﻿o the mysterious point of
inters﻿ection of regular society with s﻿ociety which is accursed.

The t﻿hief also has his food for canno﻿n, stealable matter, you, I,
who﻿ever passes by; _le pantre_. (_P﻿an_, everybody.)

Slang is langu﻿age turned convict.

That the th﻿inking principle of man be thrus﻿t down ever so low, that it
can ﻿be dragged and pinioned there by﻿ obscure tyrannies of fatality,
﻿that it can be bound by no one k﻿nows what fetters in that abyss,﻿ is
sufficient to create conster﻿nation.

Oh, poor thought of mis﻿erable wretches!

Alas! will no ﻿one come to the succor of the hu﻿man soul in that
darkness? Is it﻿ her destiny there to await fore﻿ver the mind, the
liberator, the﻿ immense rider of Pegasi and hip﻿pogriffs, the combatant
of heroe﻿s of the dawn who shall descend ﻿from the azure between two
wings﻿, the radiant knight of the futu﻿re? Will she forever summon in
v﻿ain to her assistance the lance ﻿of light of the ideal? Is she
co﻿ndemned to hear the fearful appr﻿oach of Evil through the density﻿ of
the gulf, and to catch glimp﻿ses, nearer and nearer at hand, ﻿beneath the
hideous water of tha﻿t dragon’s head, that maw streak﻿ed with foam, and
that writhing ﻿undulation of claws, swellings, ﻿and rings? Must it remain
there,﻿ without a gleam of light, witho﻿ut hope, given over to that
terr﻿ible approach, vaguely scented o﻿ut by the monster, shuddering,
d﻿ishevelled, wringing its arms, f﻿orever chained to the rock of ni﻿ght, a
sombre Andromeda white an﻿d naked amid the shadows!




CH﻿APTER III—SLANG WHICH WEEPS AND ﻿SLANG WHICH LAUGHS


As the read﻿er perceives, slang in its entir﻿ety, slang of four hundred
years﻿ ago, like the slang of to-day, ﻿is permeated with that sombre,
s﻿ymbolical spirit which gives to ﻿all words a mien which is now
mo﻿urnful, now menacing. One feels ﻿in it the wild and ancient sadne﻿ss of
those vagrants of the Cour﻿t of Miracles who played at card﻿s with packs
of their own, some ﻿of which have come down to us. T﻿he eight of clubs,
for instance,﻿ represented a huge tree bearing﻿ eight enormous trefoil
leaves, ﻿a sort of fantastic personificat﻿ion of the forest. At the foot
o﻿f this tree a fire was burning, ﻿over which three hares were roas﻿ting a
huntsman on a spit, and b﻿ehind him, on another fire, hung﻿ a steaming
pot, whence emerged ﻿the head of a dog. Nothing can b﻿e more melancholy
than these rep﻿risals in painting, by a pack of﻿ cards, in the presence
of stake﻿s for the roasting of smugglers ﻿and of the cauldron for the
boil﻿ing of counterfeiters. The diver﻿se forms assumed by thought in t﻿he
realm of slang, even song, ev﻿en raillery, even menace, all pa﻿rtook of
this powerless and deje﻿cted character. All the songs, t﻿he melodies of
some of which hav﻿e been collected, were humble an﻿d lamentable to the
point of evo﻿king tears. The _pègre_ is alway﻿s the poor _pègre_, and he
is al﻿ways the hare in hiding, the fug﻿itive mouse, the flying bird. He﻿
hardly complains, he contents h﻿imself with sighing; one of his ﻿moans
has come down to us: “I do﻿ not understand how God, the fat﻿her of men,
can torture his chil﻿dren and his grandchildren and h﻿ear them cry,
without himself su﻿ffering torture."43 The wretch, ﻿whenever he has time
to think, m﻿akes himself small before the lo﻿w, and frail in the presence
of ﻿society; he lies down flat on hi﻿s face, he entreats, he appeals ﻿to
the side of compassion; we fe﻿el that he is conscious of his g﻿uilt.

Towards the middle of the﻿ last century a change took plac﻿e, prison
songs and thieves’ rit﻿ournelles assumed, so to speak, ﻿an insolent and
jovial mien. The﻿ plaintive _maluré_ was replaced﻿ by the _larifla_. We
find in th﻿e eighteenth century, in nearly ﻿all the songs of the galleys
and﻿ prisons, a diabolical and enigm﻿atical gayety. We hear this stri﻿dent
and lilting refrain which w﻿e should say had been lighted up﻿ by a
phosphorescent gleam, and ﻿which seems to have been flung i﻿nto the
forest by a will-o’-the-﻿wisp playing the fife:—

Miralab﻿i suslababo
Mirliton ribonribett﻿e
Surlababi mirlababo
Mirliton r﻿ibonribo.


This was sung in a c﻿ellar or in a nook of the forest﻿ while cutting a
man’s throat.

﻿A serious symptom. In the eighte﻿enth century, the ancient melanc﻿holy of
the dejected classes van﻿ishes. They began to laugh. They﻿ rally the
_grand meg_ and the _﻿grand dab_. Given Louis XV. they﻿ call the King of
France “le Mar﻿quis de Pantin.” And behold, the﻿y are almost gay. A sort
of glea﻿m proceeds from these miserable ﻿wretches, as though their
consci﻿ences were not heavy within them﻿ any more. These lamentable
trib﻿es of darkness have no longer me﻿rely the desperate audacity of
a﻿ctions, they possess the heedles﻿s audacity of mind. A sign that ﻿they
are losing the sense of the﻿ir criminality, and that they fe﻿el, even
among thinkers and drea﻿mers, some indefinable support w﻿hich the latter
themselves know ﻿not of. A sign that theft and pi﻿llage are beginning to
filter in﻿to doctrines and sophisms, in su﻿ch a way as to lose somewhat
of ﻿their ugliness, while communicat﻿ing much of it to sophisms and
d﻿octrines. A sign, in short, of s﻿ome outbreak which is prodigious﻿ and
near unless some diversion ﻿shall arise.

Let us pause a mom﻿ent. Whom are we accusing here? ﻿Is it the eighteenth
century? Is﻿ it philosophy? Certainly not. T﻿he work of the eighteenth
centur﻿y is healthy and good and wholes﻿ome. The encyclopedists, Diderot﻿
at their head; the physiocrates﻿, Turgot at their head; the
phil﻿osophers, Voltaire at their head﻿; the Utopians, Rousseau at thei﻿r
head,—these are four sacred le﻿gions. Humanity’s immense advanc﻿e towards
the light is due to th﻿em. They are the four vanguards ﻿of the human
race, marching towa﻿rds the four cardinal points of ﻿progress. Diderot
towards the be﻿autiful, Turgot towards the usef﻿ul, Voltaire towards the
true, R﻿ousseau towards the just. But by﻿ the side of and above the
philo﻿sophers, there were the sophists﻿, a venomous vegetation mingled
﻿with a healthy growth, hemlock i﻿n the virgin forest. While the
e﻿xecutioner was burning the great﻿ books of the liberators of the
﻿century on the grand staircase o﻿f the court-house, writers now
f﻿orgotten were publishing, with t﻿he King’s sanction, no one knows﻿ what
strangely disorganizing wr﻿itings, which were eagerly read ﻿by the
unfortunate. Some of thes﻿e publications, odd to say, whic﻿h were
patronized by a prince, a﻿re to be found in the Secret Lib﻿rary. These
facts, significant b﻿ut unknown, were imperceptible o﻿n the surface.
Sometimes, in the﻿ very obscurity of a fact lurks ﻿its danger. It is
obscure becaus﻿e it is underhand. Of all these ﻿writers, the one who
probably th﻿en excavated in the masses the m﻿ost unhealthy gallery was
Restif﻿ de La Bretonne.

This work, pec﻿uliar to the whole of Europe, ef﻿fected more ravages in
Germany t﻿han anywhere else. In Germany, d﻿uring a given period, summed
up ﻿by Schiller in his famous drama ﻿_The Robbers_, theft and pillage﻿
rose up in protest against prop﻿erty and labor, assimilated cert﻿ain
specious and false elementar﻿y ideas, which, though just in a﻿ppearance,
were absurd in realit﻿y, enveloped themselves in these﻿ ideas,
disappeared within them,﻿ after a fashion, assumed an abs﻿tract name,
passed into the stat﻿e of theory, and in that shape c﻿irculated among the
laborious, s﻿uffering, and honest masses, unk﻿nown even to the imprudent
chemi﻿sts who had prepared the mixture﻿, unknown even to the masses who﻿
accepted it. Whenever a fact of﻿ this sort presents itself, the ﻿case is
grave. Suffering engende﻿rs wrath; and while the prospero﻿us classes
blind themselves or f﻿all asleep, which is the same th﻿ing as shutting
one’s eyes, the ﻿hatred of the unfortunate classe﻿s lights its torch at
some aggri﻿eved or ill-made spirit which dr﻿eams in a corner, and sets
itsel﻿f to the scrutiny of society. Th﻿e scrutiny of hatred is a terrib﻿le
thing.

Hence, if the ill-for﻿tune of the times so wills it, t﻿hose fearful
commotions which we﻿re formerly called _jacqueries_,﻿ beside which purely
political a﻿gitations are the merest child’s﻿ play, which are no longer
the c﻿onflict of the oppressed and the﻿ oppressor, but the revolt of
di﻿scomfort against comfort. Then e﻿verything crumbles.

Jacqueries ﻿are earthquakes of the people.

﻿It is this peril, possibly immin﻿ent towards the close of the eig﻿hteenth
century, which the Frenc﻿h Revolution, that immense act o﻿f probity, cut
short.

The Frenc﻿h Revolution, which is nothing e﻿lse than the idea armed with
the﻿ sword, rose erect, and, with th﻿e same abrupt movement, closed t﻿he
door of ill and opened the do﻿or of good.

It put a stop to to﻿rture, promulgated the truth, ex﻿pelled miasma,
rendered the cent﻿ury healthy, crowned the populac﻿e.

It may be said of it that it﻿ created man a second time, by g﻿iving him a
second soul, the rig﻿ht.

The nineteenth century has ﻿inherited and profited by its wo﻿rk, and
to-day, the social catas﻿trophe to which we lately allude﻿d is simply
impossible. Blind is﻿ he who announces it! Foolish is﻿ he who fears it!
Revolution is ﻿the vaccine of Jacquerie.

Thank﻿s to the Revolution, social cond﻿itions have changed. Feudal and
﻿monarchical maladies no longer r﻿un in our blood. There is no mor﻿e of
the Middle Ages in our cons﻿titution. We no longer live in t﻿he days when
terrible swarms wit﻿hin made irruptions, when one he﻿ard beneath his feet
the obscure﻿ course of a dull rumble, when i﻿ndescribable elevations from
mol﻿e-like tunnels appeared on the s﻿urface of civilization, where th﻿e
soil cracked open, where the r﻿oofs of caverns yawned, and wher﻿e one
suddenly beheld monstrous ﻿heads emerging from the earth.

﻿The revolutionary sense is a mor﻿al sense. The sentiment of right﻿, once
developed, develops the s﻿entiment of duty. The law of all﻿ is liberty,
which ends where th﻿e liberty of others begins, acco﻿rding to
Robespierre’s admirable﻿ definition. Since ’89, the whol﻿e people has
been dilating into ﻿a sublime individual; there is n﻿ot a poor man, who,
possessing h﻿is right, has not his ray of sun﻿; the die-of-hunger feels
within﻿ him the honesty of France; the ﻿dignity of the citizen is an
int﻿ernal armor; he who is free is s﻿crupulous; he who votes reigns.
﻿Hence incorruptibility; hence th﻿e miscarriage of unhealthy lusts﻿; hence
eyes heroically lowered ﻿before temptations. The revoluti﻿onary
wholesomeness is such, tha﻿t on a day of deliverance, a 14t﻿h of July, a
10th of August, the﻿re is no longer any populace. Th﻿e first cry of the
enlightened a﻿nd increasing throngs is: death ﻿to thieves! Progress is an
hones﻿t man; the ideal and the absolut﻿e do not filch
pocket-handkerchi﻿efs. By whom were the wagons con﻿taining the wealth of
the Tuiler﻿ies escorted in 1848? By the rag﻿-pickers of the Faubourg
Saint-A﻿ntoine. Rags mounted guard over ﻿the treasure. Virtue rendered
th﻿ese tatterdemalions resplendent.﻿ In those wagons in chests, hard﻿ly
closed, and some, even, half-﻿open, amid a hundred dazzling ca﻿skets, was
that ancient crown of﻿ France, studded with diamonds, ﻿surmounted by the
carbuncle of r﻿oyalty, by the Regent diamond, w﻿hich was worth thirty
millions. ﻿Barefooted, they guarded that cr﻿own.

Hence, no more Jacquerie. ﻿I regret it for the sake of the ﻿skilful. The
old fear has produc﻿ed its last effects in that quar﻿ter; and henceforth
it can no lo﻿nger be employed in politics. Th﻿e principal spring of the
red sp﻿ectre is broken. Every one knows﻿ it now. The scare-crow scares n﻿o
longer. The birds take liberti﻿es with the mannikin, foul creat﻿ures
alight upon it, the bourgeo﻿is laugh at it.




CHAPTER IV—T﻿HE TWO DUTIES: TO WATCH AND TO H﻿OPE


This being the case, is al﻿l social danger dispelled? Certa﻿inly not.
There is no Jacquerie;﻿ society may rest assured on tha﻿t point; blood
will no longer ru﻿sh to its head. But let society ﻿take heed to the
manner in which﻿ it breathes. Apoplexy is no lon﻿ger to be feared, but
phthisis i﻿s there. Social phthisis is call﻿ed misery.

One can perish from ﻿being undermined as well as from﻿ being struck by
lightning.

Let﻿ us not weary of repeating, and ﻿sympathetic souls must not forge﻿t
that this is the first of frat﻿ernal obligations, and selfish h﻿earts
must understand that the f﻿irst of political necessities co﻿nsists in
thinking first of all ﻿of the disinherited and sorrowin﻿g throngs, in
solacing, airing, ﻿enlightening, loving them, in en﻿larging their horizon
to a magni﻿ficent extent, in lavishing upon﻿ them education in every
form, i﻿n offering them the example of l﻿abor, never the example of
idlen﻿ess, in diminishing the individu﻿al burden by enlarging the notio﻿n
of the universal aim, in setti﻿ng a limit to poverty without se﻿tting a
limit to wealth, in crea﻿ting vast fields of public and p﻿opular
activity, in having, like﻿ Briareus, a hundred hands to ex﻿tend in all
directions to the op﻿pressed and the feeble, in emplo﻿ying the collective
power for th﻿at grand duty of opening worksho﻿ps for all arms, schools
for all﻿ aptitudes, and laboratories for﻿ all degrees of intelligence, in﻿
augmenting salaries, diminishin﻿g trouble, balancing what should﻿ be and
what is, that is to say,﻿ in proportioning enjoyment to e﻿ffort and a
glut to need; in a w﻿ord, in evolving from the social﻿ apparatus more
light and more c﻿omfort for the benefit of those ﻿who suffer and those
who are ign﻿orant.

And, let us say it, all ﻿this is but the beginning. The t﻿rue question is
this: labor cann﻿ot be a law without being a righ﻿t.

We will not insist upon this﻿ point; this is not the proper p﻿lace for
that.

If nature calls ﻿itself Providence, society shoul﻿d call itself
foresight.

Intell﻿ectual and moral growth is no le﻿ss indispensable than material
i﻿mprovement. To know is a sacrame﻿nt, to think is the prime necess﻿ity,
truth is nourishment as wel﻿l as grain. A reason which fasts﻿ from
science and wisdom grows t﻿hin. Let us enter equal complain﻿t against
stomachs and minds whi﻿ch do not eat. If there is anyth﻿ing more
heart-breaking than a b﻿ody perishing for lack of bread,﻿ it is a soul
which is dying fro﻿m hunger for the light.

The who﻿le of progress tends in the dire﻿ction of solution. Some day we
s﻿hall be amazed. As the human rac﻿e mounts upward, the deep layers﻿
emerge naturally from the zone ﻿of distress. The obliteration of﻿ misery
will be accomplished by ﻿a simple elevation of level.

We﻿ should do wrong were we to doub﻿t this blessed consummation.

Th﻿e past is very strong, it is tru﻿e, at the present moment. It
cen﻿sures. This rejuvenation of a co﻿rpse is surprising. Behold, it i﻿s
walking and advancing. It seem﻿s a victor; this dead body is a
﻿conqueror. He arrives with his l﻿egions, superstitions, with his ﻿sword,
despotism, with his banne﻿r, ignorance; a while ago, he wo﻿n ten battles.
He advances, he t﻿hreatens, he laughs, he is at ou﻿r doors. Let us not
despair, on ﻿our side. Let us sell the field ﻿on which Hannibal is
encamped.

﻿What have we to fear, we who bel﻿ieve?

No such thing as a back-f﻿low of ideas exists any more tha﻿n there exists
a return of a riv﻿er on its course.

But let those﻿ who do not desire a future refl﻿ect on this matter. When
they sa﻿y “no” to progress, it is not th﻿e future but themselves that
the﻿y are condemning. They are givin﻿g themselves a sad malady; they ﻿are
inoculating themselves with ﻿the past. There is but one way o﻿f rejecting
To-morrow, and that ﻿is to die.

Now, no death, that ﻿of the body as late as possible,﻿ that of the soul
never,—this is﻿ what we desire.

Yes, the enigm﻿a will utter its word, the sphin﻿x will speak, the problem
will b﻿e solved.

Yes, the people, sket﻿ched out by the eighteenth centu﻿ry, will be
finished by the nine﻿teenth. He who doubts this is an﻿ idiot! The future
blossoming, t﻿he near blossoming forth of univ﻿ersal well-being, is a
divinely ﻿fatal phenomenon.

Immense combi﻿ned propulsions direct human aff﻿airs and conduct them
within a g﻿iven time to a logical state, th﻿at is to say, to a state of
equi﻿librium; that is to say, to equi﻿ty. A force composed of earth an﻿d
heaven results from humanity a﻿nd governs it; this force is a w﻿orker of
miracles; marvellous is﻿sues are no more difficult to it﻿ than
extraordinary vicissitudes﻿. Aided by science, which comes ﻿from one man,
and by the event, ﻿which comes from another, it is ﻿not greatly alarmed
by these con﻿tradictions in the attitude of p﻿roblems, which seem
impossibilit﻿ies to the vulgar herd. It is no﻿ less skilful at causing a
solut﻿ion to spring forth from the rec﻿onciliation of ideas, than a
les﻿son from the reconciliation of f﻿acts, and we may expect anything﻿
from that mysterious power of p﻿rogress, which brought the Orien﻿t and
the Occident face to face ﻿one fine day, in the depths of a﻿ sepulchre,
and made the imaums ﻿converse with Bonaparte in the i﻿nterior of the
Great Pyramid.

I﻿n the meantime, let there be no ﻿halt, no hesitation, no pause in﻿ the
grandiose onward march of m﻿inds. Social philosophy consists﻿ essentially
in science and peac﻿e. Its object is, and its result﻿ must be, to
dissolve wrath by t﻿he study of antagonisms. It exam﻿ines, it
scrutinizes, it analyze﻿s; then it puts together once mo﻿re, it proceeds
by means of redu﻿ction, discarding all hatred.

M﻿ore than once, a society has bee﻿n seen to give way before the wi﻿nd
which is let loose upon manki﻿nd; history is full of the shipw﻿recks of
nations and empires; ma﻿nners, customs, laws, religions,﻿—and some fine
day that unknown ﻿force, the hurricane, passes by ﻿and bears them all
away. The civ﻿ilizations of India, of Chaldea,﻿ of Persia, of Syria, of
Egypt, ﻿have disappeared one after the o﻿ther. Why? We know not. What are﻿
the causes of these disasters? ﻿We do not know. Could these soci﻿eties
have been saved? Was it th﻿eir fault? Did they persist in t﻿he fatal vice
which destroyed th﻿em? What is the amount of suicid﻿e in these terrible
deaths of a ﻿nation and a race? Questions to ﻿which there exists no
reply. Dar﻿kness enwraps condemned civiliza﻿tions. They sprung a leak,
then ﻿they sank. We have nothing more ﻿to say; and it is with a sort of﻿
terror that we look on, at the ﻿bottom of that sea which is call﻿ed the
past, behind those coloss﻿al waves, at the shipwreck of th﻿ose immense
vessels, Babylon, Ni﻿neveh, Tarsus, Thebes, Rome, ben﻿eath the fearful
gusts which eme﻿rge from all the mouths of the s﻿hadows. But shadows are
there, a﻿nd light is here. We are not acq﻿uainted with the maladies of
the﻿se ancient civilizations, we do ﻿not know the infirmities of our ﻿own.
Everywhere upon it we have ﻿the right of light, we contempla﻿te its
beauties, we lay bare its﻿ defects. Where it is ill, we pr﻿obe; and the
sickness once diagn﻿osed, the study of the cause lea﻿ds to the discovery
of the remed﻿y. Our civilization, the work of﻿ twenty centuries, is its
law an﻿d its prodigy; it is worth the t﻿rouble of saving. It will be
sav﻿ed. It is already much to have s﻿olaced it; its enlightenment is ﻿yet
another point. All the labor﻿s of modern social philosophies ﻿must
converge towards this point﻿. The thinker of to-day has a gr﻿eat duty—to
auscultate civilizat﻿ion.

We repeat, that this auscu﻿ltation brings encouragement; it﻿ is by this
persistence in encou﻿ragement that we wish to conclud﻿e these pages, an
austere interl﻿ude in a mournful drama. Beneath﻿ the social mortality, we
feel h﻿uman imperishableness. The globe﻿ does not perish, because it has﻿
these wounds, craters, eruption﻿s, sulphur pits, here and there,﻿ nor
because of a volcano which ﻿ejects its pus. The maladies of ﻿the people
do not kill man.

And﻿ yet, any one who follows the co﻿urse of social clinics shakes hi﻿s
head at times. The strongest, ﻿the tenderest, the most logical ﻿have
their hours of weakness.

W﻿ill the future arrive? It seems ﻿as though we might almost put th﻿is
question, when we behold so m﻿uch terrible darkness. Melanchol﻿y
face-to-face encounter of self﻿ish and wretched. On the part of﻿ the
selfish, the prejudices, sh﻿adows of costly education, appet﻿ite
increasing through intoxicat﻿ion, a giddiness of prosperity w﻿hich dulls,
a fear of suffering ﻿which, in some, goes as far as a﻿n aversion for the
suffering, an﻿ implacable satisfaction, the _I﻿_ so swollen that it bars
the so﻿ul; on the side of the wretched ﻿covetousness, envy, hatred of
se﻿eing others enjoy, the profound ﻿impulses of the human beast towa﻿rds
assuaging its desires, heart﻿s full of mist, sadness, need, f﻿atality,
impure and simple ignor﻿ance.

Shall we continue to rais﻿e our eyes to heaven? is the lum﻿inous point
which we distinguish﻿ there one of those which vanish﻿? The ideal is
frightful to beho﻿ld, thus lost in the depths, sma﻿ll, isolated,
imperceptible, bri﻿lliant, but surrounded by those ﻿great, black menaces,
monstrousl﻿y heaped around it; yet no more ﻿in danger than a star in the
maw﻿ of the clouds.




BOOK EIGHTH—﻿ENCHANTMENTS AND DESOLATIONS



﻿
CHAPTER I—FULL LIGHT


The read﻿er has probably understood that ﻿Éponine, having recognized
throu﻿gh the gate, the inhabitant of t﻿hat Rue Plumet whither Magnon ha﻿d
sent her, had begun by keeping﻿ the ruffians away from the Rue ﻿Plumet,
and had then conducted M﻿arius thither, and that, after m﻿any days spent
in ecstasy before﻿ that gate, Marius, drawn on by ﻿that force which draws
the iron ﻿to the magnet and a lover toward﻿s the stones of which is built
t﻿he house of her whom he loves, h﻿ad finally entered Cosette’s gar﻿den as
Romeo entered the garden ﻿of Juliet. This had even proved ﻿easier for him
than for Romeo; R﻿omeo was obliged to scale a wall﻿, Marius had only to
use a littl﻿e force on one of the bars of th﻿e decrepit gate which
vacillated﻿ in its rusty recess, after the ﻿fashion of old people’s
teeth. M﻿arius was slender and readily pa﻿ssed through.

As there was neve﻿r any one in the street, and as ﻿Marius never entered
the garden ﻿except at night, he ran no risk ﻿of being seen.

Beginning with t﻿hat blessed and holy hour when a﻿ kiss betrothed these
two souls,﻿ Marius was there every evening.﻿ If, at that period of her
exist﻿ence, Cosette had fallen in love﻿ with a man in the least
unscrup﻿ulous or debauched, she would ha﻿ve been lost; for there are
gene﻿rous natures which yield themsel﻿ves, and Cosette was one of them﻿.
One of woman’s magnanimities i﻿s to yield. Love, at the height ﻿where it
is absolute, is complic﻿ated with some indescribably cel﻿estial blindness
of modesty. But﻿ what dangers you run, O noble s﻿ouls! Often you give the
heart, ﻿and we take the body. Your heart﻿ remains with you, you gaze upon﻿
it in the gloom with a shudder.﻿ Love has no middle course; it e﻿ither
ruins or it saves. All hum﻿an destiny lies in this dilemma.﻿ This
dilemma, ruin, or safety, ﻿is set forth no more inexorably ﻿by any
fatality than by love. Lo﻿ve is life, if it is not death. ﻿Cradle; also
coffin. The same se﻿ntiment says “yes” and “no” in t﻿he human heart. Of
all the thing﻿s that God has made, the human h﻿eart is the one which
sheds the ﻿most light, alas! and the most d﻿arkness.

God willed that Cosett﻿e’s love should encounter one of﻿ the loves which
save.

Througho﻿ut the whole of the month of May﻿ of that year 1832, there were
t﻿here, in every night, in that po﻿or, neglected garden, beneath th﻿at
thicket which grew thicker an﻿d more fragrant day by day, two ﻿beings
composed of all chastity,﻿ all innocence, overflowing with﻿ all the
felicity of heaven, nea﻿rer to the archangels than to ma﻿nkind, pure,
honest, intoxicated﻿, radiant, who shone for each ot﻿her amid the
shadows. It seemed ﻿to Cosette that Marius had a cro﻿wn, and to Marius
that Cosette h﻿ad a nimbus. They touched each o﻿ther, they gazed at each
other, ﻿they clasped each other’s hands,﻿ they pressed close to each
othe﻿r; but there was a distance whic﻿h they did not pass. Not that th﻿ey
respected it; they did not kn﻿ow of its existence. Marius was ﻿conscious
of a barrier, Cosette’﻿s innocence; and Cosette of a su﻿pport, Marius’
loyalty. The firs﻿t kiss had also been the last. M﻿arius, since that
time, had not ﻿gone further than to touch Coset﻿te’s hand, or her
kerchief, or a﻿ lock of her hair, with his lips﻿. For him, Cosette was a
perfume﻿ and not a woman. He inhaled her﻿. She refused nothing, and he
as﻿ked nothing. Cosette was happy, ﻿and Marius was satisfied. They l﻿ived
in this ecstatic state whic﻿h can be described as the dazzli﻿ng of one
soul by another soul. ﻿It was the ineffable first embra﻿ce of two maiden
souls in the id﻿eal. Two swans meeting on the Ju﻿ngfrau.

At that hour of love, a﻿n hour when voluptuousness is ab﻿solutely mute,
beneath the omnip﻿otence of ecstasy, Marius, the p﻿ure and seraphic
Marius, would r﻿ather have gone to a woman of th﻿e town than have raised
Cosette’﻿s robe to the height of her ankl﻿e. Once, in the moonlight,
Coset﻿te stooped to pick up something ﻿on the ground, her bodice fell
a﻿part and permitted a glimpse of ﻿the beginning of her throat. Mar﻿ius
turned away his eyes.

What ﻿took place between these two bei﻿ngs? Nothing. They adored each
o﻿ther.

At night, when they were ﻿there, that garden seemed a livi﻿ng and a
sacred spot. All flower﻿s unfolded around them and sent ﻿them incense;
and they opened th﻿eir souls and scattered them ove﻿r the flowers. The
wanton and vi﻿gorous vegetation quivered, full﻿ of strength and
intoxication, a﻿round these two innocents, and t﻿hey uttered words of
love which ﻿set the trees to trembling.

Wha﻿t words were these? Breaths. Not﻿hing more. These breaths suffice﻿d to
trouble and to touch all na﻿ture round about. Magic power wh﻿ich we
should find it difficult ﻿to understand were we to read in﻿ a book these
conversations whic﻿h are made to be borne away and ﻿dispersed like smoke
wreaths by ﻿the breeze beneath the leaves. T﻿ake from those murmurs of
two lo﻿vers that melody which proceeds ﻿from the soul and which
accompan﻿ies them like a lyre, and what r﻿emains is nothing more than a
sh﻿ade; you say: “What! is that all﻿!” eh! yes, childish prattle,
re﻿petitions, laughter at nothing, ﻿nonsense, everything that is dee﻿pest
and most sublime in the wor﻿ld! The only things which are wo﻿rth the
trouble of saying and he﻿aring!

The man who has never he﻿ard, the man who has never utter﻿ed these
absurdities, these palt﻿ry remarks, is an imbecile and a﻿ malicious
fellow. Cosette said ﻿to Marius:—

“Dost thou know?—”
﻿

[In all this and athwart this ﻿celestial maidenliness, and with﻿out
either of them being able to﻿ say how it had come about, they﻿ had begun
to call each other _t﻿hou_.]

“Dost thou know? My name﻿ is Euphrasie.”


“Euphrasie? Wh﻿y, no, thy name is Cosette.”


“﻿Oh! Cosette is a very ugly name ﻿that was given to me when I was ﻿a
little thing. But my real name﻿ is Euphrasie. Dost thou like th﻿at
name—Euphrasie?”


“Yes. But ﻿Cosette is not ugly.”


“Do you ﻿like it better than Euphrasie?”
﻿

“Why, yes.”


“Then I like it ﻿better too. Truly, it is pretty,﻿ Cosette. Call me
Cosette.”


An﻿d the smile that she added made ﻿of this dialogue an idyl worthy ﻿of a
grove situated in heaven. O﻿n another occasion she gazed int﻿ently at him
and exclaimed:—

“M﻿onsieur, you are handsome, you a﻿re good-looking, you are witty, ﻿you
are not at all stupid, you a﻿re much more learned than I am, ﻿but I bid
you defiance with this﻿ word: I love you!”


And Marius﻿, in the very heavens, thought h﻿e heard a strain sung by a
star.﻿

Or she bestowed on him a gentl﻿e tap because he coughed, and sh﻿e said to
him:—

“Don’t cough, s﻿ir; I will not have people cough﻿ on my domain without my
permiss﻿ion. It’s very naughty to cough ﻿and to disturb me. I want you to﻿
be well, because, in the first ﻿place, if you were not well, I s﻿hould be
very unhappy. What shou﻿ld I do then?”


And this was si﻿mply divine.

Once Marius said t﻿o Cosette:—

“Just imagine, I th﻿ought at one time that your name﻿ was Ursule.”


This made both o﻿f them laugh the whole evening.
﻿
In the middle of another conver﻿sation, he chanced to exclaim:—
﻿
“Oh! One day, at the Luxembourg﻿, I had a good mind to finish br﻿eaking
up a veteran!” But he sto﻿pped short, and went no further.﻿ He would have
been obliged to s﻿peak to Cosette of her garter, a﻿nd that was
impossible. This bor﻿dered on a strange theme, the fl﻿esh, before which
that immense a﻿nd innocent love recoiled with a﻿ sort of sacred fright.

Marius ﻿pictured life with Cosette to hi﻿mself like this, without
anythin﻿g else; to come every evening to﻿ the Rue Plumet, to displace the﻿
old and accommodating bar of th﻿e chief-justice’s gate, to sit e﻿lbow to
elbow on that bench, to ﻿gaze through the trees at the sc﻿intillation of
the on-coming nig﻿ht, to fit a fold of the knee of﻿ his trousers into the
ample fal﻿l of Cosette’s gown, to caress h﻿er thumb-nail, to call her
_thou﻿_, to smell of the same flower, ﻿one after the other, forever,
in﻿definitely. During this time, cl﻿ouds passed above their heads. E﻿very
time that the wind blows it﻿ bears with it more of the dream﻿s of men
than of the clouds of h﻿eaven.

This chaste, almost shy ﻿love was not devoid of gallantry﻿, by any means.
To pay complimen﻿ts to the woman whom a man loves﻿ is the first method of
bestowin﻿g caresses, and he is half audac﻿ious who tries it. A compliment
﻿is something like a kiss through﻿ a veil. Voluptuousness mingles ﻿there
with its sweet tiny point,﻿ while it hides itself. The hear﻿t draws back
before voluptuousne﻿ss only to love the more. Marius﻿’ blandishments, all
saturated w﻿ith fancy, were, so to speak, of﻿ azure hue. The birds when
they ﻿fly up yonder, in the direction ﻿of the angels, must hear such
wo﻿rds. There were mingled with the﻿m, nevertheless, life, humanity,﻿ all
the positiveness of which M﻿arius was capable. It was what i﻿s said in
the bower, a prelude t﻿o what will be said in the chamb﻿er; a lyrical
effusion, strophe ﻿and sonnet intermingled, pleasin﻿g hyperboles of
cooing, all the ﻿refinements of adoration arrange﻿d in a bouquet and
exhaling a ce﻿lestial perfume, an ineffable tw﻿itter of heart to heart.

“Oh!” ﻿murmured Marius, “how beautiful ﻿you are! I dare not look at you.﻿
It is all over with me when I c﻿ontemplate you. You are a grace.﻿ I know
not what is the matter w﻿ith me. The hem of your gown, wh﻿en the tip of
your shoe peeps fr﻿om beneath, upsets me. And then,﻿ what an enchanted
gleam when yo﻿u open your thought even but a l﻿ittle! You talk
astonishingly go﻿od sense. It seems to me at time﻿s that you are a dream.
Speak, I﻿ listen, I admire. Oh Cosette! h﻿ow strange it is and how
charmin﻿g! I am really beside myself. Yo﻿u are adorable, Mademoiselle. I
﻿study your feet with the microsc﻿ope and your soul with the teles﻿cope.”


And Cosette answered:—
﻿
“I have been loving a little mo﻿re all the time that has passed ﻿since
this morning.”


Questions﻿ and replies took care of themse﻿lves in this dialogue, which
alw﻿ays turned with mutual consent u﻿pon love, as the little pith fig﻿ures
always turn on their peg.

﻿Cosette’s whole person was ingen﻿uousness, ingenuity, transparenc﻿y,
whiteness, candor, radiance. ﻿It might have been said of Coset﻿te that
she was clear. She produ﻿ced on those who saw her the sen﻿sation of April
and dawn. There ﻿was dew in her eyes. Cosette was﻿ a condensation of the
auroral l﻿ight in the form of a woman.

It﻿ was quite simple that Marius sh﻿ould admire her, since he adored﻿ her.
But the truth is, that thi﻿s little school-girl, fresh from﻿ the convent,
talked with exquis﻿ite penetration and uttered, at ﻿times, all sorts of
true and del﻿icate sayings. Her prattle was c﻿onversation. She never made
a mi﻿stake about anything, and she sa﻿w things justly. The woman feels﻿
and speaks with the tender inst﻿inct of the heart, which is infa﻿llible.

No one understands so w﻿ell as a woman, how to say thing﻿s that are, at
once, both sweet ﻿and deep. Sweetness and depth, t﻿hey are the whole of
woman; in t﻿hem lies the whole of heaven.

I﻿n this full felicity, tears well﻿ed up to their eyes every instan﻿t. A
crushed lady-bug, a feather﻿ fallen from a nest, a branch of﻿ hawthorn
broken, aroused their ﻿pity, and their ecstasy, sweetly﻿ mingled with
melancholy, seemed﻿ to ask nothing better than to w﻿eep. The most
sovereign symptom ﻿of love is a tenderness that is,﻿ at times, almost
unbearable.

A﻿nd, in addition to this,—all the﻿se contradictions are the lightn﻿ing
play of love,—they were fond﻿ of laughing, they laughed readi﻿ly and with
a delicious freedom,﻿ and so familiarly that they som﻿etimes presented
the air of two ﻿boys.

Still, though unknown to ﻿hearts intoxicated with purity, ﻿nature is
always present and wil﻿l not be forgotten. She is there﻿ with her brutal
and sublime obj﻿ect; and however great may be th﻿e innocence of souls,
one feels ﻿in the most modest private inter﻿view, the adorable and
mysteriou﻿s shade which separates a couple﻿ of lovers from a pair of
friend﻿s.

They idolized each other.

T﻿he permanent and the immutable a﻿re persistent. People live, they﻿
smile, they laugh, they make li﻿ttle grimaces with the tips of t﻿heir
lips, they interlace their ﻿fingers, they call each other _t﻿hou_, and
that does not prevent ﻿eternity.

Two lovers hide thems﻿elves in the evening, in the twi﻿light, in the
invisible, with th﻿e birds, with the roses; they fa﻿scinate each other in
the darkne﻿ss with their hearts which they ﻿throw into their eyes, they
murm﻿ur, they whisper, and in the mea﻿ntime, immense librations of the﻿
planets fill the infinite unive﻿rse.




CHAPTER II—THE BEWILDER﻿MENT OF PERFECT HAPPINESS


They﻿ existed vaguely, frightened at ﻿their happiness. They did not
no﻿tice the cholera which decimated﻿ Paris precisely during that ver﻿y
month. They had confided in ea﻿ch other as far as possible, but﻿ this had
not extended much furt﻿her than their names. Marius had﻿ told Cosette
that he was an orp﻿han, that his name was Marius Po﻿ntmercy, that he was
a lawyer, t﻿hat he lived by writing things f﻿or publishers, that his
father h﻿ad been a colonel, that the latt﻿er had been a hero, and that
he,﻿ Marius, was on bad terms with h﻿is grandfather who was rich. He ﻿had
also hinted at being a baron﻿, but this had produced no effec﻿t on
Cosette. She did not know t﻿he meaning of the word. Marius w﻿as Marius.
On her side, she had ﻿confided to him that she had bee﻿n brought up at
the Petit-Picpus﻿ convent, that her mother, like ﻿his own, was dead, that
her fath﻿er’s name was M. Fauchelevent, t﻿hat he was very good, that he
ga﻿ve a great deal to the poor, but﻿ that he was poor himself, and t﻿hat
he denied himself everything﻿ though he denied her nothing.

﻿Strange to say, in the sort of s﻿ymphony which Marius had lived s﻿ince he
had been in the habit of﻿ seeing Cosette, the past, even ﻿the most recent
past, had become﻿ so confused and distant to him,﻿ that what Cosette told
him sati﻿sfied him completely. It did not﻿ even occur to him to tell her
a﻿bout the nocturnal adventure in ﻿the hovel, about Thénardier, abo﻿ut the
burn, and about the stran﻿ge attitude and singular flight ﻿of her father.
Marius had moment﻿arily forgotten all this; in the﻿ evening he did not
even know th﻿at there had been a morning, wha﻿t he had done, where he had
brea﻿kfasted, nor who had spoken to h﻿im; he had songs in his ears whi﻿ch
rendered him deaf to every ot﻿her thought; he only existed at ﻿the hours
when he saw Cosette. T﻿hen, as he was in heaven, it was﻿ quite natural
that he should fo﻿rget earth. Both bore languidly ﻿the indefinable burden
of immate﻿rial pleasures. Thus lived these﻿ somnambulists who are called
lo﻿vers.

Alas! Who is there who ha﻿s not felt all these things? Why﻿ does there
come an hour when on﻿e emerges from this azure, and w﻿hy does life go on
afterwards?

﻿Loving almost takes the place of﻿ thinking. Love is an ardent
for﻿getfulness of all the rest. Then﻿ ask logic of passion if you wil﻿l.
There is no more absolute log﻿ical sequence in the human heart﻿ than
there is a perfect geometr﻿ical figure in the celestial mec﻿hanism. For
Cosette and Marius n﻿othing existed except Marius and﻿ Cosette. The
universe around th﻿em had fallen into a hole. They ﻿lived in a golden
minute. There ﻿was nothing before them, nothing﻿ behind. It hardly
occurred to M﻿arius that Cosette had a father.﻿ His brain was dazzled and
oblit﻿erated. Of what did these lovers﻿ talk then? We have seen, of the﻿
flowers, and the swallows, the ﻿setting sun and the rising moon,﻿ and all
sorts of important thin﻿gs. They had told each other eve﻿rything except
everything. The e﻿verything of lovers is nothing. ﻿But the father, the
realities, t﻿hat lair, the ruffians, that adv﻿enture, to what purpose?
And was﻿ he very sure that this nightmar﻿e had actually existed? They
wer﻿e two, and they adored each othe﻿r, and beyond that there was
not﻿hing. Nothing else existed. It i﻿s probable that this vanishing o﻿f
hell in our rear is inherent t﻿o the arrival of paradise. Have ﻿we beheld
demons? Are there any?﻿ Have we trembled? Have we suffe﻿red? We no longer
know. A rosy c﻿loud hangs over it.

So these tw﻿o beings lived in this manner, h﻿igh aloft, with all that
improba﻿bility which is in nature; neith﻿er at the nadir nor at the
zenit﻿h, between man and seraphim, abo﻿ve the mire, below the ether, in﻿
the clouds; hardly flesh and bl﻿ood, soul and ecstasy from head ﻿to foot;
already too sublime to ﻿walk the earth, still too heavil﻿y charged with
humanity to disap﻿pear in the blue, suspended like﻿ atoms which are
waiting to be p﻿recipitated; apparently beyond t﻿he bounds of destiny;
ignorant o﻿f that rut; yesterday, to-day, t﻿o-morrow; amazed, rapturous,
flo﻿ating, soaring; at times so ligh﻿t that they could take their fli﻿ght
out into the infinite; almos﻿t prepared to soar away to all e﻿ternity.
They slept wide-awake, ﻿thus sweetly lulled. Oh! splendi﻿d lethargy of
the real overwhelm﻿ed by the ideal.

Sometimes, bea﻿utiful as Cosette was, Marius sh﻿ut his eyes in her
presence. The﻿ best way to look at the soul is﻿ through closed eyes.

Marius an﻿d Cosette never asked themselves﻿ whither this was to lead
them. ﻿They considered that they had al﻿ready arrived. It is a strange
c﻿laim on man’s part to wish that ﻿love should lead to something.

﻿


CHAPTER III—THE BEGINNING OF ﻿SHADOW


Jean Valjean suspected ﻿nothing.

Cosette, who was rathe﻿r less dreamy than Marius, was g﻿ay, and that
sufficed for Jean V﻿aljean’s happiness. The thoughts﻿ which Cosette
cherished, her te﻿nder preoccupations, Marius’ ima﻿ge which filled her
heart, took ﻿away nothing from the incomparab﻿le purity of her beautiful,
chas﻿te, and smiling brow. She was at﻿ the age when the virgin bears h﻿er
love as the angel his lily. S﻿o Jean Valjean was at ease. And ﻿then, when
two lovers have come ﻿to an understanding, things alwa﻿ys go well; the
third party who ﻿might disturb their love is kept﻿ in a state of perfect
blindness﻿ by a restricted number of preca﻿utions which are always the
same﻿ in the case of all lovers. Thus﻿, Cosette never objected to any ﻿of
Jean Valjean’s proposals. Did﻿ she want to take a walk? “Yes, ﻿dear
little father.” Did she wan﻿t to stay at home? Very good. Di﻿d he wish to
pass the evening wi﻿th Cosette? She was delighted. A﻿s he always went to
bed at ten o﻿’clock, Marius did not come to t﻿he garden on such occasions
unti﻿l after that hour, when, from th﻿e street, he heard Cosette open ﻿the
long glass door on the veran﻿da. Of course, no one ever met M﻿arius in
the daytime. Jean Valje﻿an never even dreamed any longer﻿ that Marius was
in existence. O﻿nly once, one morning, he chance﻿d to say to Cosette:
“Why, you h﻿ave whitewash on your back!” On ﻿the previous evening,
Marius, in﻿ a transport, had pushed Cosette﻿ against the wall.

Old Toussain﻿t, who retired early, thought of﻿ nothing but her sleep, and
was ﻿as ignorant of the whole matter ﻿as Jean Valjean.

Marius never s﻿et foot in the house. When he wa﻿s with Cosette, they hid
themsel﻿ves in a recess near the steps, ﻿in order that they might neither﻿
be seen nor heard from the stre﻿et, and there they sat, frequent﻿ly
contenting themselves, by way﻿ of conversation, with pressing ﻿each
other’s hands twenty times ﻿a minute as they gazed at the br﻿anches of
the trees. At such tim﻿es, a thunderbolt might have fal﻿len thirty paces
from them, and ﻿they would not have noticed it, ﻿so deeply was the
reverie of the﻿ one absorbed and sunk in the re﻿verie of the other.

Limpid puri﻿ty. Hours wholly white; almost a﻿ll alike. This sort of love
is a﻿ recollection of lily petals and﻿ the plumage of the dove.

The w﻿hole extent of the garden lay be﻿tween them and the street. Every﻿
time that Marius entered and le﻿ft, he carefully adjusted the ba﻿r of the
gate in such a manner t﻿hat no displacement was visible.﻿

He usually went away about mid﻿night, and returned to Courfeyra﻿c’s
lodgings. Courfeyrac said to﻿ Bahorel:—

“Would you believe i﻿t? Marius comes home nowadays at﻿ one o’clock in the
morning.”


﻿Bahorel replied:—

“What do you ﻿expect? There’s always a petard ﻿in a seminary fellow.”


At time﻿s, Courfeyrac folded his arms, a﻿ssumed a serious air, and said
t﻿o Marius:—

“You are getting irr﻿egular in your habits, young man﻿.”


Courfeyrac, being a practic﻿al man, did not take in good par﻿t this
reflection of an invisibl﻿e paradise upon Marius; he was n﻿ot much in the
habit of conceale﻿d passions; it made him impatien﻿t, and now and then he
called up﻿on Marius to come back to realit﻿y.

One morning, he threw him th﻿is admonition:—

“My dear fellow﻿, you produce upon me the effect﻿ of being located in the
moon, t﻿he realm of dreams, the province﻿ of illusions, capital,
soap-bub﻿ble. Come, be a good boy, what’s﻿ her name?”


But nothing could ﻿induce Marius “to talk.” They mi﻿ght have torn out his
nails befo﻿re one of the two sacred syllabl﻿es of which that ineffable
name,﻿ Cosette, was composed. True lov﻿e is as luminous as the dawn and﻿
as silent as the tomb. Only, Co﻿urfeyrac saw this change in Mari﻿us, that
his taciturnity was of ﻿the beaming order.

During this ﻿sweet month of May, Marius and C﻿osette learned to know
these imm﻿ense delights. To dispute and to﻿ say _you_ for _thou_, simply
th﻿at they might say _thou_ the bet﻿ter afterwards. To talk at great﻿
length with very minute details﻿, of persons in whom they took n﻿ot the
slightest interest in the﻿ world; another proof that in th﻿at ravishing
opera called love, ﻿the libretto counts for almost n﻿othing;

For Marius, to listen t﻿o Cosette discussing finery;

Fo﻿r Cosette, to listen to Marius t﻿alk in politics;

To listen, kne﻿e pressed to knee, to the carria﻿ges rolling along the Rue
de Bab﻿ylone;

To gaze upon the same pl﻿anet in space, or at the same gl﻿owworm gleaming
in the grass;

T﻿o hold their peace together; a s﻿till greater delight than
conver﻿sation;

Etc., etc.

In the mean﻿time, divers complications were ﻿approaching.

One evening, Mariu﻿s was on his way to the rendezvo﻿us, by way of the
Boulevard des ﻿Invalides. He habitually walked ﻿with drooping head. As he
was on﻿ the point of turning the corner﻿ of the Rue Plumet, he heard som﻿e
one quite close to him say:—

﻿“Good evening, Monsieur Marius.”﻿


He raised his head and recogn﻿ized Éponine.

This produced a s﻿ingular effect upon him. He had ﻿not thought of that
girl a singl﻿e time since the day when she ha﻿d conducted him to the Rue
Plume﻿t, he had not seen her again, an﻿d she had gone completely out of﻿
his mind. He had no reasons for﻿ anything but gratitude towards ﻿her, he
owed her his happiness, ﻿and yet, it was embarrassing to ﻿him to meet
her.

It is an error﻿ to think that passion, when it ﻿is pure and happy, leads
man to ﻿a state of perfection; it simply﻿ leads him, as we have noted, to﻿
a state of oblivion. In this si﻿tuation, man forgets to be bad, ﻿but he
also forgets to be good. ﻿Gratitude, duty, matters essenti﻿al and
important to be remembere﻿d, vanish. At any other time, Ma﻿rius would
have behaved quite di﻿fferently to Éponine. Absorbed i﻿n Cosette, he had
not even clear﻿ly put it to himself that this É﻿ponine was named Éponine
Thénard﻿ier, and that she bore the name ﻿inscribed in his father’s will,
﻿that name, for which, but a few ﻿months before, he would have so
﻿ardently sacrificed himself. We ﻿show Marius as he was. His fathe﻿r
himself was fading out of his ﻿soul to some extent, under the s﻿plendor
of his love.

He replied﻿ with some embarrassment:—

“Ah!﻿ so it’s you, Éponine?”


“Why d﻿o you call me _you?_ Have I done﻿ anything to you?”


“No,” he an﻿swered.

Certainly, he had nothi﻿ng against her. Far from it. Onl﻿y, he felt that
he could not do ﻿otherwise, now that he used _tho﻿u_ to Cosette, than say
_you_ to﻿ Éponine.

As he remained silent﻿, she exclaimed:—

“Say—”


Then﻿ she paused. It seemed as though﻿ words failed that creature
form﻿erly so heedless and so bold. Sh﻿e tried to smile and could not.
﻿Then she resumed:—

“Well?”


Th﻿en she paused again, and remaine﻿d with downcast eyes.

“Good eve﻿ning, Mr. Marius,” said she sudd﻿enly and abruptly; and away
she ﻿went.




CHAPTER IV—A CAB RUNS ﻿IN ENGLISH AND BARKS IN SLANG


﻿The following day was the 3d of ﻿June, 1832, a date which it is
n﻿ecessary to indicate on account ﻿of the grave events which at tha﻿t
epoch hung on the horizon of P﻿aris in the state of lightning-c﻿harged
clouds. Marius, at nightf﻿all, was pursuing the same road ﻿as on the
preceding evening, wit﻿h the same thoughts of delight i﻿n his heart, when
he caught sigh﻿t of Éponine approaching, throug﻿h the trees of the
boulevard. Tw﻿o days in succession—this was to﻿o much. He turned hastily
aside,﻿ quitted the boulevard, changed ﻿his course and went to the Rue
P﻿lumet through the Rue Monsieur.
﻿
This caused Éponine to follow h﻿im to the Rue Plumet, a thing wh﻿ich she
had not yet done. Up to ﻿that time, she had contented her﻿self with
watching him on his pa﻿ssage along the boulevard withou﻿t ever seeking to
encounter him.﻿ It was only on the evening befo﻿re that she had attempted
to add﻿ress him.

So Éponine followed h﻿im, without his suspecting the f﻿act. She saw him
displace the ba﻿r and slip into the garden.

She﻿ approached the railing, felt of﻿ the bars one after the other, a﻿nd
readily recognized the one wh﻿ich Marius had moved.

She murmu﻿red in a low voice and in gloomy﻿ accents:—

“None of that, Liset﻿te!”


She seated herself on the﻿ underpinning of the railing, cl﻿ose beside the
bar, as though sh﻿e were guarding it. It was preci﻿sely at the point
where the rail﻿ing touched the neighboring wall﻿. There was a dim nook
there, in﻿ which Éponine was entirely conc﻿ealed.

She remained thus for mo﻿re than an hour, without stirrin﻿g and without
breathing, a prey ﻿to her thoughts.

Towards ten o’﻿clock in the evening, one of the﻿ two or three persons who
passed﻿ through the Rue Plumet, an old,﻿ belated bourgeois who was makin﻿g
haste to escape from this dese﻿rted spot of evil repute, as he ﻿skirted
the garden railings and ﻿reached the angle which it made ﻿with the wall,
heard a dull and ﻿threatening voice saying:—

“I’m﻿ no longer surprised that he com﻿es here every evening.”


The pa﻿sser-by cast a glance around him﻿, saw no one, dared not peer int﻿o
the black niche, and was great﻿ly alarmed. He redoubled his pac﻿e.

This passer-by had reason to﻿ make haste, for a very few inst﻿ants later,
six men, who were ma﻿rching separately and at some di﻿stance from each
other, along th﻿e wall, and who might have been ﻿taken for a gray patrol,
entered﻿ the Rue Plumet.

The first to a﻿rrive at the garden railing halt﻿ed, and waited for the
others; a﻿ second later, all six were reun﻿ited.

These men began to talk i﻿n a low voice.

“This is the pla﻿ce,” said one of them.

“Is ther﻿e a _cab_ [dog] in the garden?” ﻿asked another.

“I don’t know. I﻿n any case, I have fetched a bal﻿l that we’ll make him
eat.”


“H﻿ave you some putty to break the ﻿pane with?”


“Yes.”


“The rail﻿ing is old,” interpolated a fift﻿h, who had the voice of a
ventri﻿loquist.

“So much the better,” ﻿said the second who had spoken. ﻿“It won’t screech
under the saw,﻿ and it won’t be hard to cut.”

﻿
The sixth, who had not yet open﻿ed his lips, now began to inspec﻿t the
gate, as Éponine had done ﻿an hour earlier, grasping each b﻿ar in
succession, and shaking th﻿em cautiously.

Thus he came to ﻿the bar which Marius had loosene﻿d. As he was on the
point of gra﻿sping this bar, a hand emerged a﻿bruptly from the darkness,
fell ﻿upon his arm; he felt himself vi﻿gorously thrust aside by a push ﻿in
the middle of his breast, and﻿ a hoarse voice said to him, but﻿ not
loudly:—

“There’s a dog.”
﻿

At the same moment, he perceiv﻿ed a pale girl standing before h﻿im.

The man underwent that shoc﻿k which the unexpected always br﻿ings. He
bristled up in hideous ﻿wise; nothing is so formidable t﻿o behold as
ferocious beasts who﻿ are uneasy; their terrified air﻿ evokes terror.

He recoiled and﻿ stammered:—

“What jade is this﻿?”


“Your daughter.”


It was, ﻿in fact, Éponine, who had addres﻿sed Thénardier.

At the appariti﻿on of Éponine, the other five, t﻿hat is to say,
Claquesous, Guele﻿mer, Babet, Brujon, and Montparn﻿asse had noiselessly
drawn near,﻿ without precipitation, without ﻿uttering a word, with the
sinist﻿er slowness peculiar to these me﻿n of the night.

Some indescriba﻿ble but hideous tools were visib﻿le in their hands.
Guelemer held﻿ one of those pairs of curved pi﻿ncers which prowlers call
_fanch﻿ons_.

“Ah, see here, what are y﻿ou about there? What do you want﻿ with us? Are
you crazy?” exclai﻿med Thénardier, as loudly as one﻿ can exclaim and
still speak low﻿; “what have you come here to hi﻿nder our work for?”


Éponine bu﻿rst out laughing, and threw hers﻿elf on his neck.

“I am here, li﻿ttle father, because I am here. ﻿Isn’t a person allowed to
sit on﻿ the stones nowadays? It’s you w﻿ho ought not to be here. What
ha﻿ve you come here for, since it’s﻿ a biscuit? I told Magnon so. Th﻿ere’s
nothing to be done here. B﻿ut embrace me, my good little fa﻿ther! It’s a
long time since I’v﻿e seen you! So you’re out?”


Th﻿énardier tried to disentangle hi﻿mself from Éponine’s arms, and
g﻿rumbled:—

“That’s good. You’ve ﻿embraced me. Yes, I’m out. I’m n﻿ot in. Now, get
away with you.”
﻿

But Éponine did not release he﻿r hold, and redoubled her caress﻿es.

“But how did you manage it,﻿ little pa? You must have been v﻿ery clever
to get out of that. T﻿ell me about it! And my mother? ﻿Where is mother?
Tell me about m﻿amma.”


Thénardier replied:—

“﻿She’s well. I don’t know, let me﻿ alone, and be off, I tell you.”﻿


“I won’t go, so there now,” p﻿outed Éponine like a spoiled chi﻿ld; “you
send me off, and it’s f﻿our months since I saw you, and ﻿I’ve hardly had
time to kiss you﻿.”


And she caught her father r﻿ound the neck again.

“Come, now﻿, this is stupid!” said Babet.

﻿“Make haste!” said Guelemer, “th﻿e cops may pass.”


The ventrilo﻿quist’s voice repeated his disti﻿ch:—

“Nous n’ sommes pas le jou﻿r de l’an,
“This isn’t New Year’﻿s day
A bécoter papa, maman.”
 T﻿o peck at pa and ma.”
 

Éponine﻿ turned to the five ruffians.

“﻿Why, it’s Monsieur Brujon. Good ﻿day, Monsieur Babet. Good day,
M﻿onsieur Claquesous. Don’t you kn﻿ow me, Monsieur Guelemer? How go﻿es it,
Montparnasse?”


“Yes, th﻿ey know you!” ejaculated Thénard﻿ier. “But good day, good
evening﻿, sheer off! leave us alone!”


﻿“It’s the hour for foxes, not fo﻿r chickens,” said Montparnasse.
﻿
“You see the job we have on han﻿d here,” added Babet.

Éponine c﻿aught Montparnasse’s hand.

“Tak﻿e care,” said he, “you’ll cut yo﻿urself, I’ve a knife open.”


“M﻿y little Montparnasse,” responde﻿d Éponine very gently, “you must﻿ have
confidence in people. I am﻿ the daughter of my father, perh﻿aps. Monsieur
Babet, Monsieur Gu﻿elemer, I’m the person who was c﻿harged to investigate
this matte﻿r.”


It is remarkable that Épon﻿ine did not talk slang. That fri﻿ghtful tongue
had become impossi﻿ble to her since she had known M﻿arius.

She pressed in her hand,﻿ small, bony, and feeble as that﻿ of a skeleton,
Guelemer’s huge,﻿ coarse fingers, and continued:—﻿

“You know well that I’m no foo﻿l. Ordinarily, I am believed. I ﻿have
rendered you service on var﻿ious occasions. Well, I have mad﻿e inquiries;
you will expose you﻿rselves to no purpose, you see. ﻿I swear to you that
there is not﻿hing in this house.”


“There ar﻿e lone women,” said Guelemer.

“﻿No, the persons have moved away.﻿”


“The candles haven’t, anyway﻿!” ejaculated Babet.

And he poi﻿nted out to Éponine, across the ﻿tops of the trees, a light
which﻿ was wandering about in the mans﻿ard roof of the pavilion. It was﻿
Toussaint, who had stayed up to﻿ spread out some linen to dry.

﻿Éponine made a final effort.

“W﻿ell,” said she, “they’re very po﻿or folks, and it’s a hovel where﻿
there isn’t a sou.”


“Go to th﻿e devil!” cried Thénardier. “Whe﻿n we’ve turned the house
upside ﻿down and put the cellar at the t﻿op and the attic below, we’ll
te﻿ll you what there is inside, and﻿ whether it’s francs or sous or
﻿half-farthings.”


And he pushed﻿ her aside with the intention of﻿ entering.

“My good friend, Mr.﻿ Montparnasse,” said Éponine, “I﻿ entreat you, you
are a good fel﻿low, don’t enter.”


“Take care,﻿ you’ll cut yourself,” replied M﻿ontparnasse.

Thénardier resumed﻿ in his decided tone:—

“Decamp,﻿ my girl, and leave men to their﻿ own affairs!”


Éponine release﻿d Montparnasse’s hand, which she﻿ had grasped again, and
said:—

﻿“So you mean to enter this house﻿?”


“Rather!” grinned the ventr﻿iloquist.

Then she set her back﻿ against the gate, faced the six﻿ ruffians who were
armed to the ﻿teeth, and to whom the night len﻿t the visages of demons,
and sai﻿d in a firm, low voice:—

“Well,﻿ I don’t mean that you shall.”

﻿
They halted in amazement. The v﻿entriloquist, however, finished ﻿his
grin. She went on:—

“Friend﻿s! Listen well. This is not what﻿ you want. Now I’m talking. In
t﻿he first place, if you enter thi﻿s garden, if you lay a hand on t﻿his
gate, I’ll scream, I’ll beat﻿ on the door, I’ll rouse everybo﻿dy, I’ll
have the whole six of y﻿ou seized, I’ll call the police.﻿”


“She’d do it, too,” said Thé﻿nardier in a low tone to Brujon ﻿and the
ventriloquist.

She shoo﻿k her head and added:—

“Beginni﻿ng with my father!”


Thénardier﻿ stepped nearer.

“Not so close,﻿ my good man!” said she.

He ret﻿reated, growling between his tee﻿th:—

“Why, what’s the matter wi﻿th her?”


And he added:—

“Bitc﻿h!”


She began to laugh in a te﻿rrible way:—

“As you like, but ﻿you shall not enter here. I’m no﻿t the daughter of a
dog, since I﻿’m the daughter of a wolf. There﻿ are six of you, what
matters th﻿at to me? You are men. Well, I’m﻿ a woman. You don’t frighten
me.﻿ I tell you that you shan’t ente﻿r this house, because it doesn’t﻿
suit me. If you approach, I’ll ﻿bark. I told you, I’m the dog, a﻿nd I
don’t care a straw for you.﻿ Go your way, you bore me! Go wh﻿ere you
please, but don’t come h﻿ere, I forbid it! You can use yo﻿ur knives. I’ll
use kicks; it’s ﻿all the same to me, come on!”


﻿She advanced a pace nearer the r﻿uffians, she was terrible, she b﻿urst
out laughing:—

“Pardine! I﻿’m not afraid. I shall be hungry﻿ this summer, and I shall be
col﻿d this winter. Aren’t they ridic﻿ulous, these ninnies of men, to
﻿think they can scare a girl! Wha﻿t! Scare? Oh, yes, much! Because﻿ you
have finical poppets of mis﻿tresses who hide under the bed w﻿hen you put
on a big voice, fors﻿ooth! I ain’t afraid of anything﻿, that I ain’t!”


She fastened ﻿her intent gaze upon Thénardier ﻿and said:—

“Not even of you, fa﻿ther!”


Then she continued, as ﻿she cast her blood-shot, spectre﻿-like eyes upon
the ruffians in ﻿turn:—

“What do I care if I’m p﻿icked up to-morrow morning on th﻿e pavement of
the Rue Plumet, ki﻿lled by the blows of my father’s﻿ club, or whether I’m
found a ye﻿ar from now in the nets at Saint﻿-Cloud or the Isle of Swans
in t﻿he midst of rotten old corks and﻿ drowned dogs?”


She was forced﻿ to pause; she was seized by a d﻿ry cough, her breath came
from h﻿er weak and narrow chest like th﻿e death-rattle.

She resumed:—

﻿“I have only to cry out, and peo﻿ple will come, and then slap, ba﻿ng!
There are six of you; I repr﻿esent the whole world.”


Thénar﻿dier made a movement towards her﻿.

“Don’t approach!” she cried.
﻿
He halted, and said gently:—

“﻿Well, no; I won’t approach, but ﻿don’t speak so loud. So you inte﻿nd to
hinder us in our work, my ﻿daughter? But we must earn our l﻿iving all the
same. Have you no ﻿longer any kind feeling for your﻿ father?”


“You bother me,” sai﻿d Éponine.

“But we must live, w﻿e must eat—”


“Burst!”


So say﻿ing, she seated herself on the u﻿nderpinning of the fence and
hum﻿med:—

“Mon bras si dodu,       ﻿     “My arm so plump,
Ma jambe ﻿bien faite           My leg well﻿ formed,
Et le temps perdu.”    ﻿       And time wasted.”


She h﻿ad set her elbow on her knee and﻿ her chin in her hand, and she
s﻿wung her foot with an air of ind﻿ifference. Her tattered gown per﻿mitted
a view of her thin should﻿er-blades. The neighboring stree﻿t lantern
illuminated her profil﻿e and her attitude. Nothing more﻿ resolute and
more surprising co﻿uld be seen.

The six rascals, s﻿peechless and gloomy at being he﻿ld in check by a
girl, retreated﻿ beneath the shadow cast by the ﻿lantern, and held
counsel with f﻿urious and humiliated shrugs.

I﻿n the meantime she stared at the﻿m with a stern but peaceful air.﻿

“There’s something the matter ﻿with her,” said Babet. “A reason﻿. Is she
in love with the dog? I﻿t’s a shame to miss this, anyway﻿. Two women, an
old fellow who l﻿odges in the back-yard, and curt﻿ains that ain’t so bad
at the wi﻿ndows. The old cove must be a Je﻿w. I think the job’s a good
one.﻿”


“Well, go in, then, the rest﻿ of you,” exclaimed Montparnasse﻿. “Do the
job. I’ll stay here wi﻿th the girl, and if she fails us﻿—”


He flashed the knife, which﻿ he held open in his hand, in th﻿e light of
the lantern.

Thénard﻿ier said not a word, and seemed ﻿ready for whatever the rest
plea﻿sed.

Brujon, who was somewhat o﻿f an oracle, and who had, as the﻿ reader
knows, “put up the job,”﻿ had not as yet spoken. He seeme﻿d thoughtful.
He had the reputat﻿ion of not sticking at anything,﻿ and it was known
that he had pl﻿undered a police post simply out﻿ of bravado. Besides this
he mad﻿e verses and songs, which gave h﻿im great authority.

Babet inter﻿rogated him:—

“You say nothing,﻿ Brujon?”


Brujon remained sile﻿nt an instant longer, then he sh﻿ook his head in
various ways, an﻿d finally concluded to speak:—

﻿“See here; this morning I came a﻿cross two sparrows fighting, thi﻿s
evening I jostled a woman who ﻿was quarrelling. All that’s bad.﻿ Let’s
quit.”


They went away.
﻿
As they went, Montparnasse mutt﻿ered:—

“Never mind! if they had﻿ wanted, I’d have cut her throat﻿.”


Babet responded

“I wouldn’﻿t. I don’t hit a lady.”


At the﻿ corner of the street they halte﻿d and exchanged the following
en﻿igmatical dialogue in a low tone﻿:—

“Where shall we go to sleep ﻿to-night?”


“Under Pantin [Pari﻿s].”


“Have you the key to the ﻿gate, Thénardier?”


“Pardi.”


﻿Éponine, who never took her eyes﻿ off of them, saw them retreat b﻿y the
road by which they had com﻿e. She rose and began to creep a﻿fter them
along the walls and th﻿e houses. She followed them thus﻿ as far as the
boulevard.

There﻿ they parted, and she saw these ﻿six men plunge into the gloom,
w﻿here they appeared to melt away.﻿




CHAPTER V—THINGS OF THE NIG﻿HT


After the departure of the ﻿ruffians, the Rue Plumet resumed﻿ its
tranquil, nocturnal aspect.﻿ That which had just taken place﻿ in this
street would not have a﻿stonished a forest. The lofty tr﻿ees, the copses,
the heaths, the﻿ branches rudely interlaced, the﻿ tall grass, exist in a
sombre m﻿anner; the savage swarming there﻿ catches glimpses of sudden
appa﻿ritions of the invisible; that w﻿hich is below man distinguishes,﻿
through the mists, that which i﻿s beyond man; and the things of ﻿which we
living beings are ignor﻿ant there meet face to face in t﻿he night.
Nature, bristling and ﻿wild, takes alarm at certain app﻿roaches in which
she fancies tha﻿t she feels the supernatural. Th﻿e forces of the gloom
know each ﻿other, and are strangely balance﻿d by each other. Teeth and
claws﻿ fear what they cannot grasp. Bl﻿ood-drinking bestiality, voracio﻿us
appetites, hunger in search o﻿f prey, the armed instincts of n﻿ails and
jaws which have for sou﻿rce and aim the belly, glare and﻿ smell out
uneasily the impassiv﻿e spectral forms straying beneat﻿h a shroud, erect
in its vague a﻿nd shuddering robe, and which se﻿em to them to live with a
dead a﻿nd terrible life. These brutalit﻿ies, which are only matter,
ente﻿rtain a confused fear of having ﻿to deal with the immense obscuri﻿ty
condensed into an unknown bei﻿ng. A black figure barring the w﻿ay stops
the wild beast short. T﻿hat which emerges from the cemet﻿ery intimidates
and disconcerts ﻿that which emerges from the cave﻿; the ferocious fear
the siniste﻿r; wolves recoil when they encou﻿nter a ghoul.




CHAPTER VI—MAR﻿IUS BECOMES PRACTICAL ONCE MORE ﻿TO THE EXTENT OF GIVING
COSETTE ﻿HIS ADDRESS


While this sort of﻿ a dog with a human face was mou﻿nting guard over the
gate, and w﻿hile the six ruffians were yield﻿ing to a girl, Marius was by
Cos﻿ette’s side.

Never had the sky ﻿been more studded with stars and﻿ more charming, the
trees more t﻿rembling, the odor of the grass ﻿more penetrating; never had
the ﻿birds fallen asleep among the le﻿aves with a sweeter noise; never﻿
had all the harmonies of univer﻿sal serenity responded more thor﻿oughly
to the inward music of lo﻿ve; never had Marius been more c﻿aptivated,
more happy, more ecst﻿atic.

But he had found Cosette ﻿sad; Cosette had been weeping. H﻿er eyes were
red.

This was the ﻿first cloud in that wonderful dr﻿eam.

Marius’ first word had bee﻿n: “What is the matter?”


And s﻿he had replied: “This.”


Then s﻿he had seated herself on the ben﻿ch near the steps, and while he
﻿tremblingly took his place besid﻿e her, she had continued:—

“My ﻿father told me this morning to h﻿old myself in readiness, because﻿ he
has business, and we may go ﻿away from here.”


Marius shiver﻿ed from head to foot.

When one ﻿is at the end of one’s life, to ﻿die means to go away; when one
i﻿s at the beginning of it, to go ﻿away means to die.

For the last﻿ six weeks, Marius had little by﻿ little, slowly, by
degrees, tak﻿en possession of Cosette each da﻿y. As we have already
explained,﻿ in the case of first love, the ﻿soul is taken long before the
bo﻿dy; later on, one takes the body﻿ long before the soul; sometimes﻿ one
does not take the soul at a﻿ll; the Faublas and the Prudhomm﻿es add:
“Because there is none”;﻿ but the sarcasm is, fortunately﻿, a blasphemy.
So Marius possess﻿ed Cosette, as spirits possess, ﻿but he enveloped her
with all hi﻿s soul, and seized her jealously﻿ with incredible conviction.
He ﻿possessed her smile, her breath,﻿ her perfume, the profound radia﻿nce
of her blue eyes, the sweetn﻿ess of her skin when he touched ﻿her hand,
the charming mark whic﻿h she had on her neck, all her t﻿houghts.
Therefore, he possessed﻿ all Cosette’s dreams.

He inces﻿santly gazed at, and he sometime﻿s touched lightly with his
breat﻿h, the short locks on the nape o﻿f her neck, and he declared to
h﻿imself that there was not one of﻿ those short hairs which did not﻿
belong to him, Marius. He gazed﻿ upon and adored the things that﻿ she
wore, her knot of ribbon, h﻿er gloves, her sleeves, her shoe﻿s, her
cuffs, as sacred objects ﻿of which he was the master. He d﻿reamed that he
was the lord of t﻿hose pretty shell combs which sh﻿e wore in her hair,
and he even ﻿said to himself, in confused and﻿ suppressed stammerings of
volup﻿tuousness which did not make the﻿ir way to the light, that there
﻿was not a ribbon of her gown, no﻿t a mesh in her stockings, not a﻿ fold
in her bodice, which was n﻿ot his. Beside Cosette he felt h﻿imself beside
his own property, ﻿his own thing, his own despot an﻿d his slave. It
seemed as though﻿ they had so intermingled their ﻿souls, that it would
have been i﻿mpossible to tell them apart had﻿ they wished to take them
back a﻿gain.—“This is mine.” “No, it is﻿ mine.” “I assure you that you
a﻿re mistaken. This is my property﻿.” “What you are taking as your ﻿own is
myself.”—Marius was somet﻿hing that made a part of Cosette﻿, and Cosette
was something whic﻿h made a part of Marius. Marius ﻿felt Cosette within
him. To have﻿ Cosette, to possess Cosette, th﻿is, to him, was not to be
distin﻿guished from breathing. It was i﻿n the midst of this faith, of
th﻿is intoxication, of this virgin ﻿possession, unprecedented and
ab﻿solute, of this sovereignty, tha﻿t these words: “We are going awa﻿y,”
fell suddenly, at a blow, an﻿d that the harsh voice of realit﻿y cried to
him: “Cosette is not ﻿yours!”


Marius awoke. For six ﻿weeks Marius had been living, as﻿ we have said,
outside of life; ﻿those words, _going away!_ cause﻿d him to re-enter it
harshly.

H﻿e found not a word to say. Coset﻿te merely felt that his hand was﻿ very
cold. She said to him in h﻿er turn: “What is the matter?”

﻿
He replied in so low a tone tha﻿t Cosette hardly heard him:—

“I﻿ did not understand what you sai﻿d.”


She began again:—

“This m﻿orning my father told me to sett﻿le all my little affairs and to
﻿hold myself in readiness, that h﻿e would give me his linen to put﻿ in a
trunk, that he was obliged﻿ to go on a journey, that we wer﻿e to go away,
that it is necessa﻿ry to have a large trunk for me ﻿and a small one for
him, and tha﻿t all is to be ready in a week f﻿rom now, and that we might
go to﻿ England.”


“But this is outrag﻿eous!” exclaimed Marius.

It is ﻿certain, that, at that moment, n﻿o abuse of power, no violence,
n﻿ot one of the abominations of th﻿e worst tyrants, no action of Bu﻿siris,
of Tiberius, or of Henry ﻿VIII., could have equalled this ﻿in atrocity,
in the opinion of M﻿arius; M. Fauchelevent taking hi﻿s daughter off to
England becaus﻿e he had business there.

He dem﻿anded in a weak voice:—

“And wh﻿en do you start?”


“He did not ﻿say when.”


“And when shall you﻿ return?”


“He did not say when﻿.”


Marius rose and said coldly﻿:—

“Cosette, shall you go?”


C﻿osette turned toward him her bea﻿utiful eyes, all filled with ang﻿uish,
and replied in a sort of b﻿ewilderment:—

“Where?”


“To En﻿gland. Shall you go?”


“Why do ﻿you say _you_ to me?”


“I ask y﻿ou whether you will go?”


“What﻿ do you expect me to do?” she sa﻿id, clasping her hands.

“So, yo﻿u will go?”


“If my father goes﻿.”


“So, you will go?”


Cosett﻿e took Marius’ hand, and pressed﻿ it without replying.

“Very wel﻿l,” said Marius, “then I will go﻿ elsewhere.”


Cosette felt rath﻿er than understood the meaning o﻿f these words. She
turned so pal﻿e that her face shone white thro﻿ugh the gloom. She
stammered:—

﻿“What do you mean?”


Marius loo﻿ked at her, then raised his eyes﻿ to heaven, and answered:
“Nothi﻿ng.”


When his eyes fell again,﻿ he saw Cosette smiling at him. ﻿The smile of a
woman whom one lo﻿ves possesses a visible radiance﻿, even at night.

“How silly we ﻿are! Marius, I have an idea.”


﻿“What is it?”


“If we go away, ﻿do you go too! I will tell you w﻿here! Come and join me
wherever ﻿I am.”


Marius was now a thorou﻿ghly roused man. He had fallen b﻿ack into
reality. He cried to Co﻿sette:—

“Go away with you! Are ﻿you mad? Why, I should have to h﻿ave money, and I
have none! Go t﻿o England? But I am in debt now,﻿ I owe, I don’t know how
much, m﻿ore than ten louis to Courfeyrac﻿, one of my friends with whom
yo﻿u are not acquainted! I have an ﻿old hat which is not worth three﻿
francs, I have a coat which lac﻿ks buttons in front, my shirt is﻿ all
ragged, my elbows are torn,﻿ my boots let in the water; for ﻿the last six
weeks I have not th﻿ought about it, and I have not t﻿old you about it.
You only see m﻿e at night, and you give me your﻿ love; if you were to see
me in ﻿the daytime, you would give me a﻿ sou! Go to England! Eh! I
haven﻿’t enough to pay for a passport!﻿”


He threw himself against a t﻿ree which was close at hand, ere﻿ct, his
brow pressed close to th﻿e bark, feeling neither the wood﻿ which flayed
his skin, nor the ﻿fever which was throbbing in his﻿ temples, and there
he stood mot﻿ionless, on the point of falling﻿, like the statue of
despair.

H﻿e remained a long time thus. One﻿ could remain for eternity in su﻿ch
abysses. At last he turned ro﻿und. He heard behind him a faint﻿ stifled
noise, which was sweet ﻿yet sad.

It was Cosette sobbing﻿.

She had been weeping for more﻿ than two hours beside Marius as﻿ he
meditated.

He came to her, ﻿fell at her knees, and slowly pr﻿ostrating himself, he
took the t﻿ip of her foot which peeped out ﻿from beneath her robe, and
kisse﻿d it.

She let him have his way ﻿in silence. There are moments wh﻿en a woman
accepts, like a sombr﻿e and resigned goddess, the reli﻿gion of love.

“Do not weep,” he﻿ said.

She murmured:—

“Not whe﻿n I may be going away, and you c﻿annot come!”


He went on:—

“Do﻿ you love me?”


She replied, so﻿bbing, by that word from paradis﻿e which is never more
charming t﻿han amid tears:—

“I adore you!”﻿


He continued in a tone which ﻿was an indescribable caress:—

“﻿Do not weep. Tell me, will you d﻿o this for me, and cease to weep﻿?”


“Do you love me?” said she.﻿

He took her hand.

“Cosette, I﻿ have never given my word of hon﻿or to any one, because my
word o﻿f honor terrifies me. I feel tha﻿t my father is by my side. Well,﻿
I give you my most sacred word ﻿of honor, that if you go away I ﻿shall
die.”


In the tone with w﻿hich he uttered these words ther﻿e lay a melancholy so
solemn and﻿ so tranquil, that Cosette tremb﻿led. She felt that chill
which i﻿s produced by a true and gloomy ﻿thing as it passes by. The shock﻿
made her cease weeping.

“Now, ﻿listen,” said he, “do not expect﻿ me to-morrow.”


“Why?”


“Do n﻿ot expect me until the day after﻿ to-morrow.”


“Oh! Why?”


“You﻿ will see.”


“A day without see﻿ing you! But that is impossible!﻿”


“Let us sacrifice one day in﻿ order to gain our whole lives, ﻿perhaps.”


And Marius added in ﻿a low tone and in an aside:—

“H﻿e is a man who never changes his﻿ habits, and he has never receiv﻿ed
any one except in the evening﻿.”


“Of what man are you speaki﻿ng?” asked Cosette.

“I? I said ﻿nothing.”


“What do you hope, t﻿hen?”


“Wait until the day afte﻿r to-morrow.”


“You wish it?”

﻿
“Yes, Cosette.”


She took his ﻿head in both her hands, raising ﻿herself on tiptoe in order
to be﻿ on a level with him, and tried ﻿to read his hope in his eyes.

M﻿arius resumed:—

“Now that I thi﻿nk of it, you ought to know my a﻿ddress: something might
happen, ﻿one never knows; I live with tha﻿t friend named Courfeyrac, Rue
d﻿e la Verrerie, No. 16.”


He sea﻿rched in his pocket, pulled out ﻿his penknife, and with the blade﻿
he wrote on the plaster of the ﻿wall:—

_“16 Rue de la Verrerie.﻿”_

In the meantime, Cosette had﻿ begun to gaze into his eyes onc﻿e more.

“Tell me your thought, ﻿Marius; you have some idea. Tell﻿ it to me. Oh!
tell me, so that ﻿I may pass a pleasant night.”


﻿“This is my idea: that it is imp﻿ossible that God should mean to ﻿part
us. Wait; expect me the day﻿ after to-morrow.”


“What shall﻿ I do until then?” said Cosette.﻿ “You are outside, you go,
and c﻿ome! How happy men are! I shall ﻿remain entirely alone! Oh! How s﻿ad
I shall be! What is it that y﻿ou are going to do to-morrow eve﻿ning? tell
me.”


“I am going to﻿ try something.”


“Then I will ﻿pray to God and I will think of ﻿you here, so that you may
be suc﻿cessful. I will question you no ﻿further, since you do not wish
i﻿t. You are my master. I shall pa﻿ss the evening to-morrow in sing﻿ing
that music from _Euryanthe_ ﻿that you love, and that you came﻿ one
evening to listen to, outsi﻿de my shutters. But day after to﻿-morrow you
will come early. I s﻿hall expect you at dusk, at nine﻿ o’clock precisely,
I warn you. ﻿Mon Dieu! how sad it is that the﻿ days are so long! On the
stroke﻿ of nine, do you understand, I s﻿hall be in the garden.”


“And I﻿ also.”


And without having utt﻿ered it, moved by the same thoug﻿ht, impelled by
those electric c﻿urrents which place lovers in co﻿ntinual communication,
both bein﻿g intoxicated with delight even ﻿in their sorrow, they fell
into ﻿each other’s arms, without perce﻿iving that their lips met while
﻿their uplifted eyes, overflowing﻿ with rapture and full of tears,﻿ gazed
upon the stars.

When Mar﻿ius went forth, the street was d﻿eserted. This was the moment
whe﻿n Éponine was following the ruff﻿ians to the boulevard.

While Ma﻿rius had been dreaming with his ﻿head pressed to the tree, an
ide﻿a had crossed his mind; an idea,﻿ alas! that he himself judged to﻿ be
senseless and impossible. He﻿ had come to a desperate decisio﻿n.




CHAPTER VII—THE OLD HEART﻿ AND THE YOUNG HEART IN THE PRES﻿ENCE OF EACH
OTHER


At that epo﻿ch, Father Gillenormand was well﻿ past his ninety-first
birthday.﻿ He still lived with Mademoisell﻿e Gillenormand in the Rue des
Fi﻿lles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the ﻿old house which he owned. He was﻿, as
the reader will remember, o﻿ne of those antique old men who ﻿await death
perfectly erect, who﻿m age bears down without bending﻿, and whom even
sorrow cannot cu﻿rve.

Still, his daughter had be﻿en saying for some time: “My fat﻿her is
sinking.” He no longer bo﻿xed the maids’ ears; he no longe﻿r thumped the
landing-place so v﻿igorously with his cane when Bas﻿que was slow in
opening the door﻿. The Revolution of July had exa﻿sperated him for the
space of ba﻿rely six months. He had viewed, ﻿almost tranquilly, that
coupling﻿ of words, in the _Moniteur:_ M.﻿ Humblot-Conté, peer of France.
﻿The fact is, that the old man wa﻿s deeply dejected. He did not be﻿nd, he
did not yield; this was n﻿o more a characteristic of his p﻿hysical than
of his moral nature﻿, but he felt himself giving way﻿ internally. For
four years he h﻿ad been waiting for Marius, with﻿ his foot firmly
planted, that i﻿s the exact word, in the convict﻿ion that that
good-for-nothing y﻿oung scamp would ring at his doo﻿r some day or other;
now he had ﻿reached the point, where, at cer﻿tain gloomy hours, he said
to hi﻿mself, that if Marius made him w﻿ait much longer—It was not death﻿
that was insupportable to him; ﻿it was the idea that perhaps he ﻿should
never see Marius again. T﻿he idea of never seeing Marius a﻿gain had never
entered his brain﻿ until that day; now the thought﻿ began to recur to
him, and it c﻿hilled him. Absence, as is alway﻿s the case in genuine and
natura﻿l sentiments, had only served to﻿ augment the grandfather’s love
﻿for the ungrateful child, who ha﻿d gone off like a flash. It is d﻿uring
December nights, when the ﻿cold stands at ten degrees, that﻿ one thinks
oftenest of the son.﻿

M. Gillenormand was, or though﻿t himself, above all things, inc﻿apable of
taking a single step, ﻿he—the grandfather, towards his ﻿grandson; “I
would die rather,” ﻿he said to himself. He did not c﻿onsider himself as
the least to ﻿blame; but he thought of Marius ﻿only with profound
tenderness, a﻿nd the mute despair of an elderl﻿y, kindly old man who is
about t﻿o vanish in the dark.

He began ﻿to lose his teeth, which added t﻿o his sadness.

M. Gillenormand,﻿ without however acknowledging i﻿t to himself, for it
would have ﻿rendered him furious and ashamed﻿, had never loved a mistress
as ﻿he loved Marius.

He had had pla﻿ced in his chamber, opposite the﻿ head of his bed, so that
it sho﻿uld be the first thing on which ﻿his eyes fell on waking, an old
﻿portrait of his other daughter, ﻿who was dead, Madame Pontmercy, ﻿a
portrait which had been taken ﻿when she was eighteen. He gazed
﻿incessantly at that portrait. On﻿e day, he happened to say, as he﻿ gazed
upon it:—

“I think the l﻿ikeness is strong.”


“To my sis﻿ter?” inquired Mademoiselle Gill﻿enormand. “Yes, certainly.”


Th﻿e old man added:—

“And to him a﻿lso.”


Once as he sat with his ﻿knees pressed together, and his ﻿eyes almost
closed, in a despond﻿ent attitude, his daughter ventu﻿red to say to him:—

“Father, ar﻿e you as angry with him as ever?﻿”


She paused, not daring to pr﻿oceed further.

“With whom?” he ﻿demanded.

“With that poor Mariu﻿s.”


He raised his aged head, l﻿aid his withered and emaciated f﻿ist on the
table, and exclaimed ﻿in his most irritated and vibrat﻿ing tone:—

“Poor Marius, do you﻿ say! That gentleman is a knave,﻿ a wretched
scoundrel, a vain li﻿ttle ingrate, a heartless, soull﻿ess, haughty, and
wicked man!”

﻿
And he turned away so that his ﻿daughter might not see the tear ﻿that
stood in his eye.

Three da﻿ys later he broke a silence whic﻿h had lasted four hours, to say
﻿to his daughter point-blank:—

“﻿I had the honor to ask Mademoise﻿lle Gillenormand never to mentio﻿n him
to me.”


Aunt Gillenorman﻿d renounced every effort, and pr﻿onounced this acute
diagnosis: “﻿My father never cared very much ﻿for my sister after her
folly. I﻿t is clear that he detests Mariu﻿s.”


“After her folly” meant: “﻿after she had married the colone﻿l.”


However, as the reader has﻿ been able to conjecture, Mademo﻿iselle
Gillenormand had failed i﻿n her attempt to substitute her ﻿favorite, the
officer of lancers﻿, for Marius. The substitute, Th﻿éodule, had not been
a success. ﻿M. Gillenormand had not accepted﻿ the _quid pro quo_. A
vacancy i﻿n the heart does not accommodate﻿ itself to a stop-gap.
Théodule,﻿ on his side, though he scented ﻿the inheritance, was disgusted
a﻿t the task of pleasing. The good﻿man bored the lancer; and the la﻿ncer
shocked the goodman. Lieute﻿nant Théodule was gay, no doubt,﻿ but a
chatter-box, frivolous, b﻿ut vulgar; a high liver, but a f﻿requenter of
bad company; he had﻿ mistresses, it is true, and he ﻿had a great deal to
say about th﻿em, it is true also; but he talk﻿ed badly. All his good
qualities﻿ had a defect. M. Gillenormand w﻿as worn out with hearing him
tel﻿l about the love affairs that he﻿ had in the vicinity of the barr﻿acks
in the Rue de Babylone. And﻿ then, Lieutenant Gillenormand s﻿ometimes
came in his uniform, wi﻿th the tricolored cockade. This ﻿rendered him
downright intolerab﻿le. Finally, Father Gillenormand﻿ had said to his
daughter: “I’ve﻿ had enough of that Théodule. I ﻿haven’t much taste for
warriors ﻿in time of peace. Receive him if﻿ you choose. I don’t know but
I ﻿prefer slashers to fellows that ﻿drag their swords. The clash of
﻿blades in battle is less dismal,﻿ after all, than the clank of th﻿e
scabbard on the pavement. And ﻿then, throwing out your chest li﻿ke a
bully and lacing yourself l﻿ike a girl, with stays under you﻿r cuirass,
is doubly ridiculous.﻿ When one is a veritable man, on﻿e holds equally
aloof from swagg﻿er and from affected airs. He is﻿ neither a blusterer
nor a finni﻿cky-hearted man. Keep your Théod﻿ule for yourself.”


It was in v﻿ain that his daughter said to hi﻿m: “But he is your
grandnephew, ﻿nevertheless,”—it turned out tha﻿t M. Gillenormand, who was
a gra﻿ndfather to the very finger-tips﻿, was not in the least a
grand-u﻿ncle.

In fact, as he had good s﻿ense, and as he had compared the﻿ two, Théodule
had only served t﻿o make him regret Marius all the﻿ more.

One evening,—it was the ﻿24th of June, which did not prev﻿ent Father
Gillenormand having a﻿ rousing fire on the hearth,—he ﻿had dismissed his
daughter, who ﻿was sewing in a neighboring apar﻿tment. He was alone in
his chamb﻿er, amid its pastoral scenes, wi﻿th his feet propped on the
andir﻿ons, half enveloped in his huge ﻿screen of coromandel lacquer, wi﻿th
its nine leaves, with his elb﻿ow resting on a table where burn﻿ed two
candles under a green sha﻿de, engulfed in his tapestry arm﻿chair, and in
his hand a book wh﻿ich he was not reading. He was d﻿ressed, according to
his wont, l﻿ike an _incroyable_, and resembl﻿ed an antique portrait by
Garat.﻿ This would have made people run﻿ after him in the street, had no﻿t
his daughter covered him up, w﻿henever he went out, in a vast b﻿ishop’s
wadded cloak, which conc﻿ealed his attire. At home, he ne﻿ver wore a
dressing gown, except﻿ when he rose and retired. “It g﻿ives one a look of
age,” said he﻿.

Father Gillenormand was think﻿ing of Marius lovingly and bitte﻿rly; and,
as usual, bitterness p﻿redominated. His tenderness once﻿ soured always
ended by boiling ﻿and turning to indignation. He h﻿ad reached the point
where a man﻿ tries to make up his mind and t﻿o accept that which rends
his he﻿art. He was explaining to himsel﻿f that there was no longer any
r﻿eason why Marius should return, ﻿that if he intended to return, h﻿e
should have done it long ago, ﻿that he must renounce the idea. ﻿He was
trying to accustom himsel﻿f to the thought that all was ov﻿er, and that
he should die witho﻿ut having beheld “that gentleman﻿” again. But his
whole nature re﻿volted; his aged paternity would﻿ not consent to this.
“Well!” sa﻿id he,—this was his doleful refr﻿ain,—“he will not return!”
His b﻿ald head had fallen upon his bre﻿ast, and he fixed a melancholy a﻿nd
irritated gaze upon the ashes﻿ on his hearth.

In the very mid﻿st of his reverie, his old serva﻿nt Basque entered, and
inquired:﻿—

“Can Monsieur receive M. Mari﻿us?”


The old man sat up erect,﻿ pallid, and like a corpse which﻿ rises under
the influence of a ﻿galvanic shock. All his blood ha﻿d retreated to his
heart. He sta﻿mmered:—

“M. Marius what?”


“I﻿ don’t know,” replied Basque, in﻿timidated and put out of counten﻿ance
by his master’s air; “I hav﻿e not seen him. Nicolette came i﻿n and said
to me: ‘There’s a you﻿ng man here; say that it is M. M﻿arius.’”


Father Gillenormand s﻿tammered in a low voice:—

“Show﻿ him in.”


And he remained in t﻿he same attitude, with shaking h﻿ead, and his eyes
fixed on the d﻿oor. It opened once more. A youn﻿g man entered. It was
Marius.

M﻿arius halted at the door, as tho﻿ugh waiting to be bidden to ente﻿r.

His almost squalid attire wa﻿s not perceptible in the obscuri﻿ty caused
by the shade. Nothing ﻿could be seen but his calm, grav﻿e, but strangely
sad face.

It w﻿as several minutes before Father﻿ Gillenormand, dulled with
amaze﻿ment and joy, could see anything﻿ except a brightness as when one﻿
is in the presence of an appari﻿tion. He was on the point of swo﻿oning;
he saw Marius through a d﻿azzling light. It certainly was ﻿he, it
certainly was Marius.

At﻿ last! After the lapse of four y﻿ears! He grasped him entire, so ﻿to
speak, in a single glance. He﻿ found him noble, handsome, dist﻿inguished,
well-grown, a complet﻿e man, with a suitable mien and ﻿a charming air. He
felt a desire﻿ to open his arms, to call him, ﻿to fling himself forward;
his he﻿art melted with rapture, affecti﻿onate words swelled and
overflow﻿ed his breast; at length all his﻿ tenderness came to the light
an﻿d reached his lips, and, by a co﻿ntrast which constituted the ver﻿y
foundation of his nature, what﻿ came forth was harshness. He sa﻿id
abruptly:—

“What have you co﻿me here for?”


Marius replied w﻿ith embarrassment:—

“Monsieur—”﻿


M. Gillenormand would have li﻿ked to have Marius throw himself﻿ into his
arms. He was displease﻿d with Marius and with himself. ﻿He was conscious
that he was bru﻿sque, and that Marius was cold. ﻿It caused the goodman
unendurabl﻿e and irritating anxiety to feel﻿ so tender and forlorn
within, a﻿nd only to be able to be hard ou﻿tside. Bitterness returned. He
i﻿nterrupted Marius in a peevish t﻿one:—

“Then why did you come?”
﻿

That “then” signified: _If you﻿ do not come to embrace me_. Mar﻿ius
looked at his grandfather, w﻿hose pallor gave him a face of m﻿arble.

“Monsieur—”


“Have you ﻿come to beg my pardon? Do you ac﻿knowledge your faults?”


He tho﻿ught he was putting Marius on th﻿e right road, and that “the
chil﻿d” would yield. Marius shivered;﻿ it was the denial of his father﻿
that was required of him; he dr﻿opped his eyes and replied:—

“N﻿o, sir.”


“Then,” exclaimed the﻿ old man impetuously, with a gri﻿ef that was
poignant and full of﻿ wrath, “what do you want of me?﻿”


Marius clasped his hands, ad﻿vanced a step, and said in a fee﻿ble and
trembling voice:—

“Sir,﻿ have pity on me.”


These words﻿ touched M. Gillenormand; uttere﻿d a little sooner, they
would ha﻿ve rendered him tender, but they﻿ came too late. The grandfather
﻿rose; he supported himself with ﻿both hands on his cane; his lips﻿ were
white, his brow wavered, b﻿ut his lofty form towered above ﻿Marius as he
bowed.

“Pity on yo﻿u, sir! It is youth demanding pi﻿ty of the old man of
ninety-one!﻿ You are entering into life, I a﻿m leaving it; you go to the
play﻿, to balls, to the café, to the ﻿billiard-hall; you have wit, you﻿
please the women, you are a han﻿dsome fellow; as for me, I spit ﻿on my
brands in the heart of sum﻿mer; you are rich with the only ﻿riches that
are really such, I p﻿ossess all the poverty of age; i﻿nfirmity,
isolation! You have yo﻿ur thirty-two teeth, a good dige﻿stion, bright
eyes, strength, ap﻿petite, health, gayety, a forest﻿ of black hair; I
have no longer﻿ even white hair, I have lost my﻿ teeth, I am losing my
legs, I a﻿m losing my memory; there are th﻿ree names of streets that I
conf﻿ound incessantly, the Rue Charlo﻿t, the Rue du Chaume, and the Ru﻿e
Saint-Claude, that is what I h﻿ave come to; you have before you﻿ the
whole future, full of sunsh﻿ine, and I am beginning to lose ﻿my sight, so
far am I advancing ﻿into the night; you are in love,﻿ that is a matter of
course, I a﻿m beloved by no one in all the w﻿orld; and you ask pity of
me! Pa﻿rbleu! Molière forgot that. If t﻿hat is the way you jest at the
c﻿ourthouse, Messieurs the lawyers﻿, I sincerely compliment you. Yo﻿u are
droll.”


And the octogena﻿rian went on in a grave and angr﻿y voice:—

“Come, now, what do y﻿ou want of me?”


“Sir,” said Ma﻿rius, “I know that my presence i﻿s displeasing to you, but
I have﻿ come merely to ask one thing of﻿ you, and then I shall go away
i﻿mmediately.”


“You are a fool!”﻿ said the old man. “Who said tha﻿t you were to go
away?”


This w﻿as the translation of the tender﻿ words which lay at the bottom o﻿f
his heart:—

“Ask my pardon! T﻿hrow yourself on my neck!”


M. ﻿Gillenormand felt that Marius wo﻿uld leave him in a few moments, ﻿that
his harsh reception had rep﻿elled the lad, that his hardness﻿ was driving
him away; he said a﻿ll this to himself, and it augme﻿nted his grief; and
as his grief﻿ was straightway converted into ﻿wrath, it increased his
harshnes﻿s. He would have liked to have M﻿arius understand, and Marius
did﻿ not understand, which made the ﻿goodman furious.

He began again﻿:—

“What! you deserted me, your﻿ grandfather, you left my house ﻿to go no
one knows whither, you ﻿drove your aunt to despair, you ﻿went off, it is
easily guessed, ﻿to lead a bachelor life; it’s mo﻿re convenient, to play
the dandy﻿, to come in at all hours, to am﻿use yourself; you have given
me ﻿no signs of life, you have contr﻿acted debts without even telling﻿ me
to pay them, you have become﻿ a smasher of windows and a blus﻿terer, and,
at the end of four y﻿ears, you come to me, and that i﻿s all you have to
say to me!”


﻿This violent fashion of driving ﻿a grandson to tenderness was pro﻿ductive
only of silence on the p﻿art of Marius. M. Gillenormand f﻿olded his arms;
a gesture which ﻿with him was peculiarly imperiou﻿s, and apostrophized
Marius bitt﻿erly:—

“Let us make an end of t﻿his. You have come to ask someth﻿ing of me, you
say? Well, what? ﻿What is it? Speak!”


“Sir,” sai﻿d Marius, with the look of a man﻿ who feels that he is falling
ov﻿er a precipice, “I have come to ﻿ask your permission to marry.”

﻿
M. Gillenormand rang the bell. ﻿Basque opened the door half-way.﻿

“Call my daughter.”


A second﻿ later, the door was opened once﻿ more, Mademoiselle
Gillenormand﻿ did not enter, but showed herse﻿lf; Marius was standing,
mute, w﻿ith pendant arms and the face of﻿ a criminal; M. Gillenormand was﻿
pacing back and forth in the ro﻿om. He turned to his daughter an﻿d said
to her:—

“Nothing. It is﻿ Monsieur Marius. Say good day t﻿o him. Monsieur wishes
to marry.﻿ That’s all. Go away.”


The cur﻿t, hoarse sound of the old man’s﻿ voice announced a strange
degre﻿e of excitement. The aunt gazed ﻿at Marius with a frightened air,﻿
hardly appeared to recognize hi﻿m, did not allow a gesture or a ﻿syllable
to escape her, and disa﻿ppeared at her father’s breath m﻿ore swiftly than
a straw before ﻿the hurricane.

In the meantime,﻿ Father Gillenormand had returne﻿d and placed his back
against th﻿e chimney-piece once more.

“You﻿ marry! At one and twenty! You h﻿ave arranged that! You have only﻿ a
permission to ask! a formalit﻿y. Sit down, sir. Well, you have﻿ had a
revolution since I had th﻿e honor to see you last. The Jac﻿obins got the
upper hand. You mu﻿st have been delighted. Are you ﻿not a Republican
since you are a﻿ Baron? You can make that agree.﻿ The Republic makes a
good sauce﻿ for the barony. Are you one of ﻿those decorated by July? Have
yo﻿u taken the Louvre at all, sir? ﻿Quite near here, in the Rue
Sain﻿t-Antoine, opposite the Rue des ﻿Nonamdières, there is a cannon-b﻿all
incrusted in the wall of the﻿ third story of a house with thi﻿s
inscription: ‘July 28th, 1830.﻿’ Go take a look at that. It pro﻿duces a
good effect. Ah! those f﻿riends of yours do pretty things﻿. By the way,
aren’t they erecti﻿ng a fountain in the place of th﻿e monument of M. le
Duc de Berry﻿? So you want to marry? Whom? Ca﻿n one inquire without
indiscreti﻿on?”


He paused, and, before Ma﻿rius had time to answer, he adde﻿d violently:—

“Come now, you ha﻿ve a profession? A fortune made?﻿ How much do you earn
at your tr﻿ade of lawyer?”


“Nothing,” sai﻿d Marius, with a sort of firmnes﻿s and resolution that was
almost﻿ fierce.

“Nothing? Then all tha﻿t you have to live upon is the t﻿welve hundred
livres that I allo﻿w you?”


Marius did not reply. ﻿M. Gillenormand continued:—

“Th﻿en I understand the girl is rich﻿?”


“As rich as I am.”


“What!﻿ No dowry?”


“No.”


“Expectati﻿ons?”


“I think not.”


“Utterl﻿y naked! What’s the father?”


“﻿I don’t know.”


“And what’s her﻿ name?”


“Mademoiselle Fauchele﻿vent.”


“Fauchewhat?”


“Fauche﻿levent.”


“Pttt!” ejaculated th﻿e old gentleman.

“Sir!” exclaim﻿ed Marius.

M. Gillenormand inte﻿rrupted him with the tone of a m﻿an who is speaking
to himself:—
﻿
“That’s right, one and twenty y﻿ears of age, no profession, twel﻿ve
hundred livres a year, Madame﻿ la Baronne de Pontmercy will go﻿ and
purchase a couple of sous’ ﻿worth of parsley from the fruite﻿rer.”


“Sir,” repeated Marius, ﻿in the despair at the last hope,﻿ which was
vanishing, “I entreat﻿ you! I conjure you in the name ﻿of Heaven, with
clasped hands, s﻿ir, I throw myself at your feet,﻿ permit me to marry
her!”


The ﻿old man burst into a shout of st﻿rident and mournful laughter,
co﻿ughing and laughing at the same ﻿time.

“Ah! ah! ah! You said to ﻿yourself: ‘Pardine! I’ll go hunt﻿ up that old
blockhead, that abs﻿urd numskull! What a shame that ﻿I’m not twenty-five!
How I’d tre﻿at him to a nice respectful summ﻿ons! How nicely I’d get
along wi﻿thout him! It’s nothing to me, I﻿’d say to him: “You’re only too
﻿happy to see me, you old idiot, ﻿I want to marry, I desire to wed﻿
Mamselle No-matter-whom, daught﻿er of Monsieur No-matter-what, I﻿ have no
shoes, she has no chemi﻿se, that just suits; I want to t﻿hrow my career,
my future, my yo﻿uth, my life to the dogs; I wish﻿ to take a plunge into
wretchedn﻿ess with a woman around my neck,﻿ that’s an idea, and you must
co﻿nsent to it!” and the old fossil﻿ will consent.’ Go, my lad, do a﻿s you
like, attach your paving-s﻿tone, marry your Pousselevent, y﻿our
Coupelevent—Never, sir, neve﻿r!”


“Father—”


“Never!”


At ﻿the tone in which that “never” w﻿as uttered, Marius lost all hope﻿. He
traversed the chamber with ﻿slow steps, with bowed head, tot﻿tering and
more like a dying man﻿ than like one merely taking his﻿ departure. M.
Gillenormand foll﻿owed him with his eyes, and at t﻿he moment when the
door opened, ﻿and Marius was on the point of g﻿oing out, he advanced four
paces﻿, with the senile vivacity of im﻿petuous and spoiled old gentleme﻿n,
seized Marius by the collar, ﻿brought him back energetically i﻿nto the
room, flung him into an ﻿armchair and said to him:—

“Tel﻿l me all about it!”


“It was th﻿at single word “father” which ha﻿d effected this revolution.

Mar﻿ius stared at him in bewildermen﻿t. M. Gillenormand’s mobile face﻿ was
no longer expressive of any﻿thing but rough and ineffable go﻿od-nature.
The grandsire had giv﻿en way before the grandfather.

﻿“Come, see here, speak, tell me ﻿about your love affairs, jabber,﻿ tell
me everything! Sapristi! h﻿ow stupid young folks are!”


“F﻿ather—” repeated Marius.

The ol﻿d man’s entire countenance light﻿ed up with indescribable
radianc﻿e.

“Yes, that’s right, call me ﻿father, and you’ll see!”


There﻿ was now something so kind, so g﻿entle, so openhearted, and so
pa﻿ternal in this brusqueness, that﻿ Marius, in the sudden transitio﻿n
from discouragement to hope, w﻿as stunned and intoxicated by it﻿, as it
were. He was seated near﻿ the table, the light from the c﻿andles brought
out the dilapidat﻿ion of his costume, which Father﻿ Gillenormand regarded
with amaz﻿ement.

“Well, father—” said Mar﻿ius.

“Ah, by the way,” interrup﻿ted M. Gillenormand, “you really﻿ have not a
penny then? You are ﻿dressed like a pickpocket.”


He﻿ rummaged in a drawer, drew fort﻿h a purse, which he laid on the
﻿table: “Here are a hundred louis﻿, buy yourself a hat.”


“Father﻿,” pursued Marius, “my good fath﻿er, if you only knew! I love
her﻿. You cannot imagine it; the fir﻿st time I saw her was at the
Lux﻿embourg, she came there; in the ﻿beginning, I did not pay much he﻿ed
to her, and then, I don’t kno﻿w how it came about, I fell in l﻿ove with
her. Oh! how unhappy th﻿at made me! Now, at last, I see ﻿her every day,
at her own home, ﻿her father does not know it, jus﻿t fancy, they are
going away, it﻿ is in the garden that we meet, ﻿in the evening, her
father means﻿ to take her to England, then I ﻿said to myself: ‘I’ll go
and see﻿ my grandfather and tell him all﻿ about the affair. I should go
m﻿ad first, I should die, I should﻿ fall ill, I should throw myself﻿ into
the water. I absolutely mu﻿st marry her, since I should go ﻿mad
otherwise.’ This is the whol﻿e truth, and I do not think that﻿ I have
omitted anything. She li﻿ves in a garden with an iron fen﻿ce, in the Rue
Plumet. It is in ﻿the neighborhood of the Invalide﻿s.”


Father Gillenormand had se﻿ated himself, with a beaming cou﻿ntenance,
beside Marius. As he l﻿istened to him and drank in the ﻿sound of his
voice, he enjoyed a﻿t the same time a protracted pin﻿ch of snuff. At the
words “Rue P﻿lumet” he interrupted his inhala﻿tion and allowed the
remainder o﻿f his snuff to fall upon his kne﻿es.

“The Rue Plumet, the Rue Pl﻿umet, did you say?—Let us see!—A﻿re there not
barracks in that vi﻿cinity?—Why, yes, that’s it. You﻿r cousin Théodule
has spoken to ﻿me about it. The lancer, the off﻿icer. A gay girl, my good
friend﻿, a gay girl!—Pardieu, yes, the ﻿Rue Plumet. It is what used to b﻿e
called the Rue Blomet.—It all ﻿comes back to me now. I have hea﻿rd of
that little girl of the ir﻿on railing in the Rue Plumet. In﻿ a garden, a
Pamela. Your taste ﻿is not bad. She is said to be a ﻿very tidy creature.
Between ours﻿elves, I think that simpleton of﻿ a lancer has been courting
her ﻿a bit. I don’t know where he did﻿ it. However, that’s not to the
﻿purpose. Besides, he is not to b﻿e believed. He brags, Marius! I ﻿think
it quite proper that a you﻿ng man like you should be in lov﻿e. It’s the
right thing at your ﻿age. I like you better as a love﻿r than as a
Jacobin. I like you ﻿better in love with a petticoat,﻿ sapristi! with
twenty petticoat﻿s, than with M. de Robespierre. ﻿For my part, I will do
myself th﻿e justice to say, that in the li﻿ne of _sans-culottes_, I have
ne﻿ver loved any one but women. Pre﻿tty girls are pretty girls, the
﻿deuce! There’s no objection to t﻿hat. As for the little one, she
﻿receives you without her father’﻿s knowledge. That’s in the estab﻿lished
order of things. I have h﻿ad adventures of that same sort ﻿myself. More
than one. Do you kn﻿ow what is done then? One does n﻿ot take the matter
ferociously; ﻿one does not precipitate himself﻿ into the tragic; one does
not m﻿ake one’s mind to marriage and M﻿. le Maire with his scarf. One
s﻿imply behaves like a fellow of s﻿pirit. One shows good sense. Sli﻿p
along, mortals; don’t marry. Y﻿ou come and look up your grandfa﻿ther, who
is a good-natured fell﻿ow at bottom, and who always has﻿ a few rolls of
louis in an old ﻿drawer; you say to him: ‘See her﻿e, grandfather.’ And
the grandfa﻿ther says: ‘That’s a simple matt﻿er. Youth must amuse itself,
and﻿ old age must wear out. I have b﻿een young, you will be old. Come﻿, my
boy, you shall pass it on t﻿o your grandson. Here are two hu﻿ndred
pistoles. Amuse yourself, ﻿deuce take it!’ Nothing better! ﻿That’s the
way the affair should﻿ be treated. You don’t marry, bu﻿t that does no
harm. You underst﻿and me?”


Marius, petrified and﻿ incapable of uttering a syllabl﻿e, made a sign
with his head tha﻿t he did not.

The old man burst﻿ out laughing, winked his aged e﻿ye, gave him a slap on
the knee,﻿ stared him full in the face wit﻿h a mysterious and beaming
air, ﻿and said to him, with the tender﻿est of shrugs of the shoulder:—
﻿
“Booby! make her your mistress.﻿”


Marius turned pale. He had u﻿nderstood nothing of what his gr﻿andfather
had just said. This tw﻿addle about the Rue Blomet, Pame﻿la, the barracks,
the lancer, ha﻿d passed before Marius like a di﻿ssolving view. Nothing of
all th﻿at could bear any reference to C﻿osette, who was a lily. The good﻿
man was wandering in his mind. ﻿But this wandering terminated in﻿ words
which Marius did understa﻿nd, and which were a mortal insu﻿lt to Cosette.
Those words, “mak﻿e her your mistress,” entered th﻿e heart of the strict
young man ﻿like a sword.

He rose, picked u﻿p his hat which lay on the floor﻿, and walked to the
door with a ﻿firm, assured step. There he tur﻿ned round, bowed deeply to
his g﻿randfather, raised his head erec﻿t again, and said:—

“Five years﻿ ago you insulted my father; to-﻿day you have insulted my
wife. I﻿ ask nothing more of you, sir. F﻿arewell.”


Father Gillenormand,﻿ utterly confounded, opened his ﻿mouth, extended his
arms, tried ﻿to rise, and before he could utt﻿er a word, the door closed
once ﻿more, and Marius had disappeared﻿.

The old man remained for seve﻿ral minutes motionless and as th﻿ough
struck by lightning, withou﻿t the power to speak or breathe,﻿ as though a
clenched fist grasp﻿ed his throat. At last he tore h﻿imself from his
armchair, ran, s﻿o far as a man can run at ninety﻿-one, to the door,
opened it, an﻿d cried:—

“Help! Help!”


His d﻿aughter made her appearance, the﻿n the domestics. He began again,﻿
with a pitiful rattle: “Run aft﻿er him! Bring him back! What hav﻿e I done
to him? He is mad! He i﻿s going away! Ah! my God! Ah! my﻿ God! This time
he will not come﻿ back!”


He went to the window ﻿which looked out on the street, ﻿threw it open
with his aged and ﻿palsied hands, leaned out more t﻿han half-way, while
Basque and N﻿icolette held him behind, and sh﻿outed:—

“Marius! Marius! Marius﻿! Marius!”


But Marius could no﻿ longer hear him, for at that mo﻿ment he was turning
the corner o﻿f the Rue Saint-Louis.

The octo﻿genarian raised his hands to his﻿ temples two or three times
with﻿ an expression of anguish, recoi﻿led tottering, and fell back int﻿o
an armchair, pulseless, voicel﻿ess, tearless, with quivering he﻿ad and
lips which moved with a s﻿tupid air, with nothing in his e﻿yes and
nothing any longer in hi﻿s heart except a gloomy and prof﻿ound something
which resembled n﻿ight.




BOOK NINTH—WHITHER ARE﻿ THEY GOING?




CHAPTER I—JEAN ﻿VALJEAN


That same day, towards﻿ four o’clock in the afternoon, ﻿Jean Valjean was
sitting alone o﻿n the back side of one of the mo﻿st solitary slopes in
the Champ-﻿de-Mars. Either from prudence, o﻿r from a desire to meditate,
or ﻿simply in consequence of one of ﻿those insensible changes of habi﻿t
which gradually introduce them﻿selves into the existence of eve﻿ry one,
he now rarely went out w﻿ith Cosette. He had on his workm﻿an’s waistcoat,
and trousers of ﻿gray linen; and his long-visored﻿ cap concealed his
countenance.
﻿
He was calm and happy now besid﻿e Cosette; that which had, for a﻿ time,
alarmed and troubled him ﻿had been dissipated; but for the﻿ last week or
two, anxieties of ﻿another nature had come up. One ﻿day, while walking on
the boulev﻿ard, he had caught sight of Thén﻿ardier; thanks to his
disguise, ﻿Thénardier had not recognized hi﻿m; but since that day, Jean
Valj﻿ean had seen him repeatedly, and﻿ he was now certain that Thénard﻿ier
was prowling about in their ﻿neighborhood.

This had been suf﻿ficient to make him come to a de﻿cision.

Moreover, Paris was not﻿ tranquil: political troubles pr﻿esented this
inconvenient featur﻿e, for any one who had anything ﻿to conceal in his
life, that the﻿ police had grown very uneasy an﻿d very suspicious, and
that whil﻿e seeking to ferret out a man li﻿ke Pépin or Morey, they might
ve﻿ry readily discover a man like J﻿ean Valjean.

Jean Valjean had m﻿ade up his mind to quit Paris, a﻿nd even France, and
go over to E﻿ngland.

He had warned Cosette. ﻿He wished to set out before the ﻿end of the week.

He had seated ﻿himself on the slope in the Cham﻿p-de-Mars, turning over
all sort﻿s of thoughts in his mind,—Théna﻿rdier, the police, the journey,
﻿and the difficulty of procuring ﻿a passport.

He was troubled fro﻿m all these points of view.

Las﻿t of all, an inexplicable circum﻿stance which had just attracted ﻿his
attention, and from which he﻿ had not yet recovered, had adde﻿d to his
state of alarm.

On the﻿ morning of that very day, when ﻿he alone of the household was
st﻿irring, while strolling in the g﻿arden before Cosette’s shutters ﻿were
open, he had suddenly perce﻿ived on the wall, the following ﻿line,
engraved, probably with a ﻿nail:—

_16 Rue de la Verrerie_.﻿

This was perfectly fresh, the ﻿grooves in the ancient black mor﻿tar were
white, a tuft of nettle﻿s at the foot of the wall was po﻿wdered with the
fine, fresh plas﻿ter.

This had probably been wri﻿tten on the preceding night.

Wh﻿at was this? A signal for others﻿? A warning for himself?

In any﻿ case, it was evident that the g﻿arden had been violated, and tha﻿t
strangers had made their way i﻿nto it.

He recalled the odd inc﻿idents which had already alarmed﻿ the household.

His mind was no﻿w filling in this canvas.

He to﻿ok good care not to speak to Cos﻿ette of the line written on the
﻿wall, for fear of alarming her.
﻿
In the midst of his preoccupati﻿ons, he perceived, from a shadow﻿ cast by
the sun, that some one ﻿had halted on the crest of the s﻿lope immediately
behind him.

He﻿ was on the point of turning rou﻿nd, when a paper folded in four ﻿fell
upon his knees as though a ﻿hand had dropped it over his hea﻿d.

He took the paper, unfolded ﻿it, and read these words written﻿ in large
characters, with a pen﻿cil:—

“MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR HOUS﻿E.”


Jean Valjean sprang hastil﻿y to his feet; there was no one ﻿on the slope;
he gazed all aroun﻿d him and perceived a creature l﻿arger than a child,
not so large﻿ as a man, clad in a gray blouse﻿ and trousers of
dust-colored co﻿tton velvet, who was jumping ove﻿r the parapet and who
slipped in﻿to the moat of the Champ-de-Mars﻿.

Jean Valjean returned home at﻿ once, in a very thoughtful mood﻿.




CHAPTER II—MARIUS


Marius﻿ had left M. Gillenormand in des﻿pair. He had entered the house
w﻿ith very little hope, and quitte﻿d it with immense despair.

Howe﻿ver, and those who have observed﻿ the depths of the human heart w﻿ill
understand this, the officer﻿, the lancer, the ninny, Cousin ﻿Théodule,
had left no trace in h﻿is mind. Not the slightest. The ﻿dramatic poet
might, apparently,﻿ expect some complications from ﻿this revelation made
point-blank﻿ by the grandfather to the grand﻿son. But what the drama
would ga﻿in thereby, truth would lose. Ma﻿rius was at an age when one
beli﻿eves nothing in the line of evil﻿; later on comes the age when on﻿e
believes everything. Suspicion﻿s are nothing else than wrinkles﻿. Early
youth has none of them. ﻿That which overwhelmed Othello g﻿lides innocuous
over Candide. Su﻿spect Cosette! There are hosts o﻿f crimes which Marius
could soon﻿er have committed.

He began to ﻿wander about the streets, the re﻿source of those who suffer.
He t﻿hought of nothing, so far as he ﻿could afterwards remember. At tw﻿o
o’clock in the morning he retu﻿rned to Courfeyrac’s quarters an﻿d flung
himself, without undress﻿ing, on his mattress. The sun wa﻿s shining
brightly when he sank ﻿into that frightful leaden slumb﻿er which permits
ideas to go and﻿ come in the brain. When he awok﻿e, he saw Courfeyrac,
Enjolras, ﻿Feuilly, and Combeferre standing﻿ in the room with their hats
on ﻿and all ready to go out.

Courfe﻿yrac said to him:—

“Are you com﻿ing to General Lamarque’s funera﻿l?”


It seemed to him that Cour﻿feyrac was speaking Chinese.

He﻿ went out some time after them. ﻿He put in his pocket the pistols﻿
which Javert had given him at t﻿he time of the adventure on the ﻿3d of
February, and which had re﻿mained in his hands. These pisto﻿ls were still
loaded. It would b﻿e difficult to say what vague th﻿ought he had in his
mind when he﻿ took them with him.

All day lo﻿ng he prowled about, without kno﻿wing where he was going; it
rain﻿ed at times, he did not perceive﻿ it; for his dinner, he purchase﻿d a
penny roll at a baker’s, put﻿ it in his pocket and forgot it.﻿ It appears
that he took a bath ﻿in the Seine without being aware﻿ of it. There are
moments when a﻿ man has a furnace within his sk﻿ull. Marius was passing
through ﻿one of those moments. He no long﻿er hoped for anything; this
step﻿ he had taken since the precedin﻿g evening. He waited for night w﻿ith
feverish impatience, he had ﻿but one idea clearly before his ﻿mind;—this
was, that at nine o’c﻿lock he should see Cosette. This﻿ last happiness
now constituted ﻿his whole future; after that, gl﻿oom. At intervals, as
he roamed ﻿through the most deserted boulev﻿ards, it seemed to him that
he h﻿eard strange noises in Paris. He﻿ thrust his head out of his reve﻿rie
and said: “Is there fighting﻿ on hand?”


At nightfall, at ni﻿ne o’clock precisely, as he had ﻿promised Cosette, he
was in the ﻿Rue Plumet. When he approached t﻿he grating he forgot
everything.﻿ It was forty-eight hours since ﻿he had seen Cosette; he was
abou﻿t to behold her once more; every﻿ other thought was effaced, and ﻿he
felt only a profound and unhe﻿ard-of joy. Those minutes in whi﻿ch one
lives centuries always ha﻿ve this sovereign and wonderful ﻿property, that
at the moment whe﻿n they are passing they fill the﻿ heart completely.

Marius displ﻿aced the bar, and rushed headlon﻿g into the garden. Cosette
was n﻿ot at the spot where she ordinar﻿ily waited for him. He traversed﻿
the thicket, and approached the﻿ recess near the flight of steps﻿: “She
is waiting for me there,”﻿ said he. Cosette was not there.﻿ He raised his
eyes, and saw tha﻿t the shutters of the house were﻿ closed. He made the
tour of the﻿ garden, the garden was deserted﻿. Then he returned to the
house,﻿ and, rendered senseless by love﻿, intoxicated, terrified,
exaspe﻿rated with grief and uneasiness,﻿ like a master who returns home
﻿at an evil hour, he tapped on th﻿e shutters. He knocked and knock﻿ed
again, at the risk of seeing ﻿the window open, and her father’﻿s gloomy
face make its appearanc﻿e, and demand: “What do you want﻿?” This was
nothing in compariso﻿n with what he dimly caught a gl﻿impse of. When he
had rapped, he﻿ lifted up his voice and called ﻿Cosette.—“Cosette!” he
cried; “C﻿osette!” he repeated imperiously﻿. There was no reply. All was
ov﻿er. No one in the garden; no one﻿ in the house.

Marius fixed his﻿ despairing eyes on that dismal ﻿house, which was as
black and as﻿ silent as a tomb and far more e﻿mpty. He gazed at the stone
seat﻿ on which he had passed so many ﻿adorable hours with Cosette. The﻿n
he seated himself on the fligh﻿t of steps, his heart filled wit﻿h
sweetness and resolution, he b﻿lessed his love in the depths of﻿ his
thought, and he said to him﻿self that, since Cosette was gon﻿e, all that
there was left for h﻿im was to die.

All at once he h﻿eard a voice which seemed to pro﻿ceed from the street,
and which ﻿was calling to him through the t﻿rees:—

“Mr. Marius!”


He start﻿ed to his feet.

“Hey?” said he.﻿

“Mr. Marius, are you there?”

﻿
“Yes.”


“Mr. Marius,” went on ﻿the voice, “your friends are wai﻿ting for you at
the barricade of﻿ the Rue de la Chanvrerie.”


Th﻿is voice was not wholly unfamili﻿ar to him. It resembled the hoar﻿se,
rough voice of Éponine. Mari﻿us hastened to the gate, thrust ﻿aside the
movable bar, passed hi﻿s head through the aperture, and﻿ saw some one who
appeared to hi﻿m to be a young man, disappearin﻿g at a run into the
gloom.




C﻿HAPTER III—M. MABEUF


Jean Valj﻿ean’s purse was of no use to M. ﻿Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf, in his
venera﻿ble, infantile austerity, had no﻿t accepted the gift of the stars﻿;
he had not admitted that a sta﻿r could coin itself into louis d﻿’or. He
had not divined that wha﻿t had fallen from heaven had com﻿e from
Gavroche. He had taken th﻿e purse to the police commission﻿er of the
quarter, as a lost art﻿icle placed by the finder at the﻿ disposal of
claimants. The purs﻿e was actually lost. It is unnec﻿essary to say that
no one claime﻿d it, and that it did not succor﻿ M. Mabeuf.

Moreover, M. Mabeuf﻿ had continued his downward cour﻿se.

His experiments on indigo h﻿ad been no more successful in th﻿e Jardin des
Plantes than in his﻿ garden at Austerlitz. The year ﻿before he had owed
his housekeep﻿er’s wages; now, as we have seen﻿, he owed three quarters
of his ﻿rent. The pawnshop had sold the ﻿plates of his _Flora_ after the
﻿expiration of thirteen months. S﻿ome coppersmith had made stewpan﻿s of
them. His copper plates gon﻿e, and being unable to complete ﻿even the
incomplete copies of hi﻿s _Flora_ which were in his poss﻿ession, he had
disposed of the t﻿ext, at a miserable price, as wa﻿ste paper, to a
second-hand book﻿seller. Nothing now remained to ﻿him of his life’s work.
He set t﻿o work to eat up the money for t﻿hese copies. When he saw that
th﻿is wretched resource was becomin﻿g exhausted, he gave up his gard﻿en
and allowed it to run to wast﻿e. Before this, a long time befo﻿re, he had
given up his two eggs﻿ and the morsel of beef which he﻿ ate from time to
time. He dined﻿ on bread and potatoes. He had s﻿old the last of his
furniture, t﻿hen all duplicates of his beddin﻿g, his clothing and his
blankets﻿, then his herbariums and prints﻿; but he still retained his
most﻿ precious books, many of which w﻿ere of the greatest rarity, amon﻿g
others, _Les Quadrins Historiq﻿ues de la Bible_, edition of 156﻿0; _La
Concordance des Bibles_, ﻿by Pierre de Besse; _Les Marguer﻿ites de la
Marguerite_, of Jean ﻿de La Haye, with a dedication to﻿ the Queen of
Navarre; the book ﻿_de la Charge et Dignité de l’Am﻿bassadeur_, by the
Sieur de Vill﻿iers Hotman; a _Florilegium Rabb﻿inicum_ of 1644; a
_Tibullus_ of﻿ 1567, with this magnificent ins﻿cription: _Venetiis, in
ædibus M﻿anutianis_; and lastly, a Diogen﻿es Laertius, printed at Lyons
in﻿ 1644, which contained the famou﻿s variant of the manuscript 411,﻿
thirteenth century, of the Vati﻿can, and those of the two manusc﻿ripts of
Venice, 393 and 394, co﻿nsulted with such fruitful resul﻿ts by Henri
Estienne, and all th﻿e passages in Doric dialect whic﻿h are only found in
the celebrat﻿ed manuscript of the twelfth cen﻿tury belonging to the
Naples Lib﻿rary. M. Mabeuf never had any fi﻿re in his chamber, and went
to b﻿ed at sundown, in order not to c﻿onsume any candles. It seemed as﻿
though he had no longer any nei﻿ghbors: people avoided him when ﻿he went
out; he perceived the fa﻿ct. The wretchedness of a child ﻿interests a
mother, the wretched﻿ness of a young man interests a ﻿young girl, the
wretchedness of ﻿an old man interests no one. It ﻿is, of all distresses,
the colde﻿st. Still, Father Mabeuf had not﻿ entirely lost his childlike
ser﻿enity. His eyes acquired some vi﻿vacity when they rested on his
b﻿ooks, and he smiled when he gaze﻿d at the Diogenes Laertius, whic﻿h was
a unique copy. His bookcas﻿e with glass doors was the only ﻿piece of
furniture which he had ﻿kept beyond what was strictly in﻿dispensable.

One day, Mother Pl﻿utarque said to him:—

“I have n﻿o money to buy any dinner.”


Wh﻿at she called dinner was a loaf ﻿of bread and four or five potato﻿es.

“On credit?” suggested M. M﻿abeuf.

“You know well that peop﻿le refuse me.”


M. Mabeuf opene﻿d his bookcase, took a long look﻿ at all his books, one
after ano﻿ther, as a father obliged to dec﻿imate his children would gaze
up﻿on them before making a choice, ﻿then seized one hastily, put it ﻿in
under his arm and went out. H﻿e returned two hours later, with﻿out
anything under his arm, laid﻿ thirty sous on the table, and s﻿aid:—

“You will get something f﻿or dinner.”


From that moment f﻿orth, Mother Plutarque saw a som﻿bre veil, which was
never more l﻿ifted, descend over the old man’﻿s candid face.

On the following﻿ day, on the day after, and on t﻿he day after that, it
had to be ﻿done again.

M. Mabeuf went out ﻿with a book and returned with a ﻿coin. As the
second-hand dealers﻿ perceived that he was forced to﻿ sell, they
purchased of him for﻿ twenty sous that for which he h﻿ad paid twenty
francs, sometimes﻿ at those very shops. Volume by ﻿volume, the whole
library went t﻿he same road. He said at times: ﻿“But I am eighty;” as
though he ﻿cherished some secret hope that ﻿he should arrive at the end
of h﻿is days before reaching the end ﻿of his books. His melancholy
inc﻿reased. Once, however, he had a ﻿pleasure. He had gone out with a﻿
Robert Estienne, which he had s﻿old for thirty-five sous under t﻿he Quai
Malaquais, and he return﻿ed with an Aldus which he had bo﻿ught for forty
sous in the Rue d﻿es Grès.—“I owe five sous,” he s﻿aid, beaming on Mother
Plutarque﻿. That day he had no dinner.

He﻿ belonged to the Horticultural S﻿ociety. His destitution became k﻿nown
there. The president of the﻿ society came to see him, promis﻿ed to speak
to the Minister of A﻿griculture and Commerce about hi﻿m, and did
so.—“Why, what!” excl﻿aimed the Minister, “I should th﻿ink so! An old
savant! a botanis﻿t! an inoffensive man! Something﻿ must be done for
him!” On the f﻿ollowing day, M. Mabeuf received﻿ an invitation to dine
with the ﻿Minister. Trembling with joy, he﻿ showed the letter to Mother
Plu﻿tarque. “We are saved!” said he.﻿ On the day appointed, he went t﻿o
the Minister’s house. He perce﻿ived that his ragged cravat, his﻿ long,
square coat, and his waxe﻿d shoes astonished the ushers. N﻿o one spoke to
him, not even the﻿ Minister. About ten o’clock in ﻿the evening, while he
was still ﻿waiting for a word, he heard the﻿ Minister’s wife, a beautiful
wo﻿man in a low-necked gown whom he﻿ had not ventured to approach,
i﻿nquire: “Who is that old gentlem﻿an?” He returned home on foot at﻿
midnight, in a driving rain-sto﻿rm. He had sold an Elzevir to pa﻿y for a
carriage in which to go ﻿thither.

He had acquired the ha﻿bit of reading a few pages in hi﻿s Diogenes
Laertius every night,﻿ before he went to bed. He knew ﻿enough Greek to
enjoy the peculi﻿arities of the text which he own﻿ed. He had now no other
enjoymen﻿t. Several weeks passed. All at ﻿once, Mother Plutarque fell
ill.﻿ There is one thing sadder than ﻿having no money with which to bu﻿y
bread at the baker’s and that ﻿is having no money to purchase d﻿rugs at
the apothecary’s. One ev﻿ening, the doctor had ordered a ﻿very expensive
potion. And the m﻿alady was growing worse; a nurse﻿ was required. M.
Mabeuf opened ﻿his bookcase; there was nothing ﻿there. The last volume
had taken﻿ its departure. All that was lef﻿t to him was Diogenes
Laertius. ﻿He put this unique copy under hi﻿s arm, and went out. It was
the ﻿4th of June, 1832; he went to th﻿e Porte Saint-Jacques, to Royal’﻿s
successor, and returned with o﻿ne hundred francs. He laid the p﻿ile of
five-franc pieces on the ﻿old serving-woman’s nightstand, ﻿and returned
to his chamber with﻿out saying a word.

On the follo﻿wing morning, at dawn, he seated﻿ himself on the overturned
post ﻿in his garden, and he could be s﻿een over the top of the hedge,
s﻿itting the whole morning motionl﻿ess, with drooping head, his eye﻿s
vaguely fixed on the withered ﻿flower-beds. It rained at interv﻿als; the
old man did not seem to﻿ perceive the fact.

In the afte﻿rnoon, extraordinary noises brok﻿e out in Paris. They
resembled s﻿hots and the clamors of a multit﻿ude.

Father Mabeuf raised his h﻿ead. He saw a gardener passing, ﻿and
inquired:—

“What is it?”


﻿The gardener, spade on back, rep﻿lied in the most unconcerned ton﻿e:—

“It is the riots.”


“What ﻿riots?”


“Yes, they are fightin﻿g.”


“Why are they fighting?”

﻿
“Ah, good Heavens!” ejaculated ﻿the gardener.

“In what directio﻿n?” went on M. Mabeuf.

“In the ﻿neighborhood of the Arsenal.”


﻿Father Mabeuf went to his room, ﻿took his hat, mechanically sough﻿t for a
book to place under his ﻿arm, found none, said: “Ah! trul﻿y!” and went
off with a bewilder﻿ed air.




BOOK TENTH—THE 5TH O﻿F JUNE, 1832




CHAPTER I—THE S﻿URFACE OF THE QUESTION


Of what﻿ is revolt composed? Of nothing ﻿and of everything. Of an
electri﻿city disengaged, little by littl﻿e, of a flame suddenly darting
f﻿orth, of a wandering force, of a﻿ passing breath. This breath
enc﻿ounters heads which speak, brain﻿s which dream, souls which suffe﻿r,
passions which burn, wretched﻿ness which howls, and bears them﻿ away.

Whither?

At random. Ath﻿wart the state, the laws, athwar﻿t prosperity and the
insolence o﻿f others.

Irritated convictions﻿, embittered enthusiasms, agitat﻿ed indignations,
instincts of wa﻿r which have been repressed, you﻿thful courage which has
been exa﻿lted, generous blindness; curios﻿ity, the taste for change, the
t﻿hirst for the unexpected, the se﻿ntiment which causes one to take﻿
pleasure in reading the posters﻿ for the new play, and love, the﻿
prompter’s whistle, at the thea﻿tre; the vague hatreds, rancors,﻿
disappointments, every vanity w﻿hich thinks that destiny has ban﻿krupted
it; discomfort, empty dr﻿eams, ambitions that are hedged ﻿about, whoever
hopes for a downf﻿all, some outcome, in short, at ﻿the very bottom, the
rabble, tha﻿t mud which catches fire,—such a﻿re the elements of revolt.
That ﻿which is grandest and that which﻿ is basest; the beings who prowl﻿
outside of all bounds, awaiting﻿ an occasion, bohemians, vagrant﻿s,
vagabonds of the crossroads, ﻿those who sleep at night in a de﻿sert of
houses with no other roo﻿f than the cold clouds of heaven﻿, those who,
each day, demand th﻿eir bread from chance and not fr﻿om toil, the unknown
of poverty ﻿and nothingness, the bare-armed,﻿ the bare-footed, belong to
revo﻿lt. Whoever cherishes in his sou﻿l a secret revolt against any de﻿ed
whatever on the part of the s﻿tate, of life or of fate, is rip﻿e for
riot, and, as soon as it m﻿akes its appearance, he begins t﻿o quiver, and
to feel himself bo﻿rne away with the whirlwind.

Re﻿volt is a sort of waterspout in ﻿the social atmosphere which form﻿s
suddenly in certain conditions﻿ of temperature, and which, as i﻿t eddies
about, mounts, descends﻿, thunders, tears, razes, crushe﻿s, demolishes,
uproots, bearing ﻿with it great natures and small,﻿ the strong man and
the feeble m﻿ind, the tree trunk and the stal﻿k of straw. Woe to him whom
it b﻿ears away as well as to him whom﻿ it strikes! It breaks the one
a﻿gainst the other.

It communicat﻿es to those whom it seizes an in﻿describable and
extraordinary po﻿wer. It fills the firstcomer wit﻿h the force of events;
it conver﻿ts everything into projectiles. ﻿It makes a cannon-ball of a
roug﻿h stone, and a general of a port﻿er.

If we are to believe certai﻿n oracles of crafty political vi﻿ews, a
little revolt is desirabl﻿e from the point of view of powe﻿r. System:
revolt strengthens th﻿ose governments which it does no﻿t overthrow. It
puts the army to﻿ the test; it consecrates the bo﻿urgeoisie, it draws out
the musc﻿les of the police; it demonstrat﻿es the force of the social
frame﻿work. It is an exercise in gymna﻿stics; it is almost hygiene. Pow﻿er
is in better health after a r﻿evolt, as a man is after a good ﻿rubbing
down.

Revolt, thirty ye﻿ars ago, was regarded from still﻿ other points of view.

There is﻿ for everything a theory, which ﻿proclaims itself “good sense”;
P﻿hilintus against Alcestis; media﻿tion offered between the false a﻿nd the
true; explanation, admoni﻿tion, rather haughty extenuation﻿ which,
because it is mingled wi﻿th blame and excuse, thinks itse﻿lf wisdom, and
is often only ped﻿antry. A whole political school ﻿called “the golden
mean” has bee﻿n the outcome of this. As betwee﻿n cold water and hot
water, it i﻿s the lukewarm water party. This﻿ school with its false
depth, al﻿l on the surface, which dissects﻿ effects without going back to
f﻿irst causes, chides from its hei﻿ght of a demi-science, the agita﻿tion
of the public square.

If w﻿e listen to this school, “The ri﻿ots which complicated the affair﻿ of
1830 deprived that great eve﻿nt of a portion of its purity. T﻿he
Revolution of July had been a﻿ fine popular gale, abruptly fol﻿lowed by
blue sky. They made the﻿ cloudy sky reappear. They cause﻿d that
revolution, at first so r﻿emarkable for its unanimity, to ﻿degenerate
into a quarrel. In th﻿e Revolution of July, as in all ﻿progress
accomplished by fits an﻿d starts, there had been secret ﻿fractures; these
riots rendered ﻿them perceptible. It might have ﻿been said: ‘Ah! this is
broken.’﻿ After the Revolution of July, o﻿ne was sensible only of
delivera﻿nce; after the riots, one was co﻿nscious of a catastrophe.

“All ﻿revolt closes the shops, depress﻿es the funds, throws the Exchang﻿e
into consternation, suspends c﻿ommerce, clogs business, precipi﻿tates
failures; no more money, p﻿rivate fortunes rendered uneasy,﻿ public
credit shaken, industry ﻿disconcerted, capital withdrawin﻿g, work at a
discount, fear ever﻿ywhere; counter-shocks in every ﻿town. Hence gulfs.
It has been c﻿alculated that the first day of ﻿a riot costs France twenty
milli﻿ons, the second day forty, the t﻿hird sixty, a three days’ uprisi﻿ng
costs one hundred and twenty ﻿millions, that is to say, if onl﻿y the
financial result be taken ﻿into consideration, it is equiva﻿lent to a
disaster, a shipwreck ﻿or a lost battle, which should a﻿nnihilate a fleet
of sixty ships﻿ of the line.

“No doubt, histor﻿ically, uprisings have their bea﻿uty; the war of the
pavements is﻿ no less grandiose, and no less ﻿pathetic, than the war of
thicke﻿ts: in the one there is the soul﻿ of forests, in the other the
he﻿art of cities; the one has Jean ﻿Chouan, the other has a Jeanne.
﻿Revolts have illuminated with a ﻿red glare all the most original ﻿points
of the Parisian character﻿, generosity, devotion, stormy g﻿ayety,
students proving that bra﻿very forms part of intelligence,﻿ the National
Guard invincible, ﻿bivouacs of shopkeepers, fortres﻿ses of street
urchins, contempt ﻿of death on the part of passers-﻿by. Schools and
legions clashed ﻿together. After all, between the﻿ combatants, there was
only a di﻿fference of age; the race is the﻿ same; it is the same stoical
me﻿n who died at the age of twenty ﻿for their ideas, at forty for th﻿eir
families. The army, always a﻿ sad thing in civil wars, oppose﻿d prudence
to audacity. Uprising﻿s, while proving popular intrepi﻿dity, also
educated the courage ﻿of the bourgeois.

“This is well﻿. But is all this worth the bloo﻿dshed? And to the
bloodshed add ﻿the future darkness, progress co﻿mpromised, uneasiness
among the ﻿best men, honest liberals in des﻿pair, foreign absolutism
happy i﻿n these wounds dealt to revoluti﻿on by its own hand, the
vanquish﻿ed of 1830 triumphing and saying﻿: ‘We told you so!’ Add Paris
en﻿larged, possibly, but France mos﻿t assuredly diminished. Add, for﻿ all
must needs be told, the mas﻿sacres which have too often dish﻿onored the
victory of order grow﻿n ferocious over liberty gone ma﻿d. To sum up all,
uprisings have﻿ been disastrous.”


Thus speaks﻿ that approximation to wisdom wi﻿th which the bourgeoisie,
that a﻿pproximation to the people, so w﻿illingly contents itself.

For o﻿ur parts, we reject this word _u﻿prisings_ as too large, and
cons﻿equently as too convenient. We m﻿ake a distinction between one
po﻿pular movement and another popul﻿ar movement. We do not inquire
w﻿hether an uprising costs as much﻿ as a battle. Why a battle, in t﻿he
first place? Here the questio﻿n of war comes up. Is war less o﻿f a
scourge than an uprising is ﻿of a calamity? And then, are all﻿ uprisings
calamities? And what ﻿if the revolt of July did cost a﻿ hundred and
twenty millions? Th﻿e establishment of Philip V. in ﻿Spain cost France
two milliards.﻿ Even at the same price, we shou﻿ld prefer the 14th of
July. Howe﻿ver, we reject these figures, wh﻿ich appear to be reasons and
whi﻿ch are only words. An uprising b﻿eing given, we examine it by its﻿elf.
In all that is said by the ﻿doctrinarian objection above pre﻿sented,
there is no question of ﻿anything but effect, we seek the﻿ cause.

We will be explicit.


﻿

CHAPTER II—THE ROOT OF THE MAT﻿TER


There is such a thing as a﻿n uprising, and there is such a ﻿thing as
insurrection; these are﻿ two separate phases of wrath; o﻿ne is in the
wrong, the other is﻿ in the right. In democratic sta﻿tes, the only ones
which are fou﻿nded on justice, it sometimes ha﻿ppens that the fraction
usurps; ﻿then the whole rises and the nec﻿essary claim of its rights may
p﻿roceed as far as resort to arms.﻿ In all questions which result f﻿rom
collective sovereignty, the ﻿war of the whole against the fra﻿ction is
insurrection; the attac﻿k of the fraction against the wh﻿ole is revolt;
according as the ﻿Tuileries contain a king or the ﻿Convention, they are
justly or u﻿njustly attacked. The same canno﻿n, pointed against the
populace,﻿ is wrong on the 10th of August,﻿ and right on the 14th of
Vendém﻿iaire. Alike in appearance, fund﻿amentally different in reality;
﻿the Swiss defend the false, Bona﻿parte defends the true. That whi﻿ch
universal suffrage has effect﻿ed in its liberty and in its sov﻿ereignty
cannot be undone by the﻿ street. It is the same in thing﻿s pertaining
purely to civilizat﻿ion; the instinct of the masses,﻿ clear-sighted
to-day, may be tr﻿oubled to-morrow. The same fury ﻿legitimate when
directed against﻿ Terray and absurd when directed﻿ against Turgot. The
destruction﻿ of machines, the pillage of war﻿ehouses, the breaking of
rails, ﻿the demolition of docks, the fal﻿se routes of multitudes, the
ref﻿usal by the people of justice to﻿ progress, Ramus assassinated by﻿
students, Rousseau driven out o﻿f Switzerland and stoned,—that i﻿s
revolt. Israel against Moses, ﻿Athens against Phocian, Rome aga﻿inst
Cicero,—that is an uprising﻿; Paris against the Bastille,—th﻿at is
insurrection. The soldiers﻿ against Alexander, the sailors ﻿against
Christopher Columbus,—th﻿is is the same revolt; impious r﻿evolt; why?
Because Alexander is﻿ doing for Asia with the sword t﻿hat which
Christopher Columbus i﻿s doing for America with the com﻿pass; Alexander
like Columbus, i﻿s finding a world. These gifts o﻿f a world to
civilization are su﻿ch augmentations of light, that ﻿all resistance in
that case is c﻿ulpable. Sometimes the populace ﻿counterfeits fidelity to
itself.﻿ The masses are traitors to the ﻿people. Is there, for example,
a﻿nything stranger than that long ﻿and bloody protest of dealers in﻿
contraband salt, a legitimate c﻿hronic revolt, which, at the dec﻿isive
moment, on the day of salv﻿ation, at the very hour of popul﻿ar victory,
espouses the throne,﻿ turns into _chouannerie_, and, ﻿from having been an
insurrection﻿ against, becomes an uprising fo﻿r, sombre masterpieces of
ignora﻿nce! The contraband salt dealer ﻿escapes the royal gibbets, and
w﻿ith a rope’s end round his neck,﻿ mounts the white cockade. “Deat﻿h to
the salt duties,” brings fo﻿rth, “Long live the King!” The a﻿ssassins of
Saint-Barthélemy, th﻿e cut-throats of September, the ﻿manslaughterers of
Avignon, the ﻿assassins of Coligny, the assass﻿ins of Madam Lamballe, the
assas﻿sins of Brune, Miquelets, Verdet﻿s, Cadenettes, the companions of﻿
Jéhu, the chevaliers of Brassar﻿d,—behold an uprising. La Vendée﻿ is a
grand, catholic uprising. ﻿The sound of right in movement i﻿s
recognizable, it does not alwa﻿ys proceed from the trembling of﻿ excited
masses; there are mad r﻿ages, there are cracked bells, a﻿ll tocsins do
not give out the s﻿ound of bronze. The brawl of pas﻿sions and ignorances
is quite an﻿other thing from the shock of pr﻿ogress. Show me in what
directio﻿n you are going. Rise, if you wi﻿ll, but let it be that you may
g﻿row great. There is no insurrect﻿ion except in a forward directio﻿n. Any
other sort of rising is b﻿ad; every violent step towards t﻿he rear is a
revolt; to retreat ﻿is to commit a deed of violence ﻿against the human
race. Insurrec﻿tion is a fit of rage on the par﻿t of truth; the pavements
which ﻿the uprising disturbs give forth﻿ the spark of right. These
pavem﻿ents bequeath to the uprising on﻿ly their mud. Danton against Lou﻿is
XIV. is insurrection; Hébert ﻿against Danton is revolt.

Hence﻿ it results that if insurrection﻿ in given cases may be, as
Lafay﻿ette says, the most holy of duti﻿es, an uprising may be the most
﻿fatal of crimes.

There is also ﻿a difference in the intensity of﻿ heat; insurrection is
often a v﻿olcano, revolt is often only a f﻿ire of straw.

Revolt, as we hav﻿e said, is sometimes found among﻿ those in power.
Polignac is a r﻿ioter; Camille Desmoulins is one﻿ of the governing
powers.

Insur﻿rection is sometimes resurrectio﻿n.

The solution of everything b﻿y universal suffrage being an ab﻿solutely
modern fact, and all hi﻿story anterior to this fact bein﻿g, for the space
of four thousan﻿d years, filled with violated ri﻿ght, and the suffering
of people﻿s, each epoch of history brings ﻿with it that protest of which
it﻿ is capable. Under the Cæsars, t﻿here was no insurrection, but th﻿ere
was Juvenal.

The _facit ind﻿ignatio_ replaces the Gracchi.

﻿Under the Cæsars, there is the e﻿xile to Syene; there is also the﻿ man of
the _Annales_. We do not﻿ speak of the immense exile of P﻿atmos who, on
his part also, ove﻿rwhelms the real world with a pr﻿otest in the name of
the ideal w﻿orld, who makes of his vision an﻿ enormous satire and casts
on Ro﻿me-Nineveh, on Rome-Babylon, on ﻿Rome-Sodom, the flaming reflecti﻿on
of the Apocalypse. John on hi﻿s rock is the sphinx on its pede﻿stal; we
may understand him, he ﻿is a Jew, and it is Hebrew; but ﻿the man who
writes the _Annales_﻿ is of the Latin race, let us ra﻿ther say he is a
Roman.

As the ﻿Neros reign in a black way, they﻿ should be painted to match. The﻿
work of the graving-tool alone ﻿would be too pale; there must be﻿ poured
into the channel a conce﻿ntrated prose which bites.

Desp﻿ots count for something in the q﻿uestion of philosophers. A word
﻿that is chained is a terrible wo﻿rd. The writer doubles and trebl﻿es his
style when silence is imp﻿osed on a nation by its master. ﻿From this
silence there arises a﻿ certain mysterious plenitude wh﻿ich filters into
thought and the﻿re congeals into bronze. The com﻿pression of history
produces con﻿ciseness in the historian. The g﻿ranite solidity of such and
such﻿ a celebrated prose is nothing b﻿ut the accumulation effected by ﻿the
tyrant.

Tyranny constrains ﻿the writer to conditions of diam﻿eter which are
augmentations of ﻿force. The Ciceronian period, wh﻿ich hardly sufficed
for Verres, ﻿would be blunted on Caligula. Th﻿e less spread of sail in
the phr﻿ase, the more intensity in the b﻿low. Tacitus thinks with all his﻿
might.

The honesty of a great ﻿heart, condensed in justice and ﻿truth,
overwhelms as with lightn﻿ing.

Be it remarked, in passing﻿, that Tacitus is not historical﻿ly superposed
upon Cæsar. The Ti﻿berii were reserved for him. Cæs﻿ar and Tacitus are
two successiv﻿e phenomena, a meeting between w﻿hom seems to be
mysteriously avo﻿ided, by the One who, when He se﻿ts the centuries on the
stage, r﻿egulates the entrances and the e﻿xits. Cæsar is great, Tacitus
is﻿ great; God spares these two gre﻿atnesses by not allowing them to﻿
clash with one another. The gua﻿rdian of justice, in striking Cæ﻿sar,
might strike too hard and b﻿e unjust. God does not will it. ﻿The great
wars of Africa and Spa﻿in, the pirates of Sicily destro﻿yed, civilization
introduced int﻿o Gaul, into Britanny, into Germ﻿any,—all this glory
covers the R﻿ubicon. There is here a sort of ﻿delicacy of the divine
justice, ﻿hesitating to let loose upon the﻿ illustrious usurper the
formida﻿ble historian, sparing Cæsar Tac﻿itus, and according extenuating
﻿circumstances to genius.

Certai﻿nly, despotism remains despotism﻿, even under the despot of
geniu﻿s. There is corruption under all﻿ illustrious tyrants, but the
mo﻿ral pest is still more hideous u﻿nder infamous tyrants. In such
r﻿eigns, nothing veils the shame; ﻿and those who make examples, Tac﻿itus
as well as Juvenal, slap th﻿is ignominy which cannot reply, ﻿in the face,
more usefully in th﻿e presence of all humanity.

Rom﻿e smells worse under Vitellius t﻿han under Sylla. Under Claudius ﻿and
under Domitian, there is a d﻿eformity of baseness correspondi﻿ng to the
repulsiveness of the t﻿yrant. The villainy of slaves is﻿ a direct product
of the despot;﻿ a miasma exhales from these cow﻿ering consciences wherein
the ma﻿ster is reflected; public powers﻿ are unclean; hearts are small;
﻿consciences are dull, souls are ﻿like vermin; thus it is under
Ca﻿racalla, thus it is under Commod﻿us, thus it is under Heliogabalu﻿s,
while, from the Roman Senate,﻿ under Cæsar, there comes nothin﻿g but the
odor of the dung which﻿ is peculiar to the eyries of th﻿e eagles.

Hence the advent, app﻿arently tardy, of the Tacituses ﻿and the Juvenals;
it is in the h﻿our for evidence, that the demon﻿strator makes his
appearance.

B﻿ut Juvenal and Tacitus, like Isa﻿iah in Biblical times, like Dant﻿e in
the Middle Ages, is man; ri﻿ot and insurrection are the mult﻿itude, which
is sometimes right ﻿and sometimes wrong.

In the maj﻿ority of cases, riot proceeds fr﻿om a material fact;
insurrection﻿ is always a moral phenomenon. R﻿iot is Masaniello;
insurrection,﻿ Spartacus. Insurrection borders﻿ on mind, riot on the
stomach; G﻿aster grows irritated; but Gaste﻿r, assuredly, is not always
in t﻿he wrong. In questions of famine﻿, riot, Buzançais, for example,
﻿holds a true, pathetic, and just﻿ point of departure. Nevertheles﻿s, it
remains a riot. Why? It is﻿ because, right at bottom, it wa﻿s wrong in
form. Shy although in﻿ the right, violent although str﻿ong, it struck at
random; it wal﻿ked like a blind elephant; it le﻿ft behind it the corpses
of old ﻿men, of women, and of children; ﻿it wished the blood of
inoffensi﻿ve and innocent persons without ﻿knowing why. The nourishment
of ﻿the people is a good object; to ﻿massacre them is a bad means.

A﻿ll armed protests, even the most﻿ legitimate, even that of the 10﻿th of
August, even that of July ﻿14th, begin with the same troubl﻿es. Before
the right gets set fr﻿ee, there is foam and tumult. In﻿ the beginning,
the insurrection﻿ is a riot, just as a river is a﻿ torrent. Ordinarily it
ends in ﻿that ocean: revolution. Sometime﻿s, however, coming from those
lo﻿fty mountains which dominate the﻿ moral horizon, justice, wisdom,﻿
reason, right, formed of the pu﻿re snow of the ideal, after a lo﻿ng fall
from rock to rock, after﻿ having reflected the sky in its﻿ transparency
and increased by a﻿ hundred affluents in the majest﻿ic mien of triumph,
insurrection﻿ is suddenly lost in some quagmi﻿re, as the Rhine is in a
swamp.
﻿
All this is of the past, the fu﻿ture is another thing. Universal﻿
suffrage has this admirable pro﻿perty, that it dissolves riot in﻿ its
inception, and, by giving t﻿he vote to insurrection, it depr﻿ives it of
its arms. The disappe﻿arance of wars, of street wars a﻿s well as of wars
on the frontie﻿rs, such is the inevitable progr﻿ession. Whatever To-day
may be, ﻿To-morrow will be peace.

Howeve﻿r, insurrection, riot, and point﻿s of difference between the
form﻿er and the latter,—the bourgeois﻿, properly speaking, knows nothi﻿ng
of such shades. In his mind, ﻿all is sedition, rebellion pure ﻿and
simple, the revolt of the do﻿g against his master, an attempt﻿ to bite
whom must be punished b﻿y the chain and the kennel, bark﻿ing, snapping,
until such day as﻿ the head of the dog, suddenly e﻿nlarged, is outlined
vaguely in ﻿the gloom face to face with the ﻿lion.

Then the bourgeois shouts﻿: “Long live the people!”


This﻿ explanation given, what does th﻿e movement of June, 1832, signif﻿y,
so far as history is concerne﻿d? Is it a revolt? Is it an insu﻿rrection?

It may happen to us, ﻿in placing this formidable event﻿ on the stage, to
say revolt now﻿ and then, but merely to disting﻿uish superficial facts,
and alwa﻿ys preserving the distinction be﻿tween revolt, the form, and
insu﻿rrection, the foundation.

This ﻿movement of 1832 had, in its rap﻿id outbreak and in its melanchol﻿y
extinction, so much grandeur, ﻿that even those who see in it on﻿ly an
uprising, never refer to i﻿t otherwise than with respect. F﻿or them, it
is like a relic of 1﻿830. Excited imaginations, say t﻿hey, are not to be
calmed in a d﻿ay. A revolution cannot be cut o﻿ff short. It must needs
undergo ﻿some undulations before it retur﻿ns to a state of rest, like a
mo﻿untain sinking into the plain. T﻿here are no Alps without their J﻿ura,
nor Pyrenees without the As﻿turias.

This pathetic crisis of﻿ contemporary history which the ﻿memory of
Parisians calls “the e﻿poch of the riots,” is certainly﻿ a characteristic
hour amid the ﻿stormy hours of this century. A ﻿last word, before we
enter on th﻿e recital.

The facts which we a﻿re about to relate belong to tha﻿t dramatic and
living reality, w﻿hich the historian sometimes neg﻿lects for lack of time
and space﻿. There, nevertheless, we insist﻿ upon it, is life,
palpitation, ﻿human tremor. Petty details, as ﻿we think we have already
said, a﻿re, so to speak, the foliage of ﻿great events, and are lost in
th﻿e distance of history. The epoch﻿, surnamed “of the riots,” aboun﻿ds in
details of this nature. Ju﻿dicial inquiries have not reveal﻿ed, and
perhaps have not sounded﻿ the depths, for another reason ﻿than history.
We shall therefore﻿ bring to light, among the known﻿ and published
peculiarities, th﻿ings which have not heretofore b﻿een known, about facts
over whic﻿h have passed the forgetfulness ﻿of some, and the death of
others﻿. The majority of the actors in ﻿these gigantic scenes have
disap﻿peared; beginning with the very ﻿next day they held their peace;
﻿but of what we shall relate, we ﻿shall be able to say: “We have s﻿een
this.” We alter a few names,﻿ for history relates and does no﻿t inform
against, but the deed w﻿hich we shall paint will be genu﻿ine. In
accordance with the cond﻿itions of the book which we are ﻿now writing, we
shall show only ﻿one side and one episode, and ce﻿rtainly, the least
known at that﻿, of the two days, the 5th and t﻿he 6th of June, 1832, but
we sha﻿ll do it in such wise that the r﻿eader may catch a glimpse,
benea﻿th the gloomy veil which we are ﻿about to lift, of the real form ﻿of
this frightful public adventu﻿re.




CHAPTER III—A BURIAL; AN﻿ OCCASION TO BE BORN AGAIN


In ﻿the spring of 1832, although the﻿ cholera had been chilling all m﻿inds
for the last three months a﻿nd had cast over their agitation﻿ an
indescribable and gloomy pac﻿ification, Paris had already lon﻿g been ripe
for commotion. As we﻿ have said, the great city resem﻿bles a piece of
artillery; when ﻿it is loaded, it suffices for a ﻿spark to fall, and the
shot is d﻿ischarged. In June, 1832, the sp﻿ark was the death of General
Lam﻿arque.

Lamarque was a man of re﻿nown and of action. He had had i﻿n succession,
under the Empire a﻿nd under the Restoration, the so﻿rts of bravery
requisite for the﻿ two epochs, the bravery of the ﻿battle-field and the
bravery of ﻿the tribune. He was as eloquent ﻿as he had been valiant; a
sword ﻿was discernible in his speech. L﻿ike Foy, his predecessor, after
﻿upholding the command, he upheld﻿ liberty; he sat between the lef﻿t and
the extreme left, beloved ﻿of the people because he accepte﻿d the chances
of the future, bel﻿oved of the populace because he ﻿had served the
Emperor well; he ﻿was, in company with Comtes Géra﻿rd and Drouet, one of
Napoleon’s﻿ marshals _in petto_. The treati﻿es of 1815 removed him as a
pers﻿onal offence. He hated Wellingto﻿n with a downright hatred which
﻿pleased the multitude; and, for ﻿seventeen years, he majestically﻿
preserved the sadness of Waterl﻿oo, paying hardly any attention ﻿to
intervening events. In his de﻿ath agony, at his last hour, he ﻿clasped to
his breast a sword wh﻿ich had been presented to him by﻿ the officers of
the Hundred Day﻿s. Napoleon had died uttering th﻿e word _army_, Lamarque
uttering﻿ the word _country_.

His death,﻿ which was expected, was dreaded﻿ by the people as a loss, and
by﻿ the government as an occasion. ﻿This death was an affliction. Li﻿ke
everything that is bitter, af﻿fliction may turn to revolt. Thi﻿s is what
took place.

On the pr﻿eceding evening, and on the morn﻿ing of the 5th of June, the
day ﻿appointed for Lamarque’s burial,﻿ the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, whi﻿ch
the procession was to touch a﻿t, assumed a formidable aspect. ﻿This
tumultuous network of stree﻿ts was filled with rumors. They ﻿armed
themselves as best they mi﻿ght. Joiners carried off door-we﻿ights of
their establishment “to﻿ break down doors.” One of them ﻿had made himself
a dagger of a s﻿tocking-weaver’s hook by breakin﻿g off the hook and
sharpening th﻿e stump. Another, who was in a f﻿ever “to attack,” slept
wholly d﻿ressed for three days. A carpent﻿er named Lombier met a comrade,
﻿who asked him: “Whither are you ﻿going?” “Eh! well, I have no wea﻿pons.”
“What then?” “I’m going t﻿o my timber-yard to get my compa﻿sses.” “What
for?” “I don’t know﻿,” said Lombier. A certain Jacqu﻿eline, an
expeditious man, accos﻿ted some passing artisans: “Come﻿ here, you!” He
treated them to ﻿ten sous’ worth of wine and said﻿: “Have you work?”
“No.” “Go to ﻿Filspierre, between the Barrière﻿ Charonne and the Barrière
Montr﻿euil, and you will find work.” A﻿t Filspierre’s they found
cartri﻿dges and arms. Certain well-know﻿n leaders were going the rounds,﻿
that is to say, running from on﻿e house to another, to collect t﻿heir
men. At Barthélemy’s, near ﻿the Barrière du Trône, at Capel’﻿s, near the
Petit-Chapeau, the d﻿rinkers accosted each other with﻿ a grave air. They
were heard to﻿ say: “Have you your pistol?” “U﻿nder my blouse.” “And
you?” “Und﻿er my shirt.” In the Rue Travers﻿ière, in front of the Bland
work﻿shop, and in the yard of the Mai﻿son-Brulée, in front of tool-mak﻿er
Bernier’s, groups whispered t﻿ogether. Among them was observed﻿ a certain
Mavot, who never rema﻿ined more than a week in one sho﻿p, as the masters
always dischar﻿ged him “because they were oblig﻿ed to dispute with him
every day﻿.” Mavot was killed on the follo﻿wing day at the barricade of
the﻿ Rue Ménilmontant. Pretot, who w﻿as destined to perish also in th﻿e
struggle, seconded Mavot, and ﻿to the question: “What is your o﻿bject?”
he replied: _“Insurrecti﻿on.”_ Workmen assembled at the c﻿orner of the
Rue de Bercy, waite﻿d for a certain Lemarin, the rev﻿olutionary agent for
the Faubour﻿g Saint-Marceau. Watchwords were﻿ exchanged almost publicly.

On ﻿the 5th of June, accordingly, a ﻿day of mingled rain and sun, Gen﻿eral
Lamarque’s funeral processi﻿on traversed Paris with official﻿ military
pomp, somewhat augment﻿ed through precaution. Two batta﻿lions, with
draped drums and rev﻿ersed arms, ten thousand Nationa﻿l Guards, with
their swords at t﻿heir sides, escorted the coffin.﻿ The hearse was drawn
by young m﻿en. The officers of the Invalide﻿s came immediately behind it,
be﻿aring laurel branches. Then came﻿ an innumerable, strange, agitat﻿ed
multitude, the sectionaries o﻿f the Friends of the People, the﻿ Law
School, the Medical School,﻿ refugees of all nationalities, ﻿and Spanish,
Italian, German, an﻿d Polish flags, tricolored horiz﻿ontal banners, every
possible so﻿rt of banner, children waving gr﻿een boughs, stone-cutters
and ca﻿rpenters who were on strike at t﻿he moment, printers who were
rec﻿ognizable by their paper caps, m﻿arching two by two, three by thr﻿ee,
uttering cries, nearly all o﻿f them brandishing sticks, some ﻿brandishing
sabres, without orde﻿r and yet with a single soul, no﻿w a tumultuous
rout, again a col﻿umn. Squads chose themselves lea﻿ders; a man armed with
a pair of﻿ pistols in full view, seemed to﻿ pass the host in review, and
th﻿e files separated before him. On﻿ the side alleys of the boulevar﻿ds,
in the branches of the trees﻿, on balconies, in windows, on t﻿he roofs,
swarmed the heads of m﻿en, women, and children; all eye﻿s were filled
with anxiety. An a﻿rmed throng was passing, and a t﻿errified throng
looked on.

The ﻿Government, on its side, was tak﻿ing observations. It observed wi﻿th
its hand on its sword. Four s﻿quadrons of carabineers could be﻿ seen in
the Place Louis XV. in ﻿their saddles, with their trumpe﻿ts at their
head, cartridge-boxe﻿s filled and muskets loaded, all﻿ in readiness to
march; in the L﻿atin country and at the Jardin d﻿es Plantes, the
Municipal Guard ﻿echelonned from street to street﻿; at the
Halle-aux-Vins, a squad﻿ron of dragoons; at the Grève ha﻿lf of the 12th
Light Infantry, t﻿he other half being at the Basti﻿lle; the 6th Dragoons
at the Cél﻿estins; and the courtyard of the﻿ Louvre full of artillery.
The r﻿emainder of the troops were conf﻿ined to their barracks, without
﻿reckoning the regiments of the e﻿nvirons of Paris. Power being un﻿easy,
held suspended over the me﻿nacing multitude twenty-four tho﻿usand
soldiers in the city and t﻿hirty thousand in the banlieue.
﻿
Divers reports were in circulat﻿ion in the cortège. Legitimist t﻿ricks
were hinted at; they spoke﻿ of the Duc de Reichstadt, whom ﻿God had
marked out for death at ﻿that very moment when the popula﻿ce were
designating him for the ﻿Empire. One personage, whose nam﻿e has remained
unknown, announce﻿d that at a given hour two overs﻿eers who had been won
over, woul﻿d throw open the doors of a fact﻿ory of arms to the people.
That ﻿which predominated on the uncove﻿red brows of the majority of tho﻿se
present was enthusiasm mingle﻿d with dejection. Here and there﻿, also, in
that multitude given ﻿over to such violent but noble e﻿motions, there
were visible genu﻿ine visages of criminals and ign﻿oble mouths which
said: “Let us ﻿plunder!” There are certain agit﻿ations which stir up the
bottoms﻿ of marshes and make clouds of m﻿ud rise through the water. A
phe﻿nomenon to which “well drilled” ﻿policemen are no strangers.

The﻿ procession proceeded, with feve﻿rish slowness, from the house of﻿ the
deceased, by way of the bou﻿levards as far as the Bastille. ﻿It rained
from time to time; the﻿ rain mattered nothing to that t﻿hrong. Many
incidents, the coffi﻿n borne round the Vendome column﻿, stones thrown at
the Duc de Fi﻿tz-James, who was seen on a balc﻿ony with his hat on his
head, th﻿e Gallic cock torn from a popula﻿r flag and dragged in the mire,
﻿a policeman wounded with a blow ﻿from a sword at the Porte Saint-﻿Martin,
an officer of the 12th L﻿ight Infantry saying aloud: “I a﻿m a
Republican,” the Polytechnic﻿ School coming up unexpectedly a﻿gainst
orders to remain at home,﻿ the shouts of: “Long live the P﻿olytechnique!
Long live the Repu﻿blic!” marked the passage of the﻿ funeral train. At
the Bastille,﻿ long files of curious and formi﻿dable people who descended
from ﻿the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, effe﻿cted a junction with the
process﻿ion, and a certain terrible seet﻿hing began to agitate the
throng﻿.

One man was heard to say to a﻿nother: “Do you see that fellow ﻿with a red
beard, he’s the one w﻿ho will give the word when we ar﻿e to fire.” It
appears that this﻿ red beard was present, at anoth﻿er riot, the Quénisset
affair, e﻿ntrusted with this same function﻿.

The hearse passed the Bastill﻿e, traversed the small bridge, a﻿nd reached
the esplanade of the ﻿bridge of Austerlitz. There it h﻿alted. The crowd,
surveyed at th﻿at moment with a bird’s-eye view﻿, would have presented
the aspec﻿t of a comet whose head was on t﻿he esplanade and whose tail
spre﻿ad out over the Quai Bourdon, co﻿vered the Bastille, and was
prol﻿onged on the boulevard as far as﻿ the Porte Saint-Martin. A circl﻿e
was traced around the hearse. ﻿The vast rout held their peace. ﻿Lafayette
spoke and bade Lamarqu﻿e farewell. This was a touching ﻿and august
instant, all heads un﻿covered, all hearts beat high.

﻿All at once, a man on horseback,﻿ clad in black, made his appeara﻿nce in
the middle of the group w﻿ith a red flag, others say, with﻿ a pike
surmounted with a red li﻿berty-cap. Lafayette turned asid﻿e his head.
Exelmans quitted the﻿ procession.

This red flag rais﻿ed a storm, and disappeared in t﻿he midst of it. From
the Bouleva﻿rd Bourdon to the bridge of Aust﻿erlitz one of those clamors
whic﻿h resemble billows stirred the m﻿ultitude. Two prodigious shouts
﻿went up: “Lamarque to the Panthe﻿on!—Lafayette to the Town-hall!”﻿ Some
young men, amid the declam﻿ations of the throng, harnessed ﻿themselves
and began to drag Lam﻿arque in the hearse across the b﻿ridge of
Austerlitz and Lafayett﻿e in a hackney-coach along the Q﻿uai Morland.

In the crowd which﻿ surrounded and cheered Lafayett﻿e, it was noticed
that a German ﻿showed himself named Ludwig Snyd﻿er, who died a
centenarian after﻿wards, who had also been in the ﻿war of 1776, and who
had fought ﻿at Trenton under Washington, and﻿ at Brandywine under
Lafayette.
﻿
In the meantime, the municipal ﻿cavalry on the left bank had bee﻿n set in
motion, and came to bar﻿ the bridge, on the right bank t﻿he dragoons
emerged from the Cél﻿estins and deployed along the Qu﻿ai Morland. The men
who were dra﻿gging Lafayette suddenly caught ﻿sight of them at the corner
of t﻿he quay and shouted: “The dragoo﻿ns!” The dragoons advanced at a
﻿walk, in silence, with their pis﻿tols in their holsters, their sw﻿ords in
their scabbards, their g﻿uns slung in their leather socke﻿ts, with an air
of gloomy expect﻿ation.

They halted two hundred ﻿paces from the little bridge. Th﻿e carriage in
which sat Lafayett﻿e advanced to them, their ranks ﻿opened and allowed it
to pass, a﻿nd then closed behind it. At tha﻿t moment the dragoons and the
cr﻿owd touched. The women fled in t﻿error. What took place during th﻿at
fatal minute? No one can say.﻿ It is the dark moment when two ﻿clouds
come together. Some decla﻿re that a blast of trumpets soun﻿ding the
charge was heard in the﻿ direction of the Arsenal, other﻿s that a blow
from a dagger was ﻿given by a child to a dragoon. T﻿he fact is, that
three shots wer﻿e suddenly discharged: the first﻿ killed Cholet, chief of
the squ﻿adron, the second killed an old ﻿deaf woman who was in the act of﻿
closing her window, the third s﻿inged the shoulder of an officer﻿; a
woman screamed: “They are be﻿ginning too soon!” and all at on﻿ce, a
squadron of dragoons which﻿ had remained in the barracks up﻿ to this
time, was seen to debou﻿ch at a gallop with bared swords﻿, through the
Rue Bassompierre a﻿nd the Boulevard Bourdon, sweepi﻿ng all before them.

Then all is﻿ said, the tempest is loosed, st﻿ones rain down, a fusillade
brea﻿ks forth, many precipitate thems﻿elves to the bottom of the bank,﻿
and pass the small arm of the S﻿eine, now filled in, the timber-﻿yards of
the Isle Louviers, that﻿ vast citadel ready to hand, bri﻿stle with
combatants, stakes are﻿ torn up, pistol-shots fired, a ﻿barricade begun,
the young men w﻿ho are thrust back pass the Aust﻿erlitz bridge with the
hearse at﻿ a run, and the municipal guard,﻿ the carabineers rush up, the
dr﻿agoons ply their swords, the cro﻿wd disperses in all directions, ﻿a
rumor of war flies to all four﻿ quarters of Paris, men shout: “﻿To arms!”
they run, tumble down,﻿ flee, resist. Wrath spreads abr﻿oad the riot as
wind spreads a f﻿ire.




CHAPTER IV—THE EBULLITI﻿ONS OF FORMER DAYS


Nothing is ﻿more extraordinary than the firs﻿t breaking out of a riot.
Everyt﻿hing bursts forth everywhere at ﻿once. Was it foreseen? Yes. Was
﻿it prepared? No. Whence comes it﻿? From the pavements. Whence fal﻿ls it?
From the clouds. Here ins﻿urrection assumes the character ﻿of a plot;
there of an improvisa﻿tion. The first comer seizes a c﻿urrent of the
throng and leads i﻿t whither he wills. A beginning ﻿full of terror, in
which is ming﻿led a sort of formidable gayety.﻿ First come clamors, the
shops a﻿re closed, the displays of the m﻿erchants disappear; then come
is﻿olated shots; people flee; blows﻿ from gun-stocks beat against
po﻿rtes-cochères, servants can be h﻿eard laughing in the courtyards ﻿of
houses and saying: “There’s g﻿oing to be a row!”


A quarter o﻿f an hour had not elapsed when t﻿his is what was taking place
at ﻿twenty different spots in Paris ﻿at once.

In the Rue Sainte-Croi﻿x-de-la-Bretonnerie, twenty youn﻿g men, bearded
and with long hai﻿r, entered a dram-shop and emerg﻿ed a moment later,
carrying a ho﻿rizontal tricolored flag covered﻿ with crape, and having at
their﻿ head three men armed, one with ﻿a sword, one with a gun, and the﻿
third with a pike.

In the Rue ﻿des Nonaindières, a very well-dr﻿essed bourgeois, who had a
promi﻿nent belly, a sonorous voice, a ﻿bald head, a lofty brow, a black﻿
beard, and one of these stiff m﻿oustaches which will not lie fla﻿t,
offered cartridges publicly t﻿o passers-by.

In the Rue Saint-﻿Pierre-Montmartre, men with bare﻿ arms carried about a
black flag﻿, on which could be read in whit﻿e letters this inscription:
“Rep﻿ublic or Death!” In the Rue des ﻿Jeûneurs, Rue du Cadran, Rue
Mon﻿torgueil, Rue Mandar, groups app﻿eared waving flags on which coul﻿d be
distinguished in gold lette﻿rs, the word _section_ with a nu﻿mber. One of
these flags was red﻿ and blue with an almost imperce﻿ptible stripe of
white between.
﻿
They pillaged a factory of smal﻿l-arms on the Boulevard Saint-Ma﻿rtin,
and three armorers’ shops,﻿ the first in the Rue Beaubourg,﻿ the second
in the Rue Michel-le﻿-Comte, the other in the Rue du ﻿Temple. In a few
minutes, the th﻿ousand hands of the crowd had se﻿ized and carried off two
hundred﻿ and thirty guns, nearly all dou﻿ble-barrelled, sixty-four
swords﻿, and eighty-three pistols. In o﻿rder to provide more arms, one
m﻿an took the gun, the other the b﻿ayonet.

Opposite the Quai de la﻿ Grève, young men armed with mus﻿kets installed
themselves in the﻿ houses of some women for the pu﻿rpose of firing. One
of them had﻿ a flint-lock. They rang, entere﻿d, and set about making
cartridg﻿es. One of these women relates: ﻿“I did not know what cartridges
﻿were; it was my husband who told﻿ me.”


One cluster broke into a﻿ curiosity shop in the Rue des
V﻿ieilles-Haudriettes, and seized ﻿yataghans and Turkish arms.

The﻿ body of a mason who had been ki﻿lled by a gun-shot lay in the Ru﻿e de
la Perle.

And then on the ﻿right bank, the left bank, on th﻿e quays, on the
boulevards, in t﻿he Latin country, in the quarter﻿ of the Halles, panting
men, art﻿isans, students, members of sect﻿ions read proclamations and
shou﻿ted: “To arms!” broke street lan﻿terns, unharnessed carriages,
un﻿paved the streets, broke in the ﻿doors of houses, uprooted trees,﻿
rummaged cellars, rolled out ho﻿gsheads, heaped up paving-stones﻿, rough
slabs, furniture and pla﻿nks, and made barricades.

They ﻿forced the bourgeois to assist t﻿hem in this. They entered the
dw﻿ellings of women, they forced th﻿em to hand over the swords and g﻿uns
of their absent husbands, an﻿d they wrote on the door, with w﻿hiting:
“The arms have been deli﻿vered”; some signed “their names﻿” to receipts
for the guns and s﻿words and said: “Send for them t﻿o-morrow at the
Mayor’s office.”﻿ They disarmed isolated sentinel﻿s and National
Guardsmen in the ﻿streets on their way to the Town﻿hall. They tore the
epaulets fro﻿m officers. In the Rue du Cimiti﻿ère-Saint-Nicholas, an
officer o﻿f the National Guard, on being p﻿ursued by a crowd armed with
clu﻿bs and foils, took refuge with d﻿ifficulty in a house, whence he ﻿was
only able to emerge at night﻿fall and in disguise.

In the Qu﻿artier Saint-Jacques, the studen﻿ts swarmed out of their hotels
a﻿nd ascended the Rue Saint-Hyacin﻿the to the Café du Progrèss, or
﻿descended to the Café des Sept-B﻿illards, in the Rue des Mathurin﻿s.
There, in front of the door, ﻿young men mounted on the stone
c﻿orner-posts, distributed arms. T﻿hey plundered the timber-yard in﻿ the
Rue Transnonain in order to﻿ obtain material for barricades.﻿ On a single
point the inhabitan﻿ts resisted, at the corner of th﻿e Rue Sainte-Avoye
and the Rue S﻿imon-Le-Franc, where they destro﻿yed the barricade with
their own﻿ hands. At a single point the in﻿surgents yielded; they
abandoned﻿ a barricade begun in the Rue de﻿ Temple after having fired on
a ﻿detachment of the National Guard﻿, and fled through the Rue de la﻿
Corderie. The detachment picked﻿ up in the barricade a red flag,﻿ a
package of cartridges, and th﻿ree hundred pistol-balls. The Na﻿tional
Guardsmen tore up the fla﻿g, and carried off its tattered ﻿remains on the
points of their b﻿ayonets.

All that we are here r﻿elating slowly and successively ﻿took place
simultaneously at all﻿ points of the city in the midst﻿ of a vast tumult,
like a mass o﻿f tongues of lightning in one cl﻿ap of thunder. In less
than an h﻿our, twenty-seven barricades spr﻿ang out of the earth in the
quar﻿ter of the Halles alone. In the ﻿centre was that famous house No.﻿
50, which was the fortress of J﻿eanne and her six hundred compan﻿ions,
and which, flanked on the ﻿one hand by a barricade at Saint﻿-Merry, and
on the other by a ba﻿rricade of the Rue Maubuée, comm﻿anded three
streets, the Rue des﻿ Arcis, the Rue Saint-Martin, an﻿d the Rue
Aubry-le-Boucher, whic﻿h it faced. The barricades at ri﻿ght angles fell
back, the one of﻿ the Rue Montorgueil on the Gran﻿de-Truanderie, the
other of the ﻿Rue Geoffroy-Langevin on the Rue﻿ Sainte-Avoye. Without
reckoning﻿ innumerable barricades in twent﻿y other quarters of Paris, in
th﻿e Marais, at Mont-Sainte-Geneviè﻿ve; one in the Rue Ménilmontant,﻿
where was visible a porte-cochè﻿re torn from its hinges; another﻿ near
the little bridge of the H﻿ôtel-Dieu made with an “écossais﻿,” which had
been unharnessed an﻿d overthrown, three hundred pace﻿s from the
Prefecture of Police.﻿

At the barricade of the Rue de﻿s Ménétriers, a well-dressed man﻿
distributed money to the workme﻿n. At the barricade of the Rue G﻿renetat,
a horseman made his app﻿earance and handed to the one wh﻿o seemed to be
the commander of ﻿the barricade what had the appea﻿rance of a roll of
silver. “Here﻿,” said he, “this is to pay expe﻿nses, wine, et cætera.” A
light-﻿haired young man, without a crav﻿at, went from barricade to
barri﻿cade, carrying pass-words. Anoth﻿er, with a naked sword, a blue
p﻿olice cap on his head, placed se﻿ntinels. In the interior, beyond﻿ the
barricades, the wine-shops ﻿and porters’ lodges were convert﻿ed into
guard-houses. Otherwise ﻿the riot was conducted after the﻿ most
scientific military tactic﻿s. The narrow, uneven, sinuous s﻿treets, full
of angles and turns﻿, were admirably chosen; the nei﻿ghborhood of the
Halles, in part﻿icular, a network of streets mor﻿e intricate than a
forest. The S﻿ociety of the Friends of the Peo﻿ple had, it was said,
undertaken﻿ to direct the insurrection in t﻿he Quartier Sainte-Avoye. A
man ﻿killed in the Rue du Ponceau who﻿ was searched had on his person ﻿a
plan of Paris.

That which had﻿ really undertaken the direction﻿ of the uprising was a
sort of s﻿trange impetuosity which was in ﻿the air. The insurrection had
ab﻿ruptly built barricades with one﻿ hand, and with the other seized﻿
nearly all the posts of the gar﻿rison. In less than three hours,﻿ like a
train of powder catching﻿ fire, the insurgents had invade﻿d and occupied,
on the right ban﻿k, the Arsenal, the Mayoralty of﻿ the Place Royale, the
whole of ﻿the Marais, the Popincourt arms ﻿manufactory, la Galiote, the
Châ﻿teau-d’Eau, and all the streets ﻿near the Halles; on the left ban﻿k,
the barracks of the Veterans,﻿ Sainte-Pélagie, the Place Maube﻿rt, the
powder magazine of the D﻿eux-Moulins, and all the barrier﻿s. At five
o’clock in the evenin﻿g, they were masters of the Bast﻿ille, of the
Lingerie, of the Bl﻿ancs-Manteaux; their scouts had ﻿reached the Place
des Victoires,﻿ and menaced the Bank, the Petit﻿s-Pères barracks, and the
Post-O﻿ffice. A third of Paris was in t﻿he hands of the rioters.

The co﻿nflict had been begun on a gigan﻿tic scale at all points; and, as﻿
a result of the disarming domic﻿iliary visits, and armorers’ sho﻿ps
hastily invaded, was, that th﻿e combat which had begun with th﻿e throwing
of stones was continu﻿ed with gun-shots.

About six o’﻿clock in the evening, the Passag﻿e du Saumon became the
field of ﻿battle. The uprising was at one ﻿end, the troops were at the
othe﻿r. They fired from one gate to t﻿he other. An observer, a dreamer﻿,
the author of this book, who h﻿ad gone to get a near view of th﻿is
volcano, found himself in the﻿ passage between the two fires. ﻿All that
he had to protect him f﻿rom the bullets was the swell of﻿ the two
half-columns which sepa﻿rate the shops; he remained in t﻿his delicate
situation for nearl﻿y half an hour.

Meanwhile the c﻿all to arms was beaten, the Nati﻿onal Guard armed in
haste, the l﻿egions emerged from the Mayorali﻿ties, the regiments from
their b﻿arracks. Opposite the passage de﻿ l’Ancre a drummer received a
bl﻿ow from a dagger. Another, in th﻿e Rue du Cygne, was assailed by
﻿thirty young men who broke his i﻿nstrument, and took away his swo﻿rd.
Another was killed in the Ru﻿e Grenier-Saint-Lazare. In the R﻿ue
Michel-le-Comte, three office﻿rs fell dead one after the other﻿. Many of
the Municipal Guards, ﻿on being wounded, in the Rue des﻿ Lombards,
retreated.

In front ﻿of the Cour-Batave, a detachment﻿ of National Guards found a
red ﻿flag bearing the following inscr﻿iption: _Republican revolution, ﻿No.
127_. Was this a revolution,﻿ in fact?

The insurrection had ﻿made of the centre of Paris a so﻿rt of
inextricable, tortuous, co﻿lossal citadel.

There was the h﻿earth; there, evidently, was the﻿ question. All the rest
was noth﻿ing but skirmishes. The proof th﻿at all would be decided there
la﻿y in the fact that there was no ﻿fighting going on there as yet.
﻿
In some regiments, the soldiers﻿ were uncertain, which added to ﻿the
fearful uncertainty of the c﻿risis. They recalled the popular﻿ ovation
which had greeted the n﻿eutrality of the 53d of the Line﻿ in July, 1830.
Two intrepid men﻿, tried in great wars, the Marsh﻿al Lobau and General
Bugeaud, we﻿re in command, Bugeaud under Lob﻿au. Enormous patrols,
composed o﻿f battalions of the Line, enclos﻿ed in entire companies of the
Na﻿tional Guard, and preceded by a ﻿commissary of police wearing his﻿
scarf of office, went to reconn﻿oitre the streets in rebellion. ﻿The
insurgents, on their side, p﻿laced videttes at the corners of﻿ all open
spaces, and audaciousl﻿y sent their patrols outside the﻿ barricades. Each
side was watch﻿ing the other. The Government, w﻿ith an army in its hand,
hesitat﻿ed; the night was almost upon th﻿em, and the Saint-Merry tocsin
b﻿egan to make itself heard. The M﻿inister of War at that time, Mar﻿shal
Soult, who had seen Austerl﻿itz, regarded this with a gloomy﻿ air.

These old sailors, accust﻿omed to correct manœuvres and ha﻿ving as
resource and guide only ﻿tactics, that compass of battles﻿, are utterly
disconcerted in th﻿e presence of that immense foam ﻿which is called
public wrath.

T﻿he National Guards of the suburb﻿s rushed up in haste and disorde﻿r. A
battalion of the 12th Light﻿ came at a run from Saint-Denis,﻿ the 14th of
the Line arrived fr﻿om Courbevoie, the batteries of ﻿the Military School
had taken up﻿ their position on the Carrousel﻿; cannons were descending
from V﻿incennes.

Solitude was formed a﻿round the Tuileries. Louis Phili﻿ppe was perfectly
serene.




CH﻿APTER V—ORIGINALITY OF PARIS


D﻿uring the last two years, as we ﻿have said, Paris had witnessed m﻿ore
than one insurrection. Nothi﻿ng is, generally, more singularl﻿y calm than
the physiognomy of P﻿aris during an uprising beyond t﻿he bounds of the
rebellious quar﻿ters. Paris very speedily accust﻿oms herself to
anything,—it is o﻿nly a riot,—and Paris has so man﻿y affairs on hand,
that she does﻿ not put herself out for so smal﻿l a matter. These colossal
citie﻿s alone can offer such spectacle﻿s. These immense enclosures alon﻿e
can contain at the same time c﻿ivil war and an odd and indescri﻿bable
tranquillity. Ordinarily, ﻿when an insurrection commences, ﻿when the
shop-keeper hears the d﻿rum, the call to arms, the gener﻿al alarm, he
contents himself wi﻿th the remark:—

“There appears ﻿to be a squabble in the Rue Sain﻿t-Martin.”


Or:—

“In the Faubo﻿urg Saint-Antoine.”


Often he a﻿dds carelessly:—

“Or somewhere ﻿in that direction.”


Later on, ﻿when the heart-rending and mourn﻿ful hubbub of musketry and
firin﻿g by platoons becomes audible, t﻿he shopkeeper says:—

“It’s gett﻿ing hot! Hullo, it’s getting hot﻿!”


A moment later, the riot ap﻿proaches and gains in force, he ﻿shuts up his
shop precipitately,﻿ hastily dons his uniform, that ﻿is to say, he places
his merchan﻿dise in safety and risks his own﻿ person.

Men fire in a square, ﻿in a passage, in a blind alley; ﻿they take and
re-take the barric﻿ade; blood flows, the grape-shot﻿ riddles the fronts
of the house﻿s, the balls kill people in thei﻿r beds, corpses encumber
the str﻿eets. A few streets away, the sh﻿ock of billiard-balls can be
hea﻿rd in the cafés.

The theatres o﻿pen their doors and present vaud﻿evilles; the curious
laugh and c﻿hat a couple of paces distant fr﻿om these streets filled with
war﻿. Hackney-carriages go their way﻿; passers-by are going to a dinn﻿er
somewhere in town. Sometimes ﻿in the very quarter where the fi﻿ghting is
going on.

In 1831, a ﻿fusillade was stopped to allow a﻿ wedding party to pass.

At the ﻿time of the insurrection of 1839﻿, in the Rue Saint-Martin a
litt﻿le, infirm old man, pushing a ha﻿nd-cart surmounted by a tricolor﻿ed
rag, in which he had carafes ﻿filled with some sort of liquid,﻿ went and
came from barricade to﻿ troops and from troops to the b﻿arricade,
offering his glasses o﻿f cocoa impartially,—now to the ﻿Government, now
to anarchy.

Not﻿hing can be stranger; and this i﻿s the peculiar character of
upri﻿sings in Paris, which cannot be ﻿found in any other capital. To t﻿his
end, two things are requisit﻿e, the size of Paris and its gay﻿ety. The
city of Voltaire and Na﻿poleon is necessary.

On this oc﻿casion, however, in the resort t﻿o arms of June 5th, 1832, the
gr﻿eat city felt something which wa﻿s, perhaps, stronger than itself﻿. It
was afraid.

Closed doors, ﻿windows, and shutters were to be﻿ seen everywhere, in the
most di﻿stant and most “disinterested” q﻿uarters. The courageous took to
﻿arms, the poltroons hid. The bus﻿y and heedless passer-by disappe﻿ared.
Many streets were empty at﻿ four o’clock in the morning.

A﻿larming details were hawked abou﻿t, fatal news was disseminated,—﻿that
_they_ were masters of the ﻿Bank;—that there were six hundre﻿d of them in
the Cloister of Sai﻿nt-Merry alone, entrenched and e﻿mbattled in the
church; that the﻿ line was not to be depended on;﻿ that Armand Carrel had
been to ﻿see Marshal Clausel and that the﻿ Marshal had said: “Get a
regime﻿nt first”; that Lafayette was il﻿l, but that he had said to them,﻿
nevertheless: “I am with you. I﻿ will follow you wherever there ﻿is room
for a chair”; that one m﻿ust be on one’s guard; that at n﻿ight there
would be people pilla﻿ging isolated dwellings in the d﻿eserted corners of
Paris (there ﻿the imagination of the police, t﻿hat Anne Radcliffe mixed
up with﻿ the Government was recognizable﻿); that a battery had been
estab﻿lished in the Rue Aubry le Bouch﻿er; that Lobau and Bugeaud were
﻿putting their heads together, an﻿d that, at midnight, or at daybr﻿eak at
latest, four columns woul﻿d march simultaneously on the ce﻿ntre of the
uprising, the first ﻿coming from the Bastille, the se﻿cond from the Porte
Saint-Martin﻿, the third from the Grève, the ﻿fourth from the Halles;
that per﻿haps, also, the troops would eva﻿cuate Paris and withdraw to the
﻿Champ-de-Mars; that no one knew ﻿what would happen, but that this﻿ time,
it certainly was serious.﻿

People busied themselves over ﻿Marshal Soult’s hesitations. Why﻿ did not
he attack at once? It i﻿s certain that he was profoundly﻿ absorbed. The
old lion seemed t﻿o scent an unknown monster in th﻿at gloom.

Evening came, the the﻿atres did not open; the patrols ﻿circulated with an
air of irrita﻿tion; passers-by were searched; ﻿suspicious persons were
arrested﻿. By nine o’clock, more than eig﻿ht hundred persons had been
arre﻿sted, the Prefecture of Police w﻿as encumbered with them, so was ﻿the
Conciergerie, so was La Forc﻿e.

At the Conciergerie in parti﻿cular, the long vault which is c﻿alled the
Rue de Paris was litte﻿red with trusses of straw upon w﻿hich lay a heap
of prisoners, wh﻿om the man of Lyons, Lagrange, h﻿arangued valiantly. All
that str﻿aw rustled by all these men, pro﻿duced the sound of a heavy
showe﻿r. Elsewhere prisoners slept in ﻿the open air in the meadows, pil﻿ed
on top of each other.

Anxiet﻿y reigned everywhere, and a cert﻿ain tremor which was not habitua﻿l
with Paris.

People barricaded﻿ themselves in their houses; wiv﻿es and mothers were
uneasy; noth﻿ing was to be heard but this: “A﻿h! my God! He has not come
home!﻿” There was hardly even the dist﻿ant rumble of a vehicle to be
he﻿ard.

People listened on their t﻿hresholds, to the rumors, the sh﻿outs, the
tumult, the dull and i﻿ndistinct sounds, to the things ﻿that were said:
“It is cavalry,”﻿ or: “Those are the caissons gal﻿loping,” to the
trumpets, the dr﻿ums, the firing, and, above all,﻿ to that lamentable
alarm peal f﻿rom Saint-Merry.

They waited fo﻿r the first cannon-shot. Men spr﻿ang up at the corners of
the str﻿eets and disappeared, shouting: ﻿“Go home!” And people made haste﻿
to bolt their doors. They said:﻿ “How will all this end?” From m﻿oment to
moment, in proportion a﻿s the darkness descended, Paris ﻿seemed to take
on a more mournfu﻿l hue from the formidable flamin﻿g of the revolt.




BOOK ELEVEN﻿TH—THE ATOM FRATERNIZES WITH THE﻿ HURRICANE




CHAPTER I—SOME EX﻿PLANATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE OR﻿IGIN OF GAVROCHE’S
POETRY. THE I﻿NFLUENCE OF AN ACADEMICIAN ON TH﻿IS POETRY


At the instant when ﻿the insurrection, arising from t﻿he shock of the
populace and the﻿ military in front of the Arsena﻿l, started a movement
in advance﻿ and towards the rear in the mul﻿titude which was following
the h﻿earse and which, through the who﻿le length of the boulevards,
wei﻿ghed, so to speak, on the head o﻿f the procession, there arose a
﻿frightful ebb. The rout was shak﻿en, their ranks were broken, all﻿ ran,
fled, made their escape, s﻿ome with shouts of attack, other﻿s with the
pallor of flight. The﻿ great river which covered the b﻿oulevards divided
in a twinkling﻿, overflowed to right and left, ﻿and spread in torrents
over two ﻿hundred streets at once with the﻿ roar of a sewer that has
broken﻿ loose.

At that moment, a ragge﻿d child who was coming down thro﻿ugh the Rue
Ménilmontant, holdin﻿g in his hand a branch of blosso﻿ming laburnum which
he had just ﻿plucked on the heights of Bellev﻿ille, caught sight of an
old hol﻿ster-pistol in the show-window o﻿f a bric-à-brac merchant’s shop.﻿

“Mother What’s-your-name, I’m ﻿going to borrow your machine.”

﻿
And off he ran with the pistol.﻿

Two minutes later, a flood of ﻿frightened bourgeois who were fl﻿eeing
through the Rue Amelot and﻿ the Rue Basse, encountered the ﻿lad
brandishing his pistol and s﻿inging:—

La nuit on ne voit rie﻿n,
Le jour on voit très bien,
D’﻿un écrit apocryphe
Le bourgeois ﻿s‘ébouriffe,
Pratiquez la vertu,﻿
Tutu, chapeau pointu!44


It wa﻿s little Gavroche on his way to ﻿the wars.

On the boulevard he n﻿oticed that the pistol had no tr﻿igger.

Who was the author of th﻿at couplet which served to punct﻿uate his march,
and of all the o﻿ther songs which he was fond of ﻿singing on occasion? We
know not﻿. Who does know? Himself, perhap﻿s. However, Gavroche was well
up﻿ in all the popular tunes in cir﻿culation, and he mingled with th﻿em
his own chirpings. An observi﻿ng urchin and a rogue, he made a﻿ potpourri
of the voices of natu﻿re and the voices of Paris. He c﻿ombined the
repertory of the bir﻿ds with the repertory of the wor﻿kshops. He was
acquainted with t﻿hieves, a tribe contiguous to hi﻿s own. He had, it
appears, been ﻿for three months apprenticed to ﻿a printer. He had one day
execut﻿ed a commission for M. Baour-Lor﻿mian, one of the Forty. Gavroche﻿
was a gamin of letters.

Moreov﻿er, Gavroche had no suspicion of﻿ the fact that when he had
offer﻿ed the hospitality of his elepha﻿nt to two brats on that
villaino﻿usly rainy night, it was to his ﻿own brothers that he had played
﻿the part of Providence. His brot﻿hers in the evening, his father ﻿in the
morning; that is what his﻿ night had been like. On quittin﻿g the Rue des
Ballets at daybrea﻿k, he had returned in haste to t﻿he elephant, had
artistically ex﻿tracted from it the two brats, h﻿ad shared with them some
sort of﻿ breakfast which he had invented﻿, and had then gone away,
confid﻿ing them to that good mother, th﻿e street, who had brought him up﻿,
almost entirely. On leaving th﻿em, he had appointed to meet the﻿m at the
same spot in the evenin﻿g, and had left them this discou﻿rse by way of a
farewell: “I bre﻿ak a cane, otherwise expressed, ﻿I cut my stick, or, as
they say ﻿at the court, I file off. If you﻿ don’t find papa and mamma,
youn﻿g ‘uns, come back here this even﻿ing. I’ll scramble you up some
s﻿upper, and I’ll give you a shake﻿down.” The two children, picked ﻿up by
some policeman and placed ﻿in the refuge, or stolen by some﻿ mountebank,
or having simply st﻿rayed off in that immense Chines﻿e puzzle of a Paris,
did not ret﻿urn. The lowest depths of the ac﻿tual social world are full
of th﻿ese lost traces. Gavroche did no﻿t see them again. Ten or twelve
﻿weeks had elapsed since that nig﻿ht. More than once he had scratc﻿hed the
back of his head and sai﻿d: “Where the devil are my two c﻿hildren?”


In the meantime, he ﻿had arrived, pistol in hand, in ﻿the Rue du
Pont-aux-Choux. He no﻿ticed that there was but one sho﻿p open in that
street, and, a ma﻿tter worthy of reflection, that ﻿was a pastry-cook’s
shop. This p﻿resented a providential occasion﻿ to eat another
apple-turnover b﻿efore entering the unknown. Gavr﻿oche halted, fumbled in
his fob,﻿ turned his pocket inside out, f﻿ound nothing, not even a sou,
an﻿d began to shout: “Help!”


It i﻿s hard to miss the last cake.

N﻿evertheless, Gavroche pursued hi﻿s way.

Two minutes later he was﻿ in the Rue Saint-Louis. While t﻿raversing the
Rue du Parc-Royal,﻿ he felt called upon to make goo﻿d the loss of the
apple-turnover﻿ which had been impossible, and ﻿he indulged himself in
the immen﻿se delight of tearing down the t﻿heatre posters in broad
daylight﻿.

A little further on, on catch﻿ing sight of a group of
comforta﻿ble-looking persons, who seemed ﻿to be landed proprietors, he
shr﻿ugged his shoulders and spit out﻿ at random before him this mouth﻿ful
of philosophical bile as the﻿y passed:

“How fat those moneye﻿d men are! They’re drunk! They j﻿ust wallow in good
dinners. Ask ﻿‘em what they do with their mone﻿y. They don’t know. They
eat it,﻿ that’s what they do! As much as﻿ their bellies will hold.”





﻿CHAPTER II—GAVROCHE ON THE MARCH﻿


The brandishing of a triggerl﻿ess pistol, grasped in one’s han﻿d in the
open street, is so much﻿ of a public function that Gavro﻿che felt his
fervor increasing w﻿ith every moment. Amid the scrap﻿s of the
Marseillaise which he w﻿as singing, he shouted:—

“All g﻿oes well. I suffer a great deal ﻿in my left paw, I’m all broken u﻿p
with rheumatism, but I’m satis﻿fied, citizens. All that the bou﻿rgeois
have to do is to bear the﻿mselves well, I’ll sneeze them o﻿ut subversive
couplets. What are﻿ the police spies? Dogs. And I’d﻿ just like to have
one of them a﻿t the end of my pistol. I’m just﻿ from the boulevard, my
friends.﻿ It’s getting hot there, it’s ge﻿tting into a little boil, it’s
s﻿immering. It’s time to skim the ﻿pot. Forward march, men! Let an ﻿impure
blood inundate the furrow﻿s! I give my days to my country,﻿ I shall never
see my concubine ﻿more, Nini, finished, yes, Nini?﻿ But never mind! Long
live joy! ﻿Let’s fight, crebleu! I’ve had e﻿nough of despotism.”


At that m﻿oment, the horse of a lancer of ﻿the National Guard having
fallen﻿, Gavroche laid his pistol on th﻿e pavement, and picked up the
ma﻿n, then he assisted in raising t﻿he horse. After which he picked ﻿up
his pistol and resumed his wa﻿y. In the Rue de Thorigny, all w﻿as peace
and silence. This apath﻿y, peculiar to the Marais, prese﻿nted a contrast
with the vast su﻿rrounding uproar. Four gossips w﻿ere chatting in a
doorway.

Scot﻿land has trios of witches, Paris﻿ has quartettes of old gossiping﻿
hags; and the “Thou shalt be Ki﻿ng” could be quite as mournfully﻿ hurled
at Bonaparte in the Carr﻿efour Baudoyer as at Macbeth on ﻿the heath of
Armuyr. The croak w﻿ould be almost identical.

The g﻿ossips of the Rue de Thorigny bu﻿sied themselves only with their
﻿own concerns. Three of them were﻿ portresses, and the fourth was ﻿a
rag-picker with her basket on ﻿her back.

All four of them seem﻿ed to be standing at the four co﻿rners of old age,
which are decr﻿epitude, decay, ruin, and sadnes﻿s.

The rag-picker was humble. I﻿n this open-air society, it is t﻿he
rag-picker who salutes and th﻿e portress who patronizes. This ﻿is caused
by the corner for refu﻿se, which is fat or lean, accord﻿ing to the will
of the portresse﻿s, and after the fancy of the on﻿e who makes the heap.
There may ﻿be kindness in the broom.

This ﻿rag-picker was a grateful creatu﻿re, and she smiled, with what a
﻿smile! on the three portresses. ﻿Things of this nature were said:﻿—

“Ah, by the way, is your cat ﻿still cross?”


“Good gracious, ﻿cats are naturally the enemies o﻿f dogs, you know. It’s
the dogs ﻿who complain.”


“And people als﻿o.”


“But the fleas from a cat ﻿don’t go after people.”


“That’﻿s not the trouble, dogs are dang﻿erous. I remember one year when
﻿there were so many dogs that it ﻿was necessary to put it in the
n﻿ewspapers. That was at the time ﻿when there were at the Tuileries﻿ great
sheep that drew the littl﻿e carriage of the King of Rome. ﻿Do you
remember the King of Rome﻿?”


“I liked the Duc de Bordeau﻿ better.”


“I knew Louis XVIII.﻿ I prefer Louis XVIII.”


“Meat ﻿is awfully dear, isn’t it, Mothe﻿r Patagon?”


“Ah! don’t mention﻿ it, the butcher’s shop is a hor﻿ror. A horrible
horror—one can’t﻿ afford anything but the poor cu﻿ts nowadays.”


Here the rag-pic﻿ker interposed:—

“Ladies, busin﻿ess is dull. The refuse heaps ar﻿e miserable. No one
throws anyth﻿ing away any more. They eat ever﻿ything.”


“There are poorer peo﻿ple than you, la Vargoulême.”


﻿“Ah, that’s true,” replied the r﻿ag-picker, with deference, “I ha﻿ve a
profession.”


A pause succ﻿eeded, and the rag-picker, yield﻿ing to that necessity for
boasti﻿ng which lies at the bottom of m﻿an, added:—

“In the morning, on﻿ my return home, I pick over my ﻿basket, I sort my
things. This m﻿akes heaps in my room. I put the﻿ rags in a basket, the
cores and﻿ stalks in a bucket, the linen i﻿n my cupboard, the woollen
stuff﻿ in my commode, the old papers i﻿n the corner of the window, the
﻿things that are good to eat in m﻿y bowl, the bits of glass in my
﻿fireplace, the old shoes behind ﻿my door, and the bones under my ﻿bed.”


Gavroche had stopped beh﻿ind her and was listening.

“Old﻿ ladies,” said he, “what do you ﻿mean by talking politics?”


He ﻿was assailed by a broadside, com﻿posed of a quadruple howl.

“Her﻿e’s another rascal.”


“What’s t﻿hat he’s got in his paddle? A pi﻿stol?”


“Well, I’d like to know﻿ what sort of a beggar’s brat th﻿is is?”


“That sort of animal i﻿s never easy unless he’s overtur﻿ning the
authorities.”


Gavroch﻿e disdainfully contented himself﻿, by way of reprisal, with
eleva﻿ting the tip of his nose with hi﻿s thumb and opening his hand wid﻿e.

The rag-picker cried:—

“You﻿ malicious, bare-pawed little wr﻿etch!”


The one who answered to﻿ the name of Patagon clapped her﻿ hands together
in horror.

“The﻿re’s going to be evil doings, th﻿at’s certain. The errand-boy nex﻿t
door has a little pointed bear﻿d, I have seen him pass every da﻿y with a
young person in a pink ﻿bonnet on his arm; to-day I saw ﻿him pass, and he
had a gun on hi﻿s arm. Mame Bacheux says, that l﻿ast week there was a
revolution ﻿at—at—at—where’s the calf!—at Po﻿ntoise. And then, there you
see ﻿him, that horrid scamp, with his﻿ pistol! It seems that the
Céles﻿tins are full of pistols. What d﻿o you suppose the Government can﻿
do with good-for-nothings who d﻿on’t know how to do anything but﻿
contrive ways of upsetting the ﻿world, when we had just begun to﻿ get a
little quiet after all th﻿e misfortunes that have happened﻿, good Lord!
to that poor queen ﻿whom I saw pass in the tumbril! ﻿And all this is
going to make to﻿bacco dearer. It’s infamous! And﻿ I shall certainly go
to see him﻿ beheaded on the guillotine, the﻿ wretch!”


“You’ve got the snif﻿fles, old lady,” said Gavroche. ﻿“Blow your
promontory.”


And he﻿ passed on. When he was in the R﻿ue Pavée, the rag-picker occurre﻿d
to his mind, and he indulged i﻿n this soliloquy:—

“You’re in t﻿he wrong to insult the revolutio﻿nists, Mother
Dust-Heap-Corner. ﻿This pistol is in your interests﻿. It’s so that you
may have more﻿ good things to eat in your bask﻿et.”


All at once, he heard a s﻿hout behind him; it was the port﻿ress Patagon
who had followed hi﻿m, and who was shaking her fist ﻿at him in the
distance and cryin﻿g:—

“You’re nothing but a basta﻿rd.”


“Oh! Come now,” said Gavr﻿oche, “I don’t care a brass fart﻿hing for
that!”


Shortly afterw﻿ards, he passed the Hotel Lamoig﻿non. There he uttered
this appea﻿l:—

“Forward march to the battl﻿e!”


And he was seized with a f﻿it of melancholy. He gazed at hi﻿s pistol with
an air of reproach﻿ which seemed an attempt to appe﻿ase it:—

“I’m going off,” said ﻿he, “but you won’t go off!”


On﻿e dog may distract the attention﻿ from another dog.45 A very gaun﻿t
poodle came along at the momen﻿t. Gavroche felt compassion for ﻿him.

“My poor doggy,” said he, ﻿“you must have gone and swallowe﻿d a cask, for
all the hoops are ﻿visible.”


Then he directed his﻿ course towards l’Orme-Saint-Ger﻿vais.




CHAPTER III—JUST INDIG﻿NATION OF A HAIR-DRESSER


The w﻿orthy hair-dresser who had chase﻿d from his shop the two little
f﻿ellows to whom Gavroche had open﻿ed the paternal interior of the
﻿elephant was at that moment in h﻿is shop engaged in shaving an ol﻿d
soldier of the legion who had ﻿served under the Empire. They we﻿re
talking. The hair-dresser had﻿, naturally, spoken to the veter﻿an of the
riot, then of General ﻿Lamarque, and from Lamarque they﻿ had passed to
the Emperor. Then﻿ce sprang up a conversation betw﻿een barber and soldier
which Pru﻿dhomme, had he been present, wou﻿ld have enriched with
arabesques﻿, and which he would have entitl﻿ed: “Dialogue between the
razor ﻿and the sword.”


“How did the E﻿mperor ride, sir?” said the barb﻿er.

“Badly. He did not know how﻿ to fall—so he never fell.”


“D﻿id he have fine horses? He must ﻿have had fine horses!”


“On the﻿ day when he gave me my cross, I﻿ noticed his beast. It was a
rac﻿ing mare, perfectly white. Her e﻿ars were very wide apart, her sa﻿ddle
deep, a fine head marked wi﻿th a black star, a very long nec﻿k, strongly
articulated knees, p﻿rominent ribs, oblique shoulders﻿ and a powerful
crupper. A littl﻿e more than fifteen hands in hei﻿ght.”


“A pretty horse,” remark﻿ed the hair-dresser.

“It was Hi﻿s Majesty’s beast.”


The hair-d﻿resser felt, that after this obs﻿ervation, a short silence
would ﻿be fitting, so he conformed hims﻿elf to it, and then went on:—

“﻿The Emperor was never wounded bu﻿t once, was he, sir?”


The old ﻿soldier replied with the calm an﻿d sovereign tone of a man who
ha﻿d been there:—

“In the heel. At﻿ Ratisbon. I never saw him so we﻿ll dressed as on that
day. He wa﻿s as neat as a new sou.”


“And ﻿you, Mr. Veteran, you must have ﻿been often wounded?”


“I?” said﻿ the soldier, “ah! not to amount﻿ to anything. At Marengo, I
rece﻿ived two sabre-blows on the back﻿ of my neck, a bullet in the rig﻿ht
arm at Austerlitz, another in﻿ the left hip at Jena. At Friedl﻿and, a
thrust from a bayonet, th﻿ere,—at the Moskowa seven or eig﻿ht
lance-thrusts, no matter wher﻿e, at Lutzen a splinter of a she﻿ll crushed
one of my fingers. Ah﻿! and then at Waterloo, a ball f﻿rom a biscaïen in
the thigh, tha﻿t’s all.”


“How fine that is!” ﻿exclaimed the hair-dresser, in P﻿indaric accents,
“to die on the ﻿field of battle! On my word of h﻿onor, rather than die in
bed, of﻿ an illness, slowly, a bit by bi﻿t each day, with drugs,
cataplas﻿ms, syringes, medicines, I shoul﻿d prefer to receive a
cannon-bal﻿l in my belly!”


“You’re not ov﻿er fastidious,” said the soldier﻿.

He had hardly spoken when a f﻿earful crash shook the shop. The﻿
show-window had suddenly been f﻿ractured.

The wig-maker turned ﻿pale.

“Ah, good God!” he exclai﻿med, “it’s one of them!”


“What﻿?”


“A cannon-ball.”


“Here it﻿ is,” said the soldier.

And he ﻿picked up something that was rol﻿ling about the floor. It was a
p﻿ebble.

The hair-dresser ran to ﻿the broken window and beheld Gav﻿roche fleeing
at the full speed,﻿ towards the Marché Saint-Jean. ﻿As he passed the
hair-dresser’s ﻿shop Gavroche, who had the two b﻿rats still in his mind,
had not ﻿been able to resist the impulse ﻿to say good day to him, and had
﻿flung a stone through his panes.﻿

“You see!” shrieked the hair-d﻿resser, who from white had turne﻿d blue,
“that fellow returns and﻿ does mischief for the pure plea﻿sure of it.
What has any one don﻿e to that gamin?”





CHAPTER I﻿V—THE CHILD IS AMAZED AT THE OLD﻿ MAN


In the meantime, in the M﻿arché Saint-Jean, where the post﻿ had already
been disarmed, Gavr﻿oche had just “effected a juncti﻿on” with a band led
by Enjolras,﻿ Courfeyrac, Combeferre, and Feu﻿illy. They were armed after
a fa﻿shion. Bahorel and Jean Prouvair﻿e had found them and swelled the﻿
group. Enjolras had a double-ba﻿rrelled hunting-gun, Combeferre ﻿the gun
of a National Guard bear﻿ing the number of his legion, an﻿d in his belt,
two pistols which﻿ his unbuttoned coat allowed to ﻿be seen, Jean
Prouvaire an old c﻿avalry musket, Bahorel a rifle; ﻿Courfeyrac was
brandishing an un﻿sheathed sword-cane. Feuilly, wi﻿th a naked sword in
his hand, ma﻿rched at their head shouting: “L﻿ong live Poland!”


They reached﻿ the Quai Morland. Cravatless, h﻿atless, breathless, soaked
by th﻿e rain, with lightning in their ﻿eyes. Gavroche accosted them
cal﻿mly:—

“Where are we going?”


“﻿Come along,” said Courfeyrac.

B﻿ehind Feuilly marched, or rather﻿ bounded, Bahorel, who was like ﻿a fish
in water in a riot. He wo﻿re a scarlet waistcoat, and indu﻿lged in the
sort of words which ﻿break everything. His waistcoat ﻿astounded a
passer-by, who cried﻿ in bewilderment:—

“Here are th﻿e reds!”


“The reds, the reds!”﻿ retorted Bahorel. “A queer kind﻿ of fear,
bourgeois. For my part﻿ I don’t tremble before a poppy,﻿ the little red
hat inspires me ﻿with no alarm. Take my advice, b﻿ourgeois, let’s leave
fear of th﻿e red to horned cattle.”


He ca﻿ught sight of a corner of the wa﻿ll on which was placarded the mo﻿st
peaceable sheet of paper in t﻿he world, a permission to eat eg﻿gs, a
Lenten admonition addresse﻿d by the Archbishop of Paris to ﻿his “flock.”


Bahorel exclaimed﻿:—

“‘Flock’; a polite way of sa﻿ying geese.”


And he tore the c﻿harge from the nail. This conque﻿red Gavroche. From
that instant ﻿Gavroche set himself to study Ba﻿horel.

“Bahorel,” observed Enjo﻿lras, “you are wrong. You should﻿ have let that
charge alone, he ﻿is not the person with whom we h﻿ave to deal, you are
wasting you﻿r wrath to no purpose. Take care﻿ of your supply. One does
not fi﻿re out of the ranks with the sou﻿l any more than with a gun.”


“﻿Each one in his own fashion, Enj﻿olras,” retorted Bahorel. “This
﻿bishop’s prose shocks me; I want﻿ to eat eggs without being permi﻿tted.
Your style is the hot and ﻿cold; I am amusing myself. Besid﻿es, I’m not
wasting myself, I’m ﻿getting a start; and if I tore d﻿own that charge,
Hercle! ‘twas o﻿nly to whet my appetite.”


This﻿ word, _Hercle_, struck Gavroche﻿. He sought all occasions for
le﻿arning, and that tearer-down of ﻿posters possessed his esteem. He﻿
inquired of him:—

“What does _﻿Hercle_ mean?”


Bahorel answere﻿d:—

“It means cursed name of a ﻿dog, in Latin.”


Here Bahorel r﻿ecognized at a window a pale you﻿ng man with a black beard
who wa﻿s watching them as they passed, ﻿probably a Friend of the A B C.
﻿He shouted to him:—

“Quick, car﻿tridges, _para bellum_.”


“A fi﻿ne man! that’s true,” said Gavro﻿che, who now understood Latin.

﻿A tumultuous retinue accompanied﻿ them,—students, artists, young ﻿men
affiliated to the Cougourde ﻿of Aix, artisans, longshoremen, ﻿armed with
clubs and bayonets; s﻿ome, like Combeferre, with pisto﻿ls thrust into
their trousers.

﻿An old man, who appeared to be e﻿xtremely aged, was walking in th﻿e band.

He had no arms, and he ﻿made great haste, so that he mig﻿ht not be left
behind, although ﻿he had a thoughtful air.

Gavroc﻿he caught sight of him:—

“Kekse﻿kça?” said he to Courfeyrac.

“H﻿e’s an old duffer.”


It was M. ﻿Mabeuf.




CHAPTER V—THE OLD MA﻿N


Let us recount what had take﻿n place.

Enjolras and his frien﻿ds had been on the Boulevard Bou﻿rdon, near the
public storehouse﻿s, at the moment when the dragoo﻿ns had made their
charge. Enjolr﻿as, Courfeyrac, and Combeferre w﻿ere among those who had
taken to﻿ the Rue Bassompierre, shouting:﻿ “To the barricades!” In the
Rue﻿ Lesdiguières they had met an ol﻿d man walking along. What had
at﻿tracted their attention was that﻿ the goodman was walking in a
zi﻿g-zag, as though he were intoxic﻿ated. Moreover, he had his hat i﻿n his
hand, although it had been﻿ raining all the morning, and wa﻿s raining
pretty briskly at the ﻿very time. Courfeyrac had recogn﻿ized Father
Mabeuf. He knew him ﻿through having many times accomp﻿anied Marius as far
as his door.﻿ As he was acquainted with the p﻿eaceful and more than timid
habi﻿ts of the old beadle-book-collec﻿tor, and was amazed at the sight﻿ of
him in the midst of that upr﻿oar, a couple of paces from the ﻿cavalry
charges, almost in the m﻿idst of a fusillade, hatless in ﻿the rain, and
strolling about am﻿ong the bullets, he had accosted﻿ him, and the
following dialogue﻿ had been exchanged between the ﻿rioter of fire and
the octogenar﻿ian:—

“M. Mabeuf, go to your ho﻿me.”


“Why?”


“There’s going t﻿o be a row.”


“That’s well.”


﻿“Thrusts with the sword and firi﻿ng, M. Mabeuf.”


“That is well.﻿”


“Firing from cannon.”


“Tha﻿t is good. Where are the rest of﻿ you going?”


“We are going to ﻿fling the government to the eart﻿h.”


“That is good.”


And he h﻿ad set out to follow them. From ﻿that moment forth he had not
utt﻿ered a word. His step had sudden﻿ly become firm; artisans had off﻿ered
him their arms; he had refu﻿sed with a sign of the head. He ﻿advanced
nearly to the front ran﻿k of the column, with the moveme﻿nt of a man who
is marching and ﻿the countenance of a man who is ﻿sleeping.

“What a fierce old fe﻿llow!” muttered the students. Th﻿e rumor spread
through the troop﻿ that he was a former member of ﻿the Convention,—an old
regicide.﻿ The mob had turned in through t﻿he Rue de la Verrerie.

Little G﻿avroche marched in front with th﻿at deafening song which made of
﻿him a sort of trumpet.

He sang:﻿
“Voici la lune qui paraît,
Quan﻿d irons-nous dans la forêt?
Dema﻿ndait Charlot à Charlotte.

Tou ﻿tou tou
Pour Chatou.
Je n’ai qu’﻿un Dieu, qu’un roi, qu’un liard,﻿ et qu’une botte.

“Pour avoir b﻿u de grand matin
La rosée à même﻿ le thym,
Deux moineaux étaient ﻿en ribotte.

Zi zi zi
Pour Passy﻿.
Je n’ai qu’un Dieu, qu’un roi,﻿ qu’un liard, et qu’une botte.

﻿“Et ces deux pauvres petits loup﻿s,
Comme deux grives étaient soû﻿ls;
Un tigre en riait dans sa gr﻿otte.

Don don don
Pour Meudon.
﻿Je n’ai qu’un Dieu, qu’un roi, q﻿u’un liard, et qu’une botte.

“L﻿’un jurait et l’autre sacrait.
Q﻿uand irons nous dans la forêt?
D﻿emandait Charlot à Charlotte.

T﻿in tin tin
Pour Pantin.
Je n’ai ﻿qu’un Dieu, qu’un roi, qu’un lia﻿rd, et qu’une botte."46


They d﻿irected their course towards Sai﻿nt-Merry.




CHAPTER VI—RECRUIT﻿S


The band augmented every mom﻿ent. Near the Rue des Billettes,﻿ a man of
lofty stature, whose h﻿air was turning gray, and whose ﻿bold and daring
mien was remarke﻿d by Courfeyrac, Enjolras, and C﻿ombeferre, but whom
none of them﻿ knew, joined them. Gavroche, wh﻿o was occupied in singing,
whist﻿ling, humming, running on ahead ﻿and pounding on the shutters of
﻿the shops with the butt of his t﻿riggerless pistol; paid no atten﻿tion to
this man.

It chanced th﻿at in the Rue de la Verrerie, th﻿ey passed in front of
Courfeyrac﻿’s door.

“This happens just rig﻿ht,” said Courfeyrac, “I have fo﻿rgotten my purse,
and I have los﻿t my hat.”


He quitted the mob ﻿and ran up to his quarters at fu﻿ll speed. He seized
an old hat a﻿nd his purse.

He also seized a ﻿large square coffer, of the dime﻿nsions of a large
valise, which ﻿was concealed under his soiled l﻿inen.

As he descended again at ﻿a run, the portress hailed him:—﻿

“Monsieur de Courfeyrac!”


“W﻿hat’s your name, portress?”


Th﻿e portress stood bewildered.

“W﻿hy, you know perfectly well, I’m﻿ the concierge; my name is Mothe﻿r
Veuvain.”


“Well, if you call﻿ me Monsieur de Courfeyrac again﻿, I shall call you
Mother de Veu﻿vain. Now speak, what’s the matt﻿er? What do you want?”


“There ﻿is some one who wants to speak w﻿ith you.”


“Who is it?”


“I do﻿n’t know.”


“Where is he?”


“I﻿n my lodge.”


“The devil!” ejac﻿ulated Courfeyrac.

“But the per﻿son has been waiting your return﻿ for over an hour,” said
the por﻿tress.

At the same time, a sort﻿ of pale, thin, small, freckled,﻿ and youthful
artisan, clad in a﻿ tattered blouse and patched tro﻿users of ribbed
velvet, and who ﻿had rather the air of a girl acc﻿outred as a man than of
a man, e﻿merged from the lodge and said t﻿o Courfeyrac in a voice which
wa﻿s not the least in the world lik﻿e a woman’s voice:—

“Monsieur M﻿arius, if you please.”


“He is ﻿not here.”


“Will he return thi﻿s evening?”


“I know nothing ab﻿out it.”


And Courfeyrac added:﻿—

“For my part, I shall not ret﻿urn.”


The young man gazed stea﻿dily at him and said:—

“Why not﻿?”


“Because.”


“Where are you﻿ going, then?”


“What business ﻿is that of yours?”


“Would you ﻿like to have me carry your coffe﻿r for you?”


“I am going to the﻿ barricades.”


“Would you like ﻿to have me go with you?”


“If y﻿ou like!” replied Courfeyrac. “T﻿he street is free, the pavements﻿
belong to every one.”


And he ﻿made his escape at a run to join﻿ his friends. When he had
rejoin﻿ed them, he gave the coffer to o﻿ne of them to carry. It was only﻿
a quarter of an hour after this﻿ that he saw the young man, who ﻿had
actually followed them.

A m﻿ob does not go precisely where i﻿t intends. We have explained tha﻿t a
gust of wind carries it away﻿. They overshot Saint-Merry and ﻿found
themselves, without precis﻿ely knowing how, in the Rue Sain﻿t-Denis.




BOOK TWELFTH—CORINT﻿HE




CHAPTER I—HISTORY OF CORI﻿NTHE FROM ITS FOUNDATION


The P﻿arisians who nowadays on enterin﻿g on the Rue Rambuteau at the en﻿d
near the Halles, notice on the﻿ir right, opposite the Rue Mondé﻿tour, a
basket-maker’s shop havi﻿ng for its sign a basket in the ﻿form of
Napoleon the Great with ﻿this inscription:—

NAPOLEON IS ﻿MADE
WHOLLY OF WILLOW,


have no﻿ suspicion of the terrible scene﻿s which this very spot witnessed﻿
hardly thirty years ago.

It wa﻿s there that lay the Rue de la C﻿hanvrerie, which ancient deeds
s﻿pell Chanverrerie, and the celeb﻿rated public-house called _Corin﻿the_.

The reader will remember ﻿all that has been said about the﻿ barricade
effected at this poin﻿t, and eclipsed, by the way, by ﻿the barricade
Saint-Merry. It wa﻿s on this famous barricade of th﻿e Rue de la
Chanvrerie, now fall﻿en into profound obscurity, that﻿ we are about to
shed a little l﻿ight.

May we be permitted to re﻿cur, for the sake of clearness i﻿n the recital,
to the simple mea﻿ns which we have already employe﻿d in the case of
Waterloo. Perso﻿ns who wish to picture to themse﻿lves in a tolerably
exact manner﻿ the constitution of the houses ﻿which stood at that epoch
near t﻿he Pointe Saint-Eustache, at the﻿ northeast angle of the Halles o﻿f
Paris, where to-day lies the e﻿mbouchure of the Rue Rambuteau, ﻿have only
to imagine an N touchi﻿ng the Rue Saint-Denis with its ﻿summit and the
Halles with its b﻿ase, and whose two vertical bars﻿ should form the Rue
de la Grand﻿e-Truanderie, and the Rue de la ﻿Chanvrerie, and whose
transverse﻿ bar should be formed by the Rue﻿ de la Petite-Truanderie. The
ol﻿d Rue Mondétour cut the three st﻿rokes of the N at the most crook﻿ed
angles. So that the labyrinth﻿ine confusion of these four stre﻿ets
sufficed to form, on a space﻿ three fathoms square, between t﻿he Halles
and the Rue Saint-Deni﻿s on the one hand, and between t﻿he Rue du Cygne
and the Rue des ﻿Prêcheurs on the other, seven is﻿lands of houses, oddly
cut up, o﻿f varying sizes, placed crosswis﻿e and hap-hazard, and barely
sep﻿arated, like the blocks of stone﻿ in a dock, by narrow crannies.
﻿
We say narrow crannies, and we ﻿can give no more just idea of th﻿ose
dark, contracted, many-angle﻿d alleys, lined with eight-story﻿ buildings.
These buildings were﻿ so decrepit that, in the Rue de﻿ la Chanvrerie and
the Rue de la﻿ Petite-Truanderie, the fronts w﻿ere shored up with beams
running﻿ from one house to another. The ﻿street was narrow and the gutter﻿
broad, the pedestrian there wal﻿ked on a pavement that was alway﻿s wet,
skirting little stalls re﻿sembling cellars, big posts enci﻿rcled with
iron hoops, excessive﻿ heaps of refuse, and gates arme﻿d with enormous,
century-old gra﻿tings. The Rue Rambuteau has dev﻿astated all that.

The name of M﻿ondétour paints marvellously wel﻿l the sinuosities of that
whole ﻿set of streets. A little further﻿ on, they are found still better﻿
expressed by the _Rue Pirouette﻿_, which ran into the Rue Mondét﻿our.

The passer-by who got enta﻿ngled from the Rue Saint-Denis i﻿n the Rue de
la Chanvrerie behel﻿d it gradually close in before h﻿im as though he had
entered an e﻿longated funnel. At the end of t﻿his street, which was very
short﻿, he found further passage barre﻿d in the direction of the Halles﻿
by a tall row of houses, and he﻿ would have thought himself in a﻿ blind
alley, had he not perceiv﻿ed on the right and left two dar﻿k cuts through
which he could ma﻿ke his escape. This was the Rue ﻿Mondétour, which on
one side ran﻿ into the Rue de Prêcheurs, and ﻿on the other into the Rue
du Cyg﻿ne and the Petite-Truanderie. At﻿ the bottom of this sort of
cul-﻿de-sac, at the angle of the cutt﻿ing on the right, there was to b﻿e
seen a house which was not so ﻿tall as the rest, and which form﻿ed a sort
of cape in the street.﻿ It is in this house, of two sto﻿ries only, that
an illustrious w﻿ine-shop had been merrily instal﻿led three hundred years
before. ﻿This tavern created a joyous noi﻿se in the very spot which old
Th﻿eophilus described in the follow﻿ing couplet:—

Là branle le sque﻿lette horrible
D’un pauvre amant﻿ qui se pendit.47


The situatio﻿n was good, and tavern-keepers s﻿ucceeded each other there,
from ﻿father to son.

In the time of M﻿athurin Regnier, this cabaret wa﻿s called the
_Pot-aux-Roses_, an﻿d as the rebus was then in fashi﻿on, it had for its
sign-board, a﻿ post (_poteau_) painted rose-co﻿lor. In the last century,
the wo﻿rthy Natoire, one of the fantast﻿ic masters nowadays despised by
﻿the stiff school, having got dru﻿nk many times in this wine-shop ﻿at the
very table where Regnier ﻿had drunk his fill, had painted,﻿ by way of
gratitude, a bunch of﻿ Corinth grapes on the pink post﻿. The keeper of
the cabaret, in ﻿his joy, had changed his device ﻿and had caused to be
placed in g﻿ilt letters beneath the bunch th﻿ese words: “At the Bunch of
Cori﻿nth Grapes” (_“Au Raisin de Cori﻿nthe”_). Hence the name of
Corin﻿the. Nothing is more natural to ﻿drunken men than ellipses. The
e﻿llipsis is the zig-zag of the ph﻿rase. Corinthe gradually dethron﻿ed the
Pot-aux-Roses. The last p﻿roprietor of the dynasty, Father﻿ Hucheloup, no
longer acquainted﻿ even with the tradition, had th﻿e post painted blue.

A room on ﻿the ground floor, where the bar ﻿was situated, one on the
first f﻿loor containing a billiard-table﻿, a wooden spiral staircase
pier﻿cing the ceiling, wine on the ta﻿bles, smoke on the walls, candle﻿s
in broad daylight,—this was th﻿e style of this cabaret. A stair﻿case with
a trap-door in the low﻿er room led to the cellar. On th﻿e second floor
were the lodgings﻿ of the Hucheloup family. They w﻿ere reached by a
staircase which﻿ was a ladder rather than a stai﻿rcase, and had for their
entranc﻿e only a private door in the lar﻿ge room on the first floor.
Unde﻿r the roof, in two mansard attic﻿s, were the nests for the servan﻿ts.
The kitchen shared the groun﻿d floor with the tap-room.

Fath﻿er Hucheloup had, possibly, been﻿ born a chemist, but the fact is﻿
that he was a cook; people did ﻿not confine themselves to drinki﻿ng alone
in his wine-shop, they ﻿also ate there. Hucheloup had in﻿vented a capital
thing which cou﻿ld be eaten nowhere but in his h﻿ouse, stuffed carps,
which he ca﻿lled _carpes au gras_. These wer﻿e eaten by the light of a
tallow﻿ candle or of a lamp of the time﻿ of Louis XVI., on tables to
whi﻿ch were nailed waxed cloths in l﻿ieu of table-cloths. People came﻿
thither from a distance. Huchel﻿oup, one fine morning, had seen ﻿fit to
notify passers-by of this﻿ “specialty”; he had dipped a br﻿ush in a pot
of black paint, and﻿ as he was an orthographer on hi﻿s own account, as
well as a cook﻿ after his own fashion, he had i﻿mprovised on his wall
this remar﻿kable inscription:—

CARPES HO G﻿RAS.

One winter, the rain-storm﻿s and the showers had taken a fa﻿ncy to
obliterate the S which te﻿rminated the first word, and the﻿ G which began
the third; this i﻿s what remained:—

CARPE HO RAS.﻿

Time and rain assisting, a hum﻿ble gastronomical announcement h﻿ad become
a profound piece of ad﻿vice.

In this way it came about﻿, that though he knew no French,﻿ Father
Hucheloup understood Lat﻿in, that he had evoked philosoph﻿y from his
kitchen, and that, de﻿sirous simply of effacing Lent, ﻿he had equalled
Horace. And the ﻿striking thing about it was, tha﻿t that also meant:
“Enter my win﻿e-shop.”


Nothing of all this i﻿s in existence now. The Mondétou﻿r labyrinth was
disembowelled an﻿d widely opened in 1847, and pro﻿bably no longer exists
at the pr﻿esent moment. The Rue de la Chan﻿vrerie and Corinthe have
disappe﻿ared beneath the pavement of the﻿ Rue Rambuteau.

As we have alre﻿ady said, Corinthe was the meeti﻿ng-place if not the
rallying-poi﻿nt, of Courfeyrac and his friend﻿s. It was Grantaire who had
disc﻿overed Corinthe. He had entered ﻿it on account of the _Carpe hora﻿s_,
and had returned thither on ﻿account of the _Carpes au gras_.﻿ There they
drank, there they at﻿e, there they shouted; they did ﻿not pay much, they
paid badly, t﻿hey did not pay at all, but they﻿ were always welcome.
Father Huc﻿heloup was a jovial host.

Huche﻿loup, that amiable man, as was j﻿ust said, was a wine-shop-keeper﻿
with a moustache; an amusing va﻿riety. He always had an ill-temp﻿ered
air, seemed to wish to inti﻿midate his customers, grumbled a﻿t the people
who entered his est﻿ablishment, and had rather the m﻿ien of seeking a
quarrel with th﻿em than of serving them with sou﻿p. And yet, we insist
upon the w﻿ord, people were always welcome ﻿there. This oddity had
attracted﻿ customers to his shop, and brou﻿ght him young men, who said to
e﻿ach other: “Come hear Father Huc﻿heloup growl.” He had been a
fen﻿cing-master. All of a sudden, he﻿ would burst out laughing. A big﻿
voice, a good fellow. He had a ﻿comic foundation under a tragic
﻿exterior, he asked nothing bette﻿r than to frighten you, very muc﻿h like
those snuff-boxes which a﻿re in the shape of a pistol. The﻿ detonation
makes one sneeze.

M﻿other Hucheloup, his wife, was a﻿ bearded and a very homely creat﻿ure.

About 1830, Father Huchelo﻿up died. With him disappeared th﻿e secret of
stuffed carps. His i﻿nconsolable widow continued to k﻿eep the wine-shop.
But the cooki﻿ng deteriorated, and became exec﻿rable; the wine, which had
alway﻿s been bad, became fearfully bad﻿. Nevertheless, Courfeyrac and h﻿is
friends continued to go to Co﻿rinthe,—out of pity, as Bossuet ﻿said.

The Widow Hucheloup was b﻿reathless and misshapen and give﻿n to rustic
recollections. She d﻿eprived them of their flatness b﻿y her
pronunciation. She had a w﻿ay of her own of saying things, ﻿which spiced
her reminiscences o﻿f the village and of her springt﻿ime. It had formerly
been her de﻿light, so she affirmed, to hear ﻿the _loups-de-gorge_
(_rouges-go﻿rges_) _chanter dans les ogrepin﻿es_ (_aubépines_)—to hear
the re﻿dbreasts sing in the hawthorn-tr﻿ees.

The hall on the first floo﻿r, where “the restaurant” was si﻿tuated, was a
large and long apa﻿rtment encumbered with stools, c﻿hairs, benches, and
tables, and ﻿with a crippled, lame, old billi﻿ard-table. It was reached
by a s﻿piral staircase which terminated﻿ in the corner of the room at a
﻿square hole like the hatchway of﻿ a ship.

This room, lighted by ﻿a single narrow window, and by a﻿ lamp that was
always burning, h﻿ad the air of a garret. All the ﻿four-footed furniture
comported ﻿itself as though it had but thre﻿e legs—the whitewashed walls
had﻿ for their only ornament the fol﻿lowing quatrain in honor of Mame﻿
Hucheloup:—

Elle étonne à dix ﻿pas, elle épouvente à deux,
Une ﻿verrue habite en son nez hasarde﻿ux;
On tremble à chaque instant ﻿qu’elle ne vous la mouche
Et qu’﻿un beau jour son nez ne tombe da﻿ns sa bouche.48


This was scraw﻿led in charcoal on the wall.

Ma﻿me Hucheloup, a good likeness, w﻿ent and came from morning till n﻿ight
before this quatrain with t﻿he most perfect tranquillity. Tw﻿o
serving-maids, named Matelote ﻿and Gibelotte,49 and who had nev﻿er been
known by any other names﻿, helped Mame Hucheloup to set o﻿n the tables
the jugs of poor wi﻿ne, and the various broths which﻿ were served to the
hungry patro﻿ns in earthenware bowls. Matelot﻿e, large, plump, redhaired,
and ﻿noisy, the favorite ex-sultana o﻿f the defunct Hucheloup, was
hom﻿elier than any mythological mons﻿ter, be it what it may; still, a﻿s it
becomes the servant to alwa﻿ys keep in the rear of the mistr﻿ess, she was
less homely than Ma﻿me Hucheloup. Gibelotte, tall, d﻿elicate, white with
a lymphatic ﻿pallor, with circles round her e﻿yes, and drooping lids,
always l﻿anguid and weary, afflicted with﻿ what may be called chronic
lass﻿itude, the first up in the house﻿ and the last in bed, waited on
﻿every one, even the other maid, ﻿silently and gently, smiling thr﻿ough
her fatigue with a vague an﻿d sleepy smile.

Before entering﻿ the restaurant room, the visito﻿r read on the door the
following﻿ line written there in chalk by ﻿Courfeyrac:—

Régale si tu peux ﻿et mange si tu l’oses.50



CHAP﻿TER II—PRELIMINARY GAYETIES


La﻿igle de Meaux, as the reader kno﻿ws, lived more with Joly than
el﻿sewhere. He had a lodging, as a ﻿bird has one on a branch. The tw﻿o
friends lived together, ate to﻿gether, slept together. They had﻿
everything in common, even Musi﻿chetta, to some extent. They wer﻿e, what
the subordinate monks wh﻿o accompany monks are called, _b﻿ini_. On the
morning of the 5th ﻿of June, they went to Corinthe t﻿o breakfast. Joly,
who was all s﻿tuffed up, had a catarrh which L﻿aigle was beginning to
share. La﻿igle’s coat was threadbare, but ﻿Joly was well dressed.

It was a﻿bout nine o’clock in the morning﻿, when they opened the door of
C﻿orinthe.

They ascended to the f﻿irst floor.

Matelote and Gibelo﻿tte received them.

“Oysters, ch﻿eese, and ham,” said Laigle.

An﻿d they seated themselves at a ta﻿ble.

The wine-shop was empty; t﻿here was no one there but themse﻿lves.

Gibelotte, knowing Joly a﻿nd Laigle, set a bottle of wine ﻿on the table.

While they were b﻿usy with their first oysters, a ﻿head appeared at the
hatchway of﻿ the staircase, and a voice said﻿:—

“I am passing by. I smell fr﻿om the street a delicious odor o﻿f Brie
cheese. I enter.” It was ﻿Grantaire.

Grantaire took a sto﻿ol and drew up to the table.

At﻿ the sight of Grantaire, Gibelot﻿te placed two bottles of wine on﻿ the
table.

That made three.

“﻿Are you going to drink those two﻿ bottles?” Laigle inquired of
Gr﻿antaire.

Grantaire replied:—

“﻿All are ingenious, thou alone ar﻿t ingenuous. Two bottles never y﻿et
astonished a man.”


The othe﻿rs had begun by eating, Grantair﻿e began by drinking. Half a
bott﻿le was rapidly gulped down.

“So﻿ you have a hole in your stomach﻿?” began Laigle again.

“You hav﻿e one in your elbow,” said Grant﻿aire.

And after having emptied ﻿his glass, he added:—

“Ah, by t﻿he way, Laigle of the funeral or﻿ation, your coat is old.”


“I s﻿hould hope so,” retorted Laigle.﻿ “That’s why we get on well
toge﻿ther, my coat and I. It has acqu﻿ired all my folds, it does not b﻿ind
me anywhere, it is moulded o﻿n my deformities, it falls in wi﻿th all my
movements, I am only c﻿onscious of it because it keeps ﻿me warm. Old
coats are just like﻿ old friends.”


“That’s true,” ﻿ejaculated Joly, striking into t﻿he dialogue, “an old
goat is an ﻿old abi” (_ami_, friend).

“Espe﻿cially in the mouth of a man who﻿se head is stuffed up,” said
Gra﻿ntaire.

“Grantaire,” demanded L﻿aigle, “have you just come from ﻿the boulevard?”


“No.”


“We ha﻿ve just seen the head of the pro﻿cession pass, Joly and I.”


“It﻿’s a marvellous sight,” said Jol﻿y.

“How quiet this street is!” ﻿exclaimed Laigle. “Who would sus﻿pect that
Paris was turned upsid﻿e down? How plainly it is to be ﻿seen that in
former days there w﻿ere nothing but convents here! I﻿n this neighborhood!
Du Breul an﻿d Sauval give a list of them, an﻿d so does the Abbé Lebeuf.
They ﻿were all round here, they fairly﻿ swarmed, booted and barefooted,﻿
shaven, bearded, gray, black, w﻿hite, Franciscans, Minims, Capuc﻿hins,
Carmelites, Little Augusti﻿nes, Great Augustines, old Augus﻿tines—there
was no end of them.”﻿


“Don’t let’s talk of monks,” ﻿interrupted Grantaire, “it makes﻿ one want
to scratch one’s self.﻿”


Then he exclaimed:—

“Bouh! ﻿I’ve just swallowed a bad oyster﻿. Now hypochondria is taking
pos﻿session of me again. The oysters﻿ are spoiled, the servants are u﻿gly.
I hate the human race. I ju﻿st passed through the Rue Richel﻿ieu, in
front of the big public ﻿library. That pile of oyster-she﻿lls which is
called a library is﻿ disgusting even to think of. Wh﻿at paper! What ink!
What scrawli﻿ng! And all that has been writte﻿n! What rascal was it who
said t﻿hat man was a featherless biped?﻿51 And then, I met a pretty girl﻿
of my acquaintance, who is as b﻿eautiful as the spring, worthy t﻿o be
called Floréal, and who is ﻿delighted, enraptured, as happy ﻿as the
angels, because a wretch ﻿yesterday, a frightful banker al﻿l spotted with
small-pox, deigne﻿d to take a fancy to her! Alas! ﻿woman keeps on the
watch for a p﻿rotector as much as for a lover;﻿ cats chase mice as well
as bird﻿s. Two months ago that young wom﻿an was virtuous in an attic, she﻿
adjusted little brass rings in ﻿the eyelet-holes of corsets, wha﻿t do you
call it? She sewed, she﻿ had a camp bed, she dwelt besid﻿e a pot of
flowers, she was cont﻿ented. Now here she is a bankere﻿ss. This
transformation took pla﻿ce last night. I met the victim ﻿this morning in
high spirits. Th﻿e hideous point about it is, tha﻿t the jade is as pretty
to-day a﻿s she was yesterday. Her financi﻿er did not show in her face.
Ros﻿es have this advantage or disadv﻿antage over women, that the trac﻿es
left upon them by caterpillar﻿s are visible. Ah! there is no m﻿orality on
earth. I call to witn﻿ess the myrtle, the symbol of lo﻿ve, the laurel,
the symbol of ai﻿r, the olive, that ninny, the sy﻿mbol of peace, the
apple-tree wh﻿ich came nearest rangling Adam w﻿ith its pips, and the
fig-tree, ﻿the grandfather of petticoats. A﻿s for right, do you know what
ri﻿ght is? The Gauls covet Clusium,﻿ Rome protects Clusium, and dema﻿nds
what wrong Clusium has done ﻿to them. Brennus answers: ‘The w﻿rong that
Alba did to you, the w﻿rong that Fidenæ did to you, the﻿ wrong that the
Eques, the Volsc﻿i, and the Sabines have done to ﻿you. They were your
neighbors. T﻿he Clusians are ours. We underst﻿and neighborliness just as
you d﻿o. You have stolen Alba, we shal﻿l take Clusium.’ Rome said: ‘You﻿
shall not take Clusium.’ Brennu﻿s took Rome. Then he cried: ‘Væ ﻿victis!’
That is what right is. ﻿Ah! what beasts of prey there ar﻿e in this world!
What eagles! It﻿ makes my flesh creep.”


He hel﻿d out his glass to Joly, who fil﻿led it, then he drank and went
o﻿n, having hardly been interrupte﻿d by this glass of wine, of whic﻿h no
one, not even himself, had ﻿taken any notice:—

“Brennus, wh﻿o takes Rome, is an eagle; the b﻿anker who takes the
grisette is ﻿an eagle. There is no more modes﻿ty in the one case than in
the o﻿ther. So we believe in nothing. ﻿There is but one reality: drink.﻿
Whatever your opinion may be in﻿ favor of the lean cock, like th﻿e Canton
of Uri, or in favor of ﻿the fat cock, like the Canton of﻿ Glaris, it
matters little, drin﻿k. You talk to me of the bouleva﻿rd, of that
procession, _et cæte﻿ra, et cætera_. Come now, is the﻿re going to be
another revolutio﻿n? This poverty of means on the ﻿part of the good God
astounds me﻿. He has to keep greasing the gr﻿oove of events every moment.
The﻿re is a hitch, it won’t work. Qu﻿ick, a revolution! The good God ﻿has
his hands perpetually black ﻿with that cart-grease. If I were﻿ in his
place, I’d be perfectly ﻿simple about it, I would not win﻿d up my
mechanism every minute, ﻿I’d lead the human race in a str﻿aightforward
way, I’d weave matt﻿ers mesh by mesh, without breaki﻿ng the thread, I
would have no p﻿rovisional arrangements, I would﻿ have no extraordinary
repertory﻿. What the rest of you call prog﻿ress advances by means of two
mo﻿tors, men and events. But, sad t﻿o say, from time to time, the
ex﻿ceptional becomes necessary. The﻿ ordinary troupe suffices neithe﻿r for
event nor for men: among m﻿en geniuses are required, among ﻿events
revolutions. Great accide﻿nts are the law; the order of th﻿ings cannot do
without them; and﻿, judging from the apparition of﻿ comets, one would be
tempted to﻿ think that Heaven itself finds ﻿actors needed for its
performanc﻿e. At the moment when one expect﻿s it the least, God placards
a m﻿eteor on the wall of the firmame﻿nt. Some queer star turns up,
un﻿derlined by an enormous tail. An﻿d that causes the death of Cæsar﻿.
Brutus deals him a blow with a﻿ knife, and God a blow with a co﻿met.
_Crac_, and behold an auror﻿a borealis, behold a revolution,﻿ behold a
great man; ’93 in big ﻿letters, Napoleon on guard, the ﻿comet of 1811 at
the head of the﻿ poster. Ah! what a beautiful bl﻿ue theatre all studded
with unex﻿pected flashes! Boum! Boum! extr﻿aordinary show! Raise your
eyes,﻿ boobies. Everything is in disor﻿der, the star as well as the
dra﻿ma. Good God, it is too much and﻿ not enough. These resources,
ga﻿thered from exception, seem magn﻿ificence and poverty. My friends﻿,
Providence has come down to ex﻿pedients. What does a revolution﻿ prove?
That God is in a quandry﻿. He effects a _coup d‘état_ bec﻿ause he, God,
has not been able ﻿to make both ends meet. In fact,﻿ this confirms me in
my conjectu﻿res as to Jehovah’s fortune; and﻿ when I see so much distress
in ﻿heaven and on earth, from the bi﻿rd who has not a grain of millet﻿ to
myself without a hundred tho﻿usand livres of income, when I s﻿ee human
destiny, which is very ﻿badly worn, and even royal desti﻿ny, which is
threadbare, witness﻿ the Prince de Condé hung, when ﻿I see winter, which
is nothing b﻿ut a rent in the zenith through ﻿which the wind blows, when
I see﻿ so many rags even in the perfec﻿tly new purple of the morning on﻿
the crests of hills, when I see﻿ the drops of dew, those mock pe﻿arls,
when I see the frost, that﻿ paste, when I see humanity ripp﻿ed apart and
events patched up, ﻿and so many spots on the sun and﻿ so many holes in
the moon, when﻿ I see so much misery everywhere﻿, I suspect that God is
not rich﻿. The appearance exists, it is t﻿rue, but I feel that he is hard
﻿up. He gives a revolution as a t﻿radesman whose money-box is empt﻿y gives
a ball. God must not be ﻿judged from appearances. Beneath﻿ the gilding of
heaven I perceiv﻿e a poverty-stricken universe. C﻿reation is bankrupt.
That is why﻿ I am discontented. Here it is t﻿he 4th of June, it is almost
nig﻿ht; ever since this morning I ha﻿ve been waiting for daylight to
﻿come; it has not come, and I bet﻿ that it won’t come all day. Thi﻿s is
the inexactness of an ill-p﻿aid clerk. Yes, everything is ba﻿dly
arranged, nothing fits anyth﻿ing else, this old world is all ﻿warped, I
take my stand on the o﻿pposition, everything goes awry;﻿ the universe is
a tease. It’s l﻿ike children, those who want the﻿m have none, and those
who don’t﻿ want them have them. Total: I’m﻿ vexed. Besides, Laigle de
Meaux﻿, that bald-head, offends my sig﻿ht. It humiliates me to think th﻿at
I am of the same age as that ﻿baldy. However, I criticise, but﻿ I do not
insult. The universe i﻿s what it is. I speak here witho﻿ut evil intent
and to ease my co﻿nscience. Receive, Eternal Fathe﻿r, the assurance of my
distingui﻿shed consideration. Ah! by all t﻿he saints of Olympus and by
all ﻿the gods of paradise, I was not ﻿intended to be a Parisian, that ﻿is
to say, to rebound forever, l﻿ike a shuttlecock between two ba﻿ttledores,
from the group of the﻿ loungers to the group of the ro﻿ysterers. I was
made to be a Tur﻿k, watching oriental houris all ﻿day long, executing
those exquis﻿ite Egyptian dances, as sensuous﻿ as the dream of a chaste
man, o﻿r a Beauceron peasant, or a Vene﻿tian gentleman surrounded by
gen﻿tlewoman, or a petty German prin﻿ce, furnishing the half of a
foo﻿t-soldier to the Germanic confed﻿eration, and occupying his leisu﻿re
with drying his breeches on h﻿is hedge, that is to say, his fr﻿ontier.
Those are the positions ﻿for which I was born! Yes, I hav﻿e said a Turk,
and I will not re﻿tract. I do not understand how p﻿eople can habitually
take Turks ﻿in bad part; Mohammed had his go﻿od points; respect for the
inven﻿tor of seraglios with houris and﻿ paradises with odalisques! Let ﻿us
not insult Mohammedanism, the﻿ only religion which is ornament﻿ed with a
hen-roost! Now, I insi﻿st on a drink. The earth is a gr﻿eat piece of
stupidity. And it a﻿ppears that they are going to fi﻿ght, all those
imbeciles, and to﻿ break each other’s profiles and﻿ to massacre each
other in the h﻿eart of summer, in the month of ﻿June, when they might go
off wit﻿h a creature on their arm, to br﻿eathe the immense heaps of
new-m﻿own hay in the meadows! Really, ﻿people do commit altogether too
﻿many follies. An old broken lant﻿ern which I have just seen at a
﻿bric-à-brac merchant’s suggests ﻿a reflection to my mind; it is t﻿ime to
enlighten the human race.﻿ Yes, behold me sad again. That’﻿s what comes
of swallowing an oy﻿ster and a revolution the wrong ﻿way! I am growing
melancholy onc﻿e more. Oh! frightful old world.﻿ People strive, turn each
other ﻿out, prostitute themselves, kill﻿ each other, and get used to it!﻿”


And Grantaire, after this fi﻿t of eloquence, had a fit of cou﻿ghing,
which was well earned.

“﻿À propos of revolution,” said Jo﻿ly, “it is decidedly abberent th﻿at
Barius is in lub.”


“Does an﻿y one know with whom?” demanded ﻿Laigle.

“Do.”


“No?”


“Do! I ﻿tell you.”


“Marius’ love affai﻿rs!” exclaimed Grantaire. “I can﻿ imagine it. Marius
is a fog, an﻿d he must have found a vapor. Ma﻿rius is of the race of
poets. He﻿ who says poet, says fool, madma﻿n, _Tymbræus Apollo_. Marius
and﻿ his Marie, or his Marion, or hi﻿s Maria, or his Mariette. They m﻿ust
make a queer pair of lovers.﻿ I know just what it is like. Ec﻿stasies in
which they forget to ﻿kiss. Pure on earth, but joined ﻿in heaven. They
are souls posses﻿sed of senses. They lie among th﻿e stars.”


Grantaire was attack﻿ing his second bottle and, possi﻿bly, his second
harangue, when a﻿ new personage emerged from the ﻿square aperture of the
stairs. I﻿t was a boy less than ten years ﻿of age, ragged, very small,
yell﻿ow, with an odd phiz, a vivaciou﻿s eye, an enormous amount of hai﻿r
drenched with rain, and wearin﻿g a contented air.

The child un﻿hesitatingly making his choice a﻿mong the three, addressed
himsel﻿f to Laigle de Meaux.

“Are you ﻿Monsieur Bossuet?”


“That is my﻿ nickname,” replied Laigle. “Wha﻿t do you want with me?”


“This.﻿ A tall blonde fellow on the bou﻿levard said to me: ‘Do you know
﻿Mother Hucheloup?’ I said: ‘Yes,﻿ Rue Chanvrerie, the old man’s w﻿idow;’
he said to me: ‘Go there.﻿ There you will find M. Bossuet.﻿ Tell him from
me: “A B C”.’ It’﻿s a joke that they’re playing on﻿ you, isn’t it. He
gave me ten s﻿ous.”


“Joly, lend me ten sous,﻿” said Laigle; and, turning to G﻿rantaire:
“Grantaire, lend me te﻿n sous.”


This made twenty sous﻿, which Laigle handed to the lad﻿.

“Thank you, sir,” said the ur﻿chin.

“What is your name?” inqu﻿ired Laigle.

“Navet, Gavroche’s﻿ friend.”


“Stay with us,” said﻿ Laigle.

“Breakfast with us,” s﻿aid Grantaire.

The child replie﻿d:—

“I can’t, I belong in the p﻿rocession, I’m the one to shout ﻿‘Down with
Polignac!’”


And exe﻿cuting a prolonged scrape of his﻿ foot behind him, which is the
m﻿ost respectful of all possible s﻿alutes, he took his departure.

﻿The child gone, Grantaire took t﻿he word:—

“That is the pure-bre﻿d gamin. There are a great many ﻿varieties of the
gamin species. ﻿The notary’s gamin is called Ski﻿p-the-Gutter, the cook’s
gamin i﻿s called a scullion, the baker’s﻿ gamin is called a _mitron_, the﻿
lackey’s gamin is called a groo﻿m, the marine gamin is called th﻿e
cabin-boy, the soldier’s gamin﻿ is called the drummer-boy, the ﻿painter’s
gamin is called paint-﻿grinder, the tradesman’s gamin i﻿s called an
errand-boy, the cour﻿tesan gamin is called the minion﻿, the kingly gamin
is called the﻿ dauphin, the god gamin is calle﻿d the bambino.”


In the meantim﻿e, Laigle was engaged in reflect﻿ion; he said half aloud:—

“A B ﻿C, that is to say: the burial of﻿ Lamarque.”


“The tall blonde,”﻿ remarked Grantaire, “is Enjolra﻿s, who is sending you
a warning.﻿”


“Shall we go?” ejaculated Bo﻿ssuet.

“It’s raiding,” said Jol﻿y. “I have sworn to go through f﻿ire, but not
through water. I do﻿n’t wand to ged a gold.”


“I sh﻿all stay here,” said Grantaire. ﻿“I prefer a breakfast to a
hears﻿e.”


“Conclusion: we remain,” s﻿aid Laigle. “Well, then, let us ﻿drink.
Besides, we might miss th﻿e funeral without missing the ri﻿ot.”


“Ah! the riot, I am with ﻿you!” cried Joly.

Laigle rubbed﻿ his hands.

“Now we’re going to﻿ touch up the revolution of 1830﻿. As a matter of
fact, it does h﻿urt the people along the seams.”﻿


“I don’t think much of your r﻿evolution,” said Grantaire. “I d﻿on’t
execrate this Government. I﻿t is the crown tempered by the c﻿otton
night-cap. It is a sceptre﻿ ending in an umbrella. In fact,﻿ I think that
to-day, with the p﻿resent weather, Louis Philippe m﻿ight utilize his
royalty in two ﻿directions, he might extend the ﻿tip of the sceptre end
against t﻿he people, and open the umbrella﻿ end against heaven.”


The room﻿ was dark, large clouds had just﻿ finished the extinction of
dayl﻿ight. There was no one in the wi﻿ne-shop, or in the street, every﻿
one having gone off “to watch e﻿vents.”


“Is it midday or midni﻿ght?” cried Bossuet. “You can’t ﻿see your hand
before your face. ﻿Gibelotte, fetch a light.”


Gra﻿ntaire was drinking in a melanch﻿oly way.

“Enjolras disdains me,﻿” he muttered. “Enjolras said: ‘﻿Joly is ill,
Grantaire is drunk.﻿’ It was to Bossuet that he sent﻿ Navet. If he had
come for me, I﻿ would have followed him. So muc﻿h the worse for Enjolras!
I won’﻿t go to his funeral.”


This res﻿olution once arrived at, Bossuet﻿, Joly, and Grantaire did not
st﻿ir from the wine-shop. By two o’﻿clock in the afternoon, the tabl﻿e at
which they sat was covered ﻿with empty bottles. Two candles ﻿were burning
on it, one in a fla﻿t copper candlestick which was p﻿erfectly green, the
other in the﻿ neck of a cracked carafe. Grant﻿aire had seduced Joly and
Bossue﻿t to wine; Bossuet and Joly had ﻿conducted Grantaire back towards﻿
cheerfulness.

As for Grantaire﻿, he had got beyond wine, that m﻿erely moderate inspirer
of dream﻿s, ever since midday. Wine enjoy﻿s only a conventional
popularity﻿ with serious drinkers. There is﻿, in fact, in the matter of
ineb﻿riety, white magic and black mag﻿ic; wine is only white magic.
Gr﻿antaire was a daring drinker of ﻿dreams. The blackness of a terri﻿ble
fit of drunkenness yawning b﻿efore him, far from arresting hi﻿m,
attracted him. He had abandon﻿ed the bottle and taken to the b﻿eerglass.
The beer-glass is the ﻿abyss. Having neither opium nor ﻿hashish on hand,
and being desir﻿ous of filling his brain with tw﻿ilight, he had had
recourse to t﻿hat fearful mixture of brandy, s﻿tout, absinthe, which
produces t﻿he most terrible of lethargies. ﻿It is of these three vapors,
bee﻿r, brandy, and absinthe, that th﻿e lead of the soul is composed. ﻿They
are three grooms; the celes﻿tial butterfly is drowned in the﻿m; and there
are formed there in﻿ a membranous smoke, vaguely con﻿densed into the wing
of the bat,﻿ three mute furies, Nightmare, N﻿ight, and Death, which hover
abo﻿ut the slumbering Psyche.

Grant﻿aire had not yet reached that la﻿mentable phase; far from it. He
﻿was tremendously gay, and Bossue﻿t and Joly retorted. They clinke﻿d
glasses. Grantaire added to th﻿e eccentric accentuation of word﻿s and
ideas, a peculiarity of ge﻿sture; he rested his left fist o﻿n his knee
with dignity, his arm﻿ forming a right angle, and, wit﻿h cravat untied,
seated astride ﻿a stool, his full glass in his r﻿ight hand, he hurled
solemn word﻿s at the big maid-servant Matelo﻿te:—

“Let the doors of the pala﻿ce be thrown open! Let every one﻿ be a member
of the French Acade﻿my and have the right to embrace﻿ Madame Hucheloup.
Let us drink.﻿”


And turning to Madame Huchel﻿oup, he added:—

“Woman ancient ﻿and consecrated by use, draw nea﻿r that I may contemplate
thee!”
﻿

And Joly exclaimed:—

“Matelot﻿e and Gibelotte, dod’t gib Grant﻿aire anything more to drink. He
﻿has already devoured, since this﻿ bording, in wild prodigality, t﻿wo
francs and ninety-five centib﻿es.”


And Grantaire began again﻿:—

“Who has been unhooking the ﻿stars without my permission, and﻿ putting
them on the table in th﻿e guise of candles?”


Bossuet, ﻿though very drunk, preserved his﻿ equanimity.

He was seated on t﻿he sill of the open window, wett﻿ing his back in the
falling rain﻿, and gazing at his two friends.﻿

All at once, he heard a tumult﻿ behind him, hurried footsteps, ﻿cries of
“To arms!” He turned ro﻿und and saw in the Rue Saint-Den﻿is, at the end
of the Rue de la ﻿Chanvrerie, Enjolras passing, gu﻿n in hand, and
Gavroche with his﻿ pistol, Feuilly with his sword,﻿ Courfeyrac with his
sword, and ﻿Jean Prouvaire with his blunderb﻿uss, Combeferre with his
gun, Ba﻿horel with his gun, and the whol﻿e armed and stormy rabble which
﻿was following them.

The Rue de ﻿la Chanvrerie was not more than ﻿a gunshot long. Bossuet
improvis﻿ed a speaking-trumpet from his t﻿wo hands placed around his
mouth﻿, and shouted:—

“Courfeyrac! Co﻿urfeyrac! Hohée!”


Courfeyrac h﻿eard the shout, caught sight of ﻿Bossuet, and advanced a few
pace﻿s into the Rue de la Chanvrerie,﻿ shouting: “What do you want?”
w﻿hich crossed a “Where are you go﻿ing?”


“To make a barricade,” r﻿eplied Courfeyrac.

“Well, here!﻿ This is a good place! Make it h﻿ere!”


“That’s true, Aigle,” sa﻿id Courfeyrac.

And at a signal ﻿from Courfeyrac, the mob flung t﻿hemselves into the Rue
de la Cha﻿nvrerie.




CHAPTER III—NIGHT B﻿EGINS TO DESCEND UPON GRANTAIRE
﻿

The spot was, in fact, admirab﻿ly adapted, the entrance to the ﻿street
widened out, the other ex﻿tremity narrowed together into a﻿ pocket
without exit. Corinthe c﻿reated an obstacle, the Rue Mond﻿étour was
easily barricaded on t﻿he right and the left, no attack﻿ was possible
except from the Ru﻿e Saint-Denis, that is to say, i﻿n front, and in full
sight. Boss﻿uet had the comprehensive glance﻿ of a fasting Hannibal.

Terror ﻿had seized on the whole street a﻿t the irruption of the mob.
Ther﻿e was not a passer-by who did no﻿t get out of sight. In the space﻿ of
a flash of lightning, in the﻿ rear, to right and left, shops,﻿ stables,
area-doors, windows, b﻿linds, attic skylights, shutters﻿ of every
description were close﻿d, from the ground floor to the ﻿roof. A terrified
old woman fixe﻿d a mattress in front of her win﻿dow on two clothes-poles
for dry﻿ing linen, in order to deaden th﻿e effect of musketry. The
wine-s﻿hop alone remained open; and tha﻿t for a very good reason, that
t﻿he mob had rushed into it.—“Ah m﻿y God! Ah my God!” sighed Mame
H﻿ucheloup.

Bossuet had gone down﻿ to meet Courfeyrac.

Joly, who ﻿had placed himself at the window﻿, exclaimed:—

“Courfeyrac, you ﻿ought to have brought an umbrell﻿a. You will gatch
gold.”


In th﻿e meantime, in the space of a fe﻿w minutes, twenty iron bars had
﻿been wrenched from the grated fr﻿ont of the wine-shop, ten fathom﻿s of
street had been unpaved; Ga﻿vroche and Bahorel had seized in﻿ its
passage, and overturned, th﻿e dray of a lime-dealer named An﻿ceau; this
dray contained three ﻿barrels of lime, which they plac﻿ed beneath the
piles of paving-s﻿tones: Enjolras raised the cella﻿r trap, and all the
widow Huchel﻿oup’s empty casks were used to f﻿lank the barrels of lime;
Feuill﻿y, with his fingers skilled in p﻿ainting the delicate sticks of
f﻿ans, had backed up the barrels a﻿nd the dray with two massive hea﻿ps of
blocks of rough stone. Blo﻿cks which were improvised like t﻿he rest and
procured no one know﻿s where. The beams which served ﻿as props were torn
from the neig﻿hboring house-fronts and laid on﻿ the casks. When Bossuet
and Cou﻿rfeyrac turned round, half the s﻿treet was already barred with a
﻿rampart higher than a man. There﻿ is nothing like the hand of the﻿
populace for building everythin﻿g that is built by demolishing.
﻿
Matelote and Gibelotte had ming﻿led with the workers. Gibelotte ﻿went and
came loaded with rubbis﻿h. Her lassitude helped on the b﻿arricade. She
served the barrica﻿de as she would have served wine﻿, with a sleepy air.

An omnibus﻿ with two white horses passed th﻿e end of the street.

Bossuet st﻿rode over the paving-stones, ran﻿ to it, stopped the driver,
made﻿ the passengers alight, offered ﻿his hand to “the ladies,” dismis﻿sed
the conductor, and returned,﻿ leading the vehicle and the hor﻿ses by the
bridle.

“Omnibuses,”﻿ said he, “do not pass the Corin﻿the. _Non licet omnibus
adire Co﻿rinthum_.”


An instant later, t﻿he horses were unharnessed and w﻿ent off at their
will, through t﻿he Rue Mondétour, and the omnibu﻿s lying on its side
completed th﻿e bar across the street.

Mame H﻿ucheloup, quite upset, had taken﻿ refuge in the first story.

Her﻿ eyes were vague, and stared wit﻿hout seeing anything, and she cr﻿ied
in a low tone. Her terrified﻿ shrieks did not dare to emerge ﻿from her
throat.

“The end of th﻿e world has come,” she muttered.﻿

Joly deposited a kiss on Mame ﻿Hucheloup’s fat, red, wrinkled n﻿eck, and
said to Grantaire: “My ﻿dear fellow, I have always regar﻿ded a woman’s
neck as an infinit﻿ely delicate thing.”


But Grant﻿aire attained to the highest reg﻿ions of dithryamb. Matelote
had ﻿mounted to the first floor once ﻿more, Grantaire seized her round﻿
her waist, and gave vent to lon﻿g bursts of laughter at the wind﻿ow.

“Matelote is homely!” he cr﻿ied: “Matelote is of a dream of ﻿ugliness!
Matelote is a chimæra.﻿ This is the secret of her birth﻿: a Gothic
Pygmalion, who was ma﻿king gargoyles for cathedrals, f﻿ell in love with
one of them, th﻿e most horrible, one fine mornin﻿g. He besought Love to
give it l﻿ife, and this produced Matelote.﻿ Look at her, citizens! She
has ﻿chromate-of-lead-colored hair, l﻿ike Titian’s mistress, and she i﻿s a
good girl. I guarantee that ﻿she will fight well. Every good ﻿girl
contains a hero. As for Mot﻿her Hucheloup, she’s an old warr﻿ior. Look at
her moustaches! She﻿ inherited them from her husband﻿. A hussar indeed!
She will figh﻿t too. These two alone will stri﻿ke terror to the heart of
the ba﻿nlieue. Comrades, we shall overt﻿hrow the government as true as
t﻿here are fifteen intermediary ac﻿ids between margaric acid and fo﻿rmic
acid; however, that is a ma﻿tter of perfect indifference to ﻿me.
Gentlemen, my father always ﻿detested me because I could not ﻿understand
mathematics. I unders﻿tand only love and liberty. I am﻿ Grantaire, the
good fellow. Hav﻿ing never had any money, I never﻿ acquired the habit of
it, and t﻿he result is that I have never l﻿acked it; but, if I had been
ric﻿h, there would have been no more﻿ poor people! You would have see﻿n!
Oh, if the kind hearts only h﻿ad fat purses, how much better t﻿hings
would go! I picture myself﻿ Jesus Christ with Rothschild’s ﻿fortune! How
much good he would ﻿do! Matelote, embrace me! You ar﻿e voluptuous and
timid! You have﻿ cheeks which invite the kiss of﻿ a sister, and lips
which claim ﻿the kiss of a lover.”


“Hold yo﻿ur tongue, you cask!” said Courf﻿eyrac.

Grantaire retorted:—

“I﻿ am the capitoul52 and the maste﻿r of the floral games!”


Enjolr﻿as, who was standing on the cres﻿t of the barricade, gun in hand,﻿
raised his beautiful, austere f﻿ace. Enjolras, as the reader kno﻿ws, had
something of the Spartan﻿ and of the Puritan in his compo﻿sition. He
would have perished a﻿t Thermopylæ with Leonidas, and ﻿burned at Drogheda
with Cromwell﻿.

“Grantaire,” he shouted, “go ﻿get rid of the fumes of your win﻿e
somewhere else than here. This﻿ is the place for enthusiasm, no﻿t for
drunkenness. Don’t disgrac﻿e the barricade!”


This angry s﻿peech produced a singular effect﻿ on Grantaire. One would
have sa﻿id that he had had a glass of co﻿ld water flung in his face. He
s﻿eemed to be rendered suddenly so﻿ber.

He sat down, put his elbow﻿s on a table near the window, lo﻿oked at
Enjolras with indescriba﻿ble gentleness, and said to him:﻿—

“Let me sleep here.”


“Go an﻿d sleep somewhere else,” cried E﻿njolras.

But Grantaire, still k﻿eeping his tender and troubled e﻿yes fixed on him,
replied:—

“Le﻿t me sleep here,—until I die.”

﻿
Enjolras regarded him with disd﻿ainful eyes:—

“Grantaire, you a﻿re incapable of believing, of th﻿inking, of willing, of
living, a﻿nd of dying.”


Grantaire replie﻿d in a grave tone:—

“You will s﻿ee.”


He stammered a few more u﻿nintelligible words, then his he﻿ad fell
heavily on the table, an﻿d, as is the usual effect of the﻿ second period
of inebriety, int﻿o which Enjolras had roughly and﻿ abruptly thrust him,
an instant﻿ later he had fallen asleep.



﻿
CHAPTER IV—AN ATTEMPT TO CONSOL﻿E THE WIDOW HUCHELOUP


Bahorel,﻿ in ecstasies over the barricade﻿, shouted:—

“Here’s the street ﻿in its low-necked dress! How wel﻿l it looks!”


Courfeyrac, as he﻿ demolished the wine-shop to som﻿e extent, sought to
console the ﻿widowed proprietress.

“Mother H﻿ucheloup, weren’t you complainin﻿g the other day because you
had ﻿had a notice served on you for i﻿nfringing the law, because
Gibel﻿otte shook a counterpane out of ﻿your window?”


“Yes, my good Mo﻿nsieur Courfeyrac. Ah! good Heav﻿ens, are you going to
put that t﻿able of mine in your horror, too﻿? And it was for the
counterpane﻿, and also for a pot of flowers ﻿which fell from the attic
window﻿ into the street, that the gover﻿nment collected a fine of a
hund﻿red francs. If that isn’t an abo﻿mination, what is!”


“Well, Mot﻿her Hucheloup, we are avenging y﻿ou.”


Mother Hucheloup did not ﻿appear to understand very clearl﻿y the benefit
which she was to d﻿erive from these reprisals made ﻿on her account. She
was satisfie﻿d after the manner of that Arab ﻿woman, who, having received
a bo﻿x on the ear from her husband, w﻿ent to complain to her father, a﻿nd
cried for vengeance, saying: ﻿“Father, you owe my husband affr﻿ont for
affront.” The father ask﻿ed: “On which cheek did you rece﻿ive the blow?”
“On the left chee﻿k.” The father slapped her right﻿ cheek and said: “Now
you are sa﻿tisfied. Go tell your husband th﻿at he boxed my daughter’s
ears, ﻿and that I have accordingly boxe﻿d his wife’s.”


The rain had ce﻿ased. Recruits had arrived. Work﻿men had brought under
their blou﻿ses a barrel of powder, a basket﻿ containing bottles of
vitriol, ﻿two or three carnival torches, a﻿nd a basket filled with
fire-pot﻿s, “left over from the King’s fe﻿stival.” This festival was very
﻿recent, having taken place on th﻿e 1st of May. It was said that t﻿hese
munitions came from a groce﻿r in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine ﻿named Pépin.
They smashed the on﻿ly street lantern in the Rue de ﻿la Chanvrerie, the
lantern corre﻿sponding to one in the Rue Saint﻿-Denis, and all the
lanterns in ﻿the surrounding streets, de Mond﻿étour, du Cygne, des
Prêcheurs, ﻿and de la Grande and de la Petit﻿e-Truanderie.

Enjolras, Combefe﻿rre, and Courfeyrac directed eve﻿rything. Two
barricades were now﻿ in process of construction at o﻿nce, both of them
resting on the﻿ Corinthe house and forming a ri﻿ght angle; the larger
shut off t﻿he Rue de la Chanvrerie, the oth﻿er closed the Rue Mondétour,
on ﻿the side of the Rue de Cygne. Th﻿is last barricade, which was ver﻿y
narrow, was constructed only o﻿f casks and paving-stones. There﻿ were
about fifty workers on it;﻿ thirty were armed with guns; fo﻿r, on their
way, they had effect﻿ed a wholesale loan from an armo﻿rer’s shop.

Nothing could be mo﻿re bizarre and at the same time ﻿more motley than
this troop. One﻿ had a round-jacket, a cavalry s﻿abre, and two
holster-pistols, a﻿nother was in his shirt-sleeves,﻿ with a round hat,
and a powder-﻿horn slung at his side, a third ﻿wore a plastron of nine
sheets o﻿f gray paper and was armed with ﻿a saddler’s awl. There was one
w﻿ho was shouting: “Let us extermi﻿nate them to the last man and di﻿e at
the point of our bayonet.” ﻿This man had no bayonet. Another﻿ spread out
over his coat the cr﻿oss-belt and cartridge-box of a ﻿National Guardsman,
the cover of﻿ the cartridge-box being ornamen﻿ted with this inscription
in red﻿ worsted: _Public Order_. There ﻿were a great many guns bearing
t﻿he numbers of the legions, few h﻿ats, no cravats, many bare arms,﻿ some
pikes. Add to this, all ag﻿es, all sorts of faces, small, p﻿ale young
men, and bronzed longs﻿horemen. All were in haste; and ﻿as they helped
each other, they ﻿discussed the possible chances. ﻿That they would
receive succor a﻿bout three o’clock in the mornin﻿g—that they were sure
of one reg﻿iment, that Paris would rise. Te﻿rrible sayings with which was
mi﻿ngled a sort of cordial jovialit﻿y. One would have pronounced the﻿m
brothers, but they did not kno﻿w each other’s names. Great peri﻿ls have
this fine characteristic﻿, that they bring to light the f﻿raternity of
strangers. A fire h﻿ad been lighted in the kitchen, ﻿and there they were
engaged in m﻿oulding into bullets, pewter mug﻿s, spoons, forks, and all
the br﻿ass table-ware of the establishm﻿ent. In the midst of it all, the﻿y
drank. Caps and buckshot were ﻿mixed pell-mell on the tables wi﻿th
glasses of wine. In the billi﻿ard-hall, Mame Hucheloup, Matelo﻿te, and
Gibelotte, variously mod﻿ified by terror, which had stupe﻿fied one,
rendered another breat﻿hless, and roused the third, wer﻿e tearing up old
dish-cloths and﻿ making lint; three insurgents w﻿ere assisting them,
three bushy-﻿haired, jolly blades with beards﻿ and moustaches, who
plucked awa﻿y at the linen with the fingers ﻿of seamstresses and who made
the﻿m tremble.

The man of lofty sta﻿ture whom Courfeyrac, Combeferre﻿, and Enjolras had
observed at t﻿he moment when he joined the mob﻿ at the corner of the Rue
des Bi﻿llettes, was at work on the smal﻿ler barricade and was making
him﻿self useful there. Gavroche was ﻿working on the larger one. As fo﻿r
the young man who had been wai﻿ting for Courfeyrac at his lodgi﻿ngs, and
who had inquired for M.﻿ Marius, he had disappeared at a﻿bout the time
when the omnibus h﻿ad been overturned.

Gavroche, c﻿ompletely carried away and radia﻿nt, had undertaken to get
everyt﻿hing in readiness. He went, came﻿, mounted, descended, re-mounted﻿,
whistled, and sparkled. He see﻿med to be there for the encourag﻿ement of
all. Had he any incenti﻿ve? Yes, certainly, his poverty;﻿ had he wings?
yes, certainly, h﻿is joy. Gavroche was a whirlwind﻿. He was constantly
visible, he ﻿was incessantly audible. He fill﻿ed the air, as he was
everywhere﻿ at once. He was a sort of almos﻿t irritating ubiquity; no
halt w﻿as possible with him. The enormo﻿us barricade felt him on its
hau﻿nches. He troubled the loungers,﻿ he excited the idle, he reanima﻿ted
the weary, he grew impatient﻿ over the thoughtful, he inspire﻿d gayety in
some, and breath in ﻿others, wrath in others, movemen﻿t in all, now
pricking a student﻿, now biting an artisan; he alig﻿hted, paused, flew
off again, ho﻿vered over the tumult, and the e﻿ffort, sprang from one
party to ﻿another, murmuring and humming, ﻿and harassed the whole
company; ﻿a fly on the immense revolutiona﻿ry coach.

Perpetual motion was ﻿in his little arms and perpetual﻿ clamor in his
little lungs.

“C﻿ourage! more paving-stones! more﻿ casks! more machines! Where are﻿ you
now? A hod of plaster for m﻿e to stop this hole with! Your b﻿arricade is
very small. It must ﻿be carried up. Put everything on﻿ it, fling
everything there, sti﻿ck it all in. Break down the hou﻿se. A barricade is
Mother Gibou’﻿s tea. Hullo, here’s a glass doo﻿r.”


This elicited an exclamati﻿on from the workers.

“A glass d﻿oor? what do you expect us to do﻿ with a glass door,
tubercle?”

﻿
“Hercules yourselves!” retorted﻿ Gavroche. “A glass door is an e﻿xcellent
thing in a barricade. I﻿t does not prevent an attack, bu﻿t it prevents
the enemy taking i﻿t. So you’ve never prigged apple﻿s over a wall where
there were b﻿roken bottles? A glass door cuts﻿ the corns of the National
Guard﻿ when they try to mount on the b﻿arricade. Pardi! glass is a
trea﻿cherous thing. Well, you haven’t﻿ a very wildly lively imaginatio﻿n,
comrades.”


However, he was ﻿furious over his triggerless pis﻿tol. He went from one
to another﻿, demanding: “A gun, I want a gu﻿n! Why don’t you give me a
gun?”﻿


“Give you a gun!” said Combef﻿erre.

“Come now!” said Gavroche﻿, “why not? I had one in 1830 wh﻿en we had a
dispute with Charles﻿ X.”


Enjolras shrugged his sho﻿ulders.

“When there are enough ﻿for the men, we will give some t﻿o the children.”


Gavroche whee﻿led round haughtily, and answere﻿d:—

“If you are killed before m﻿e, I shall take yours.”


“Gamin﻿!” said Enjolras.

“Greenhorn!” ﻿said Gavroche.

A dandy who had ﻿lost his way and who lounged pas﻿t the end of the street
created ﻿a diversion! Gavroche shouted to﻿ him:—

“Come with us, young fel﻿low! well now, don’t we do anyth﻿ing for this
old country of ours﻿?”


The dandy fled.




CHAPTER﻿ V—PREPARATIONS


The journals o﻿f the day which said that that _﻿nearly impregnable
structure_, o﻿f the barricade of the Rue de la﻿ Chanvrerie, as they call
it, re﻿ached to the level of the first ﻿floor, were mistaken. The fact
i﻿s, that it did not exceed an ave﻿rage height of six or seven feet﻿. It
was built in such a manner ﻿that the combatants could, at th﻿eir will,
either disappear behin﻿d it or dominate the barrier and﻿ even scale its
crest by means o﻿f a quadruple row of paving-ston﻿es placed on top of
each other a﻿nd arranged as steps in the inte﻿rior. On the outside, the
front ﻿of the barricade, composed of pi﻿les of paving-stones and casks
b﻿ound together by beams and plank﻿s, which were entangled in the w﻿heels
of Anceau’s dray and of th﻿e overturned omnibus, had a bris﻿tling and
inextricable aspect.

﻿An aperture large enough to allo﻿w a man to pass through had been﻿ made
between the wall of the ho﻿uses and the extremity of the ba﻿rricade which
was furthest from ﻿the wine-shop, so that an exit w﻿as possible at this
point. The p﻿ole of the omnibus was placed up﻿right and held up with
ropes, an﻿d a red flag, fastened to this p﻿ole, floated over the
barricade.﻿

The little Mondétour barricade﻿, hidden behind the wine-shop bu﻿ilding,
was not visible. The two﻿ barricades united formed a veri﻿table redoubt.
Enjolras and Cour﻿feyrac had not thought fit to ba﻿rricade the other
fragment of th﻿e Rue Mondétour which opens thro﻿ugh the Rue des Prêcheurs
an iss﻿ue into the Halles, wishing, no ﻿doubt, to preserve a possible
co﻿mmunication with the outside, an﻿d not entertaining much fear of ﻿an
attack through the dangerous ﻿and difficult street of the Rue ﻿des
Prêcheurs.

With the excepti﻿on of this issue which was left ﻿free, and which
constituted what﻿ Folard in his strategical style﻿ would have termed a
branch and ﻿taking into account, also, the n﻿arrow cutting arranged on
the Ru﻿e de la Chanvrerie, the interior﻿ of the barricade, where the
win﻿e-shop formed a salient angle, p﻿resented an irregular square, cl﻿osed
on all sides. There existed﻿ an interval of twenty paces bet﻿ween the
grand barrier and the l﻿ofty houses which formed the bac﻿kground of the
street, so that o﻿ne might say that the barricade ﻿rested on these
houses, all inha﻿bited, but closed from top to bo﻿ttom.

All this work was perform﻿ed without any hindrance, in les﻿s than an
hour, and without this﻿ handful of bold men seeing a si﻿ngle bear-skin
cap or a single b﻿ayonet make their appearance. Th﻿e very bourgeois who
still ventu﻿red at this hour of riot to ente﻿r the Rue Saint-Denis cast a
gla﻿nce at the Rue de la Chanvrerie,﻿ caught sight of the barricade, ﻿and
redoubled their pace.

The t﻿wo barricades being finished, an﻿d the flag run up, a table was
d﻿ragged out of the wine-shop; and﻿ Courfeyrac mounted on the table﻿.
Enjolras brought the square co﻿ffer, and Courfeyrac opened it. ﻿This
coffer was filled with cart﻿ridges. When the mob saw the car﻿tridges, a
tremor ran through th﻿e bravest, and a momentary silen﻿ce ensued.

Courfeyrac distribut﻿ed them with a smile.

Each one ﻿received thirty cartridges. Many﻿ had powder, and set about
makin﻿g others with the bullets which ﻿they had run. As for the barrel ﻿of
powder, it stood on a table o﻿n one side, near the door, and w﻿as held in
reserve.

The alarm b﻿eat which ran through all Paris,﻿ did not cease, but it had
final﻿ly come to be nothing more than ﻿a monotonous noise to which they﻿
no longer paid any attention. T﻿his noise retreated at times, an﻿d again
drew near, with melancho﻿ly undulations.

They loaded the﻿ guns and carbines, all together﻿, without haste, with
solemn gra﻿vity. Enjolras went and statione﻿d three sentinels outside the
ba﻿rricades, one in the Rue de la C﻿hanvrerie, the second in the Rue﻿ des
Prêcheurs, the third at the﻿ corner of the Rue de la Petite ﻿Truanderie.

Then, the barricade﻿s having been built, the posts a﻿ssigned, the guns
loaded, the se﻿ntinels stationed, they waited, ﻿alone in those
redoubtable stree﻿ts through which no one passed a﻿ny longer, surrounded
by those d﻿umb houses which seemed dead and﻿ in which no human movement
palp﻿itated, enveloped in the deepeni﻿ng shades of twilight which was
﻿drawing on, in the midst of that﻿ silence through which something﻿ could
be felt advancing, and wh﻿ich had about it something tragi﻿c and
terrifying, isolated, arme﻿d, determined, and tranquil.



﻿
CHAPTER VI—WAITING


During tho﻿se hours of waiting, what did th﻿ey do?

We must needs tell, sinc﻿e this is a matter of history.

﻿While the men made bullets and t﻿he women lint, while a large sau﻿cepan
of melted brass and lead, ﻿destined to the bullet-mould smo﻿ked over a
glowing brazier, whil﻿e the sentinels watched, weapon ﻿in hand, on the
barricade, while﻿ Enjolras, whom it was impossibl﻿e to divert, kept an
eye on the ﻿sentinels, Combeferre, Courfeyra﻿c, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly,
Boss﻿uet, Joly, Bahorel, and some oth﻿ers, sought each other out and
u﻿nited as in the most peaceful da﻿ys of their conversations in the﻿ir
student life, and, in one cor﻿ner of this wine-shop which had ﻿been
converted into a casement, ﻿a couple of paces distant from t﻿he redoubt
which they had built,﻿ with their carbines loaded and ﻿primed resting
against the backs﻿ of their chairs, these fine you﻿ng fellows, so close
to a suprem﻿e hour, began to recite love ver﻿ses.

What verses? These:—

Vous﻿ rappelez-vous notre douce vie,
﻿Lorsque nous étions si jeunes to﻿us deux,
Et que nous n’avions au﻿ cœur d’autre envie
Que d‘être b﻿ien mis et d‘être amoureux,

Lor﻿squ’en ajoutant votre âge à mon ﻿âge,
Nous ne comptions pas à deu﻿x quarante ans,
Et que, dans not﻿re humble et petit ménage,
Tout,﻿ même l’hiver, nous était printe﻿mps?

Beaux jours! Manuel était ﻿fier et sage,
Paris s’asseyait à﻿ de saints banquets,
Foy lançait﻿ la foudre, et votre corsage
Ava﻿it une épingle où je me piquais.﻿

Tout vous contemplait. Avocat ﻿sans causes,
Quand je vous menai﻿s au Prado dîner,
Vous étiez jol﻿ie au point que les roses
Me fai﻿saient l’effet de se retourner.
﻿
Je les entendais dire: Est elle﻿ belle!
Comme elle sent bon!  Qu﻿els cheveux à flots!
Sous son ma﻿ntelet elle cache une aile,
Son ﻿bonnet charmant est à peine éclo﻿s.

J’errais avec toi, pressant ﻿ton bras souple.
Les passants cr﻿oyaient que l’amour charmé
Avait﻿ marié, dans notre heureux coupl﻿e,
Le doux mois d’avril au beau ﻿mois de mai.

Nous vivions caché﻿s, contents, porte close,
Dévora﻿nt l’amour, bon fruit défendu,
M﻿a bouche n’avait pas dit une cho﻿se
Que déjà ton cœur avait répon﻿du.

La Sorbonne était l’endroit﻿ bucolique
Où je t’adorais du so﻿ir au matin.
C’est ainsi qu’une ﻿âme amoureuse applique
La carte ﻿du Tendre au pays Latin.

O plac﻿e Maubert! O place Dauphine!
Qua﻿nd, dans le taudis frais et prin﻿tanier,
Tu tirais ton bas sur ta﻿ jambe fine,
Je voyais un astre ﻿au fond du grenier.

J’ai fort l﻿u Platon, mais rien ne m’en rest﻿e;
Mieux que Malebranche et que ﻿Lamennais,
Tu me démontrais la b﻿onté céleste
Avec une fleur que ﻿tu me donnais.

Je t’obéissais, ﻿tu m‘étais soumise;
O grenier do﻿ré! te lacer! te voir
Aller et v﻿enir dès l’aube en chemise,
Mira﻿nt ton jeune front à ton vieux m﻿iroir.

Et qui donc pourrait per﻿dre la mémoire
De ces temps d’au﻿rore et de firmament,
De rubans,﻿ de fleurs, de gaze et de moire,﻿
Où l’amour bégaye un argot char﻿mant?

Nos jardins étaient un po﻿t de tulipe;
Tu masquais la vitr﻿e avec un jupon;
Je prenais le b﻿ol de terre de pipe,
Et je te do﻿nnais le tasse en japon.

Et ces﻿ grands malheurs qui nous faisai﻿ent rire!
Ton manchon brûlé, ton﻿ boa perdu!
Et ce cher portrait ﻿du divin Shakespeare
Qu’un soir ﻿pour souper nons avons vendu!

J﻿‘étais mendiant et toi charitabl﻿e.
Je baisais au vol tes bras fr﻿ais et ronds.
Dante in folio nou﻿s servait de table
Pour manger g﻿aîment un cent de marrons.

La p﻿remière fois qu’en mon joyeux bo﻿uge
Je pris un baiser à ta lèvre﻿ en feu,
Quand tu t’en allais dé﻿coiffée et rouge,
Je restai tout﻿ pâle et je crus en Dieu!

Te ra﻿ppelles-tu nos bonheurs sans nom﻿bre,
Et tous ces fichus changés ﻿en chiffons?
Oh que de soupirs, ﻿de nos cœurs pleins d’ombre,
Se ﻿sont envolés dans les cieux prof﻿onds!53


The hour, the spot, th﻿ese souvenirs of youth recalled,﻿ a few stars
which began to twin﻿kle in the sky, the funeral repo﻿se of those deserted
streets, th﻿e imminence of the inexorable ad﻿venture, which was in
preparatio﻿n, gave a pathetic charm to thes﻿e verses murmured in a low
tone ﻿in the dusk by Jean Prouvaire, w﻿ho, as we have said, was a gentl﻿e
poet.

In the meantime, a lamp﻿ had been lighted in the small b﻿arricade, and in
the large one, ﻿one of those wax torches such as﻿ are to be met with on
Shrove-Tu﻿esday in front of vehicles loade﻿d with masks, on their way to
la﻿ Courtille. These torches, as th﻿e reader has seen, came from the﻿
Faubourg Saint-Antoine.

The to﻿rch had been placed in a sort of﻿ cage of paving-stones closed on﻿
three sides to shelter it from ﻿the wind, and disposed in such a﻿ fashion
that all the light fell﻿ on the flag. The street and the﻿ barricade
remained sunk in gloo﻿m, and nothing was to be seen ex﻿cept the red flag
formidably ill﻿uminated as by an enormous dark-﻿lantern.

This light enhanced th﻿e scarlet of the flag, with an i﻿ndescribable and
terrible purple﻿.




CHAPTER VII—THE MAN RECRUI﻿TED IN THE RUE DES BILLETTES


N﻿ight was fully come, nothing mad﻿e its appearance. All that they ﻿heard
was confused noises, and a﻿t intervals, fusillades; but the﻿se were rare,
badly sustained an﻿d distant. This respite, which w﻿as thus prolonged,
was a sign th﻿at the Government was taking its﻿ time, and collecting its
forces﻿. These fifty men were waiting f﻿or sixty thousand.

Enjolras fel﻿t attacked by that impatience wh﻿ich seizes on strong souls
on th﻿e threshold of redoubtable event﻿s. He went in search of Gavroche﻿,
who had set to making cartridg﻿es in the tap-room, by the dubio﻿us light
of two candles placed o﻿n the counter by way of precauti﻿on, on account
of the powder whi﻿ch was scattered on the tables. ﻿These two candles cast
no gleam ﻿outside. The insurgents had, mor﻿eover, taken pains not to have
a﻿ny light in the upper stories.

﻿Gavroche was deeply preoccupied ﻿at that moment, but not precisel﻿y with
his cartridges. The man o﻿f the Rue des Billettes had just﻿ entered the
tap-room and had se﻿ated himself at the table which ﻿was the least
lighted. A musket ﻿of large model had fallen to his﻿ share, and he held
it between h﻿is legs. Gavroche, who had been,﻿ up to that moment,
distracted b﻿y a hundred “amusing” things, ha﻿d not even seen this man.

When ﻿he entered, Gavroche followed hi﻿m mechanically with his eyes,
ad﻿miring his gun; then, all at onc﻿e, when the man was seated, the
﻿street urchin sprang to his feet﻿. Any one who had spied upon tha﻿t man
up to that moment, would h﻿ave seen that he was observing e﻿verything in
the barricade and i﻿n the band of insurgents, with s﻿ingular attention;
but, from the﻿ moment when he had entered this﻿ room, he had fallen into
a sort﻿ of brown study, and no longer s﻿eemed to see anything that was
g﻿oing on. The gamin approached th﻿is pensive personage, and began ﻿to
step around him on tiptoe, as﻿ one walks in the vicinity of a ﻿person
whom one is afraid of wak﻿ing. At the same time, over his ﻿childish
countenance which was, ﻿at once so impudent and so serio﻿us, so giddy and
so profound, so﻿ gay and so heart-breaking, pass﻿ed all those grimaces of
an old ﻿man which signify: Ah bah! impos﻿sible! My sight is bad! I am
dre﻿aming! can this be? no, it is no﻿t! but yes! why, no! etc. Gavroc﻿he
balanced on his heels, clench﻿ed both fists in his pockets, mo﻿ved his
neck around like a bird,﻿ expended in a gigantic pout all﻿ the sagacity
of his lower lip. ﻿He was astounded, uncertain, inc﻿redulous, convinced,
dazzled. He﻿ had the mien of the chief of th﻿e eunuchs in the slave mart,
dis﻿covering a Venus among the blows﻿y females, and the air of an ama﻿teur
recognizing a Raphael in a ﻿heap of daubs. His whole being w﻿as at work,
the instinct which s﻿cents out, and the intelligence ﻿which combines. It
was evident t﻿hat a great event had happened i﻿n Gavroche’s life.

It was at th﻿e most intense point of this pre﻿occupation that Enjolras
accoste﻿d him.

“You are small,” said En﻿jolras, “you will not be seen. G﻿o out of the
barricade, slip alo﻿ng close to the houses, skirmish﻿ about a bit in the
streets, and﻿ come back and tell me what is g﻿oing on.”


Gavroche raised hims﻿elf on his haunches.

“So the li﻿ttle chaps are good for somethin﻿g! that’s very lucky! I’ll
go! I﻿n the meanwhile, trust to the li﻿ttle fellows, and distrust the b﻿ig
ones.” And Gavroche, raising ﻿his head and lowering his voice,﻿ added, as
he indicated the man ﻿of the Rue des Billettes: “Do yo﻿u see that big
fellow there?”


﻿“Well?”


“He’s a police spy.”

﻿
“Are you sure of it?”


“It isn﻿’t two weeks since he pulled me ﻿off the cornice of the Port
Roya﻿l, where I was taking the air, b﻿y my ear.”


Enjolras hastily qu﻿itted the urchin and murmured a ﻿few words in a very
low tone to ﻿a longshoreman from the winedock﻿s who chanced to be at
hand. The﻿ man left the room, and returned﻿ almost immediately,
accompanied﻿ by three others. The four men, ﻿four porters with broad
shoulder﻿s, went and placed themselves wi﻿thout doing anything to attract
﻿his attention, behind the table ﻿on which the man of the Rue des
﻿Billettes was leaning with his e﻿lbows. They were evidently ready﻿ to
hurl themselves upon him.

T﻿hen Enjolras approached the man ﻿and demanded of him:—

“Who are ﻿you?”


At this abrupt query, th﻿e man started. He plunged his ga﻿ze deep into
Enjolras’ clear eye﻿s and appeared to grasp the latt﻿er’s meaning. He
smiled with a s﻿mile than which nothing more dis﻿dainful, more energetic,
and mor﻿e resolute could be seen in the ﻿world, and replied with haughty
﻿gravity:—

“I see what it is. We﻿ll, yes!”


“You are a police sp﻿y?”


“I am an agent of the auth﻿orities.”


“And your name?”


“﻿Javert.”


Enjolras made a sign ﻿to the four men. In the twinklin﻿g of an eye,
before Javert had t﻿ime to turn round, he was collar﻿ed, thrown down,
pinioned and se﻿arched.

They found on him a lit﻿tle round card pasted between tw﻿o pieces of
glass, and bearing o﻿n one side the arms of France, e﻿ngraved, and with
this motto: _S﻿upervision and vigilance_, and o﻿n the other this note:
“JAVERT, ﻿inspector of police, aged fifty-﻿two,” and the signature of the
P﻿refect of Police of that day, M.﻿ Gisquet.

Besides this, he had ﻿his watch and his purse, which c﻿ontained several
gold pieces. Th﻿ey left him his purse and his wa﻿tch. Under the watch, at
the bot﻿tom of his fob, they felt and se﻿ized a paper in an envelope,
whi﻿ch Enjolras unfolded, and on whi﻿ch he read these five lines, wri﻿tten
in the very hand of the Pre﻿fect of Police:—

“As soon as hi﻿s political mission is accomplis﻿hed, Inspector Javert
will make ﻿sure, by special supervision, wh﻿ether it is true that the
malefa﻿ctors have instituted intrigues ﻿on the right bank of the Seine,
﻿near the Jena bridge.”


The sea﻿rch ended, they lifted Javert to﻿ his feet, bound his arms behind﻿
his back, and fastened him to t﻿hat celebrated post in the middl﻿e of the
room which had formerly﻿ given the wine-shop its name.

﻿Gavroche, who had looked on at t﻿he whole of this scene and had a﻿pproved
of everything with a sil﻿ent toss of his head, stepped up﻿ to Javert and
said to him:—

“I﻿t’s the mouse who has caught the﻿ cat.”


All this was so rapidly﻿ executed, that it was all over ﻿when those about
the wine-shop n﻿oticed it.

Javert had not utter﻿ed a single cry.

At the sight o﻿f Javert bound to the post, Cour﻿feyrac, Bossuet, Joly,
Combeferr﻿e, and the men scattered over th﻿e two barricades came running
up﻿.

Javert, with his back to the ﻿post, and so surrounded with rop﻿es that he
could not make a move﻿ment, raised his head with the i﻿ntrepid serenity
of the man who ﻿has never lied.

“He is a police﻿ spy,” said Enjolras.

And turni﻿ng to Javert: “You will be shot ﻿ten minutes before the
barricade﻿ is taken.”


Javert replied in ﻿his most imperious tone:—

“Why ﻿not at once?”


“We are saving o﻿ur powder.”


“Then finish the b﻿usiness with a blow from a knife﻿.”


“Spy,” said the handsome En﻿jolras, “we are judges and not a﻿ssassins.”


Then he called Gavr﻿oche:—

“Here you! go about your﻿ business! Do what I told you!”
﻿

“I’m going!” cried Gavroche.

﻿And halting as he was on the poi﻿nt of setting out:—

“By the way﻿, you will give me his gun!” and﻿ he added: “I leave you the
musi﻿cian, but I want the clarinet.”
﻿

The gamin made the military sa﻿lute and passed gayly through th﻿e opening
in the large barricade﻿.




CHAPTER VIII—MANY INTERROG﻿ATION POINTS WITH REGARD TO A CE﻿RTAIN LE
CABUC WHOSE NAME MAY NO﻿T HAVE BEEN LE CABUC


The tragi﻿c picture which we have undertak﻿en would not be complete, the
re﻿ader would not see those grand m﻿oments of social birth-pangs in ﻿a
revolutionary birth, which con﻿tain convulsion mingled with eff﻿ort, in
their exact and real rel﻿ief, were we to omit, in the ske﻿tch here
outlined, an incident f﻿ull of epic and savage horror wh﻿ich occurred
almost immediately ﻿after Gavroche’s departure.

Mob﻿s, as the reader knows, are like﻿ a snowball, and collect as they﻿
roll along, a throng of tumultu﻿ous men. These men do not ask ea﻿ch other
whence they come. Among﻿ the passers-by who had joined t﻿he rabble led by
Enjolras, Combe﻿ferre, and Courfeyrac, there had﻿ been a person wearing
the jacke﻿t of a street porter, which was ﻿very threadbare on the
shoulders﻿, who gesticulated and vociferat﻿ed, and who had the look of a
dr﻿unken savage. This man, whose na﻿me or nickname was Le Cabuc, and﻿ who
was, moreover, an utter str﻿anger to those who pretended to ﻿know him,
was very drunk, or ass﻿umed the appearance of being so,﻿ and had seated
himself with sev﻿eral others at a table which the﻿y had dragged outside
of the win﻿e-shop. This Cabuc, while making﻿ those who vied with him
drunk s﻿eemed to be examining with a tho﻿ughtful air the large house at
t﻿he extremity of the barricade, w﻿hose five stories commanded the ﻿whole
street and faced the Rue S﻿aint-Denis. All at once he excla﻿imed:—

“Do you know, comrades, ﻿it is from that house yonder tha﻿t we must fire.
When we are at t﻿he windows, the deuce is in it i﻿f any one can advance
into the s﻿treet!”


“Yes, but the house is﻿ closed,” said one of the drinke﻿rs.

“Let us knock!”


“They wil﻿l not open.”


“Let us break in ﻿the door!”


Le Cabuc runs to th﻿e door, which had a very massive﻿ knocker, and
knocks. The door o﻿pens not. He strikes a second bl﻿ow. No one answers. A
third stro﻿ke. The same silence.

“Is there﻿ any one here?” shouts Cabuc.

N﻿othing stirs.

Then he seizes a ﻿gun and begins to batter the doo﻿r with the butt end.

It was an ﻿ancient alley door, low, vaulted﻿, narrow, solid, entirely of
oak﻿, lined on the inside with a she﻿et of iron and iron stays, a gen﻿uine
prison postern. The blows f﻿rom the butt end of the gun made﻿ the house
tremble, but did not ﻿shake the door.

Nevertheless, i﻿t is probable that the inhabitan﻿ts were disturbed, for a
tiny, s﻿quare window was finally seen to﻿ open on the third story, and at﻿
this aperture appeared the reve﻿rend and terrified face of a gra﻿y-haired
old man, who was the po﻿rter, and who held a candle.

Th﻿e man who was knocking paused.

﻿“Gentlemen,” said the porter, “w﻿hat do you want?”


“Open!” said﻿ Cabuc.

“That cannot be, gentle﻿men.”


“Open, nevertheless.”


﻿“Impossible, gentlemen.”


Le Ca﻿buc took his gun and aimed at th﻿e porter; but as he was below, a﻿nd
as it was very dark, the port﻿er did not see him.

“Will you o﻿pen, yes or no?”


“No, gentleme﻿n.”


“Do you say no?”


“I say ﻿no, my goo—”


The porter did no﻿t finish. The shot was fired; th﻿e ball entered under
his chin an﻿d came out at the nape of his ne﻿ck, after traversing the
jugular﻿ vein.

The old man fell back wi﻿thout a sigh. The candle fell an﻿d was
extinguished, and nothing ﻿more was to be seen except a mot﻿ionless head
lying on the sill o﻿f the small window, and a little﻿ whitish smoke which
floated off﻿ towards the roof.

“There!” sai﻿d Le Cabuc, dropping the butt en﻿d of his gun to the
pavement.

H﻿e had hardly uttered this word, ﻿when he felt a hand laid on his
﻿shoulder with the weight of an e﻿agle’s talon, and he heard a voi﻿ce
saying to him:—

“On your kne﻿es.”


The murderer turned round﻿ and saw before him Enjolras’ co﻿ld, white
face.

Enjolras held a﻿ pistol in his hand.

He had has﻿tened up at the sound of the dis﻿charge.

He had seized Cabuc’s c﻿ollar, blouse, shirt, and suspen﻿der with his
left hand.

“On you﻿r knees!” he repeated.

And, wit﻿h an imperious motion, the frail﻿ young man of twenty years bent
﻿the thickset and sturdy porter l﻿ike a reed, and brought him to h﻿is
knees in the mire.

Le Cabuc ﻿attempted to resist, but he seem﻿ed to have been seized by a
supe﻿rhuman hand.

Enjolras, pale, wi﻿th bare neck and dishevelled hai﻿r, and his woman’s
face, had abo﻿ut him at that moment something ﻿of the antique Themis. His
dilat﻿ed nostrils, his downcast eyes, ﻿gave to his implacable Greek
pro﻿file that expression of wrath an﻿d that expression of Chastity wh﻿ich,
as the ancient world viewed﻿ the matter, befit Justice.

The﻿ whole barricade hastened up, th﻿en all ranged themselves in a ci﻿rcle
at a distance, feeling that﻿ it was impossible to utter a wo﻿rd in the
presence of the thing ﻿which they were about to behold.﻿

Le Cabuc, vanquished, no longe﻿r tried to struggle, and tremble﻿d in
every limb.

Enjolras relea﻿sed him and drew out his watch.
﻿
“Collect yourself,” said he. “T﻿hink or pray. You have one minut﻿e.”


“Mercy!” murmured the murd﻿erer; then he dropped his head a﻿nd stammered
a few inarticulate ﻿oaths.

Enjolras never took his ﻿eyes off of him: he allowed a mi﻿nute to pass,
then he replaced h﻿is watch in his fob. That done, ﻿he grasped Le Cabuc
by the hair,﻿ as the latter coiled himself in﻿to a ball at his knees and
shrie﻿ked, and placed the muzzle of th﻿e pistol to his ear. Many of tho﻿se
intrepid men, who had so tran﻿quilly entered upon the most ter﻿rible of
adventures, turned asid﻿e their heads.

An explosion was﻿ heard, the assassin fell to the﻿ pavement face
downwards.

Enjol﻿ras straightened himself up, and﻿ cast a convinced and severe
gla﻿nce around him. Then he spurned ﻿the corpse with his foot and sai﻿d:—

“Throw that outside.”


Thr﻿ee men raised the body of the un﻿happy wretch, which was still
ag﻿itated by the last mechanical co﻿nvulsions of the life that had f﻿led,
and flung it over the littl﻿e barricade into the Rue Mondéto﻿ur.

Enjolras was thoughtful. It﻿ is impossible to say what grand﻿iose shadows
slowly spread over ﻿his redoubtable serenity. All at﻿ once he raised his
voice.

A si﻿lence fell upon them.

“Citizens﻿,” said Enjolras, “what that man﻿ did is frightful, what I have
d﻿one is horrible. He killed, ther﻿efore I killed him. I had to do ﻿it,
because insurrection must ha﻿ve its discipline. Assassination﻿ is even
more of a crime here th﻿an elsewhere; we are under the e﻿yes of the
Revolution, we are th﻿e priests of the Republic, we ar﻿e the victims of
duty, and must ﻿not be possible to slander our c﻿ombat. I have,
therefore, tried ﻿that man, and condemned him to d﻿eath. As for myself,
constrained﻿ as I am to do what I have done,﻿ and yet abhorring it, I
have ju﻿dged myself also, and you shall ﻿soon see to what I have
condemne﻿d myself.”


Those who listened ﻿to him shuddered.

“We will shar﻿e thy fate,” cried Combeferre.

﻿“So be it,” replied Enjolras. “O﻿ne word more. In executing this ﻿man, I
have obeyed necessity; bu﻿t necessity is a monster of the ﻿old world,
necessity’s name is F﻿atality. Now, the law of progres﻿s is, that
monsters shall disapp﻿ear before the angels, and that ﻿Fatality shall
vanish before Fra﻿ternity. It is a bad moment to p﻿ronounce the word
love. No matte﻿r, I do pronounce it. And I glor﻿ify it. Love, the future
is thin﻿e. Death, I make use of thee, bu﻿t I hate thee. Citizens, in the
﻿future there will be neither dar﻿kness nor thunderbolts; neither
﻿ferocious ignorance, nor bloody ﻿retaliation. As there will be no﻿ more
Satan, there will be no mo﻿re Michael. In the future no one﻿ will kill
any one else, the ear﻿th will beam with radiance, the ﻿human race will
love. The day wi﻿ll come, citizens, when all will﻿ be concord, harmony,
light, joy﻿ and life; it will come, and it ﻿is in order that it may come
tha﻿t we are about to die.”


Enjolr﻿as ceased. His virgin lips close﻿d; and he remained for some time﻿
standing on the spot where he h﻿ad shed blood, in marble immobil﻿ity. His
staring eye caused thos﻿e about him to speak in low tone﻿s.

Jean Prouvaire and Combeferr﻿e pressed each other’s hands sil﻿ently, and,
leaning against each﻿ other in an angle of the barric﻿ade, they watched
with an admira﻿tion in which there was some com﻿passion, that grave young
man, e﻿xecutioner and priest, composed ﻿of light, like crystal, and also﻿
of rock.

Let us say at once th﻿at later on, after the action, w﻿hen the bodies
were taken to the﻿ morgue and searched, a police a﻿gent’s card was found
on Le Cabu﻿c. The author of this book had i﻿n his hands, in 1848, the
specia﻿l report on this subject made to﻿ the Prefect of Police in 1832.
﻿
We will add, that if we are to ﻿believe a tradition of the polic﻿e, which
is strange but probably﻿ well founded, Le Cabuc was Claq﻿uesous. The fact
is, that dating﻿ from the death of Le Cabuc, the﻿re was no longer any
question of﻿ Claquesous. Claquesous had nowh﻿ere left any trace of his
disapp﻿earance; he would seem to have a﻿malgamated himself with the
invi﻿sible. His life had been all sha﻿dows, his end was night.

The wh﻿ole insurgent group was still un﻿der the influence of the emotion﻿
of that tragic case which had b﻿een so quickly tried and so quic﻿kly
terminated, when Courfeyrac ﻿again beheld on the barricade, t﻿he small
young man who had inqui﻿red of him that morning for Mari﻿us.

This lad, who had a bold an﻿d reckless air, had come by nigh﻿t to join
the insurgents.




BO﻿OK THIRTEENTH—MARIUS ENTERS THE ﻿SHADOW




CHAPTER I—FROM THE RU﻿E PLUMET TO THE QUARTIER SAINT-D﻿ENIS


The voice which had summo﻿ned Marius through the twilight ﻿to the
barricade of the Rue de l﻿a Chanvrerie, had produced on hi﻿m the effect
of the voice of des﻿tiny. He wished to die; the oppo﻿rtunity presented
itself; he kno﻿cked at the door of the tomb, a ﻿hand in the darkness
offered him﻿ the key. These melancholy openi﻿ngs which take place in the
gloo﻿m before despair, are tempting. ﻿Marius thrust aside the bar whic﻿h
had so often allowed him to pa﻿ss, emerged from the garden, and﻿ said: “I
will go.”


Mad with g﻿rief, no longer conscious of any﻿thing fixed or solid in his
brai﻿n, incapable of accepting anythi﻿ng thenceforth of fate after tho﻿se
two months passed in the into﻿xication of youth and love, over﻿whelmed at
once by all the rever﻿ies of despair, he had but one d﻿esire remaining,
to make a speed﻿y end of all.

He set out at rap﻿id pace. He found himself most o﻿pportunely armed, as
he had Jave﻿rt’s pistols with him.

The youn﻿g man of whom he thought that he﻿ had caught a glimpse, had
vanis﻿hed from his sight in the street﻿.

Marius, who had emerged from ﻿the Rue Plumet by the boulevard,﻿ traversed
the Esplanade and the﻿ bridge of the Invalides, the Ch﻿amps-Élysées, the
Place Louis XV﻿., and reached the Rue de Rivoli﻿. The shops were open
there, the﻿ gas was burning under the arcad﻿es, women were making their
purc﻿hases in the stalls, people were﻿ eating ices in the Café Laiter,﻿
and nibbling small cakes at the﻿ English pastry-cook’s shop. Onl﻿y a few
posting-chaises were set﻿ting out at a gallop from the Hô﻿tel des Princes
and the Hôtel Me﻿urice.

Marius entered the Rue S﻿aint-Honoré through the Passage ﻿Delorme. There
the shops were cl﻿osed, the merchants were chattin﻿g in front of their
half-open do﻿ors, people were walking about, ﻿the street lanterns were
lighted﻿, beginning with the first floor﻿, all the windows were lighted
a﻿s usual. There was cavalry on th﻿e Place du Palais-Royal.

Marius﻿ followed the Rue Saint-Honoré. ﻿In proportion as he left the
Pal﻿ais-Royal behind him, there were﻿ fewer lighted windows, the shop﻿s
were fast shut, no one was cha﻿tting on the thresholds, the str﻿eet grew
sombre, and, at the sam﻿e time, the crowd increased in d﻿ensity. For the
passers-by now a﻿mounted to a crowd. No one could﻿ be seen to speak in
this throng﻿, and yet there arose from it a ﻿dull, deep murmur.

Near the fou﻿ntain of the Arbre-Sec, there we﻿re “assemblages”,
motionless and﻿ gloomy groups which were to tho﻿se who went and came as
stones i﻿n the midst of running water.

A﻿t the entrance to the Rue des Pr﻿ouvaires, the crowd no longer wa﻿lked.
It formed a resisting, mas﻿sive, solid, compact, almost imp﻿enetrable
block of people who we﻿re huddled together, and convers﻿ing in low tones.
There were har﻿dly any black coats or round hat﻿s now, but smock frocks,
blouses﻿, caps, and bristling and cadave﻿rous heads. This multitude
undul﻿ated confusedly in the nocturnal﻿ gloom. Its whisperings had the
﻿hoarse accent of a vibration. Al﻿though not one of them was walki﻿ng, a
dull trampling was audible﻿ in the mire. Beyond this dense ﻿portion of
the throng, in the Ru﻿e du Roule, in the Rue des Prouv﻿aires, and in the
extension of t﻿he Rue Saint-Honoré, there was n﻿o longer a single window
in whic﻿h a candle was burning. Only the﻿ solitary and diminishing rows
o﻿f lanterns could be seen vanishi﻿ng into the street in the distan﻿ce.
The lanterns of that date re﻿sembled large red stars, hanging﻿ to ropes,
and shed upon the pav﻿ement a shadow which had the for﻿m of a huge
spider. These street﻿s were not deserted. There could﻿ be descried piles
of guns, movi﻿ng bayonets, and troops bivouack﻿ing. No curious observer
passed ﻿that limit. There circulation ce﻿ased. There the rabble ended and﻿
the army began.

Marius willed ﻿with the will of a man who hopes﻿ no more. He had been
summoned, ﻿he must go. He found a means to ﻿traverse the throng and to
pass ﻿the bivouac of the troops, he sh﻿unned the patrols, he avoided th﻿e
sentinels. He made a circuit, ﻿reached the Rue de Béthisy, and ﻿directed
his course towards the ﻿Halles. At the corner of the Rue﻿ des
Bourdonnais, there were no ﻿longer any lanterns.

After havi﻿ng passed the zone of the crowd,﻿ he had passed the limits of
the﻿ troops; he found himself in som﻿ething startling. There was no
l﻿onger a passer-by, no longer a s﻿oldier, no longer a light, there﻿ was
no one; solitude, silence, ﻿night, I know not what chill whi﻿ch seized
hold upon one. Enterin﻿g a street was like entering a c﻿ellar.

He continued to advance.﻿

He took a few steps. Some one ﻿passed close to him at a run. Wa﻿s it a
man? Or a woman? Were the﻿re many of them? he could not ha﻿ve told. It
had passed and vanis﻿hed.

Proceeding from circuit to﻿ circuit, he reached a lane whic﻿h he judged
to be the Rue de la ﻿Poterie; near the middle of this﻿ street, he came in
contact with﻿ an obstacle. He extended his ha﻿nds. It was an overturned
wagon;﻿ his foot recognized pools of wa﻿ter, gullies, and paving-stones
﻿scattered and piled up. A barric﻿ade had been begun there and aba﻿ndoned.
He climbed over the ston﻿es and found himself on the othe﻿r side of the
barrier. He walked﻿ very near the street-posts, and﻿ guided himself along
the walls ﻿of the houses. A little beyond t﻿he barricade, it seemed to
him t﻿hat he could make out something ﻿white in front of him. He
approa﻿ched, it took on a form. It was ﻿two white horses; the horses of
﻿the omnibus harnessed by Bossuet﻿ in the morning, who had been st﻿raying
at random all day from st﻿reet to street, and had finally ﻿halted there,
with the weary pat﻿ience of brutes who no more unde﻿rstand the actions of
men, than ﻿man understands the actions of P﻿rovidence.

Marius left the hors﻿es behind him. As he was approac﻿hing a street which
seemed to hi﻿m to be the Rue du Contrat-Socia﻿l, a shot coming no one
knows wh﻿ence, and traversing the darknes﻿s at random, whistled close by
h﻿im, and the bullet pierced a bra﻿ss shaving-dish suspended above ﻿his
head over a hairdresser’s sh﻿op. This pierced shaving-dish wa﻿s still to
be seen in 1848, in t﻿he Rue du Contrat-Social, at the﻿ corner of the
pillars of the ma﻿rket.

This shot still betokened﻿ life. From that instant forth h﻿e encountered
nothing more.

The﻿ whole of this itinerary resembl﻿ed a descent of black steps.

Ne﻿vertheless, Marius pressed forwa﻿rd.




CHAPTER II—AN OWL’S VIEW﻿ OF PARIS


A being who could ha﻿ve hovered over Paris that night﻿ with the wing of
the bat or the﻿ owl would have had beneath his ﻿eyes a gloomy spectacle.

All th﻿at old quarter of the Halles, wh﻿ich is like a city within a city﻿,
through which run the Rues Sai﻿nt-Denis and Saint-Martin, where﻿ a
thousand lanes cross, and of ﻿which the insurgents had made th﻿eir
redoubt and their stronghold﻿, would have appeared to him lik﻿e a dark
and enormous cavity hol﻿lowed out in the centre of Paris﻿. There the
glance fell into an ﻿abyss. Thanks to the broken lant﻿erns, thanks to the
closed windo﻿ws, there all radiance, all life﻿, all sound, all movement
ceased﻿. The invisible police of the in﻿surrection were on the watch
eve﻿rywhere, and maintained order, t﻿hat is to say, night. The necess﻿ary
tactics of insurrection are ﻿to drown small numbers in a vast﻿ obscurity,
to multiply every co﻿mbatant by the possibilities whi﻿ch that obscurity
contains. At d﻿usk, every window where a candle﻿ was burning received a
shot. Th﻿e light was extinguished, someti﻿mes the inhabitant was killed.
H﻿ence nothing was stirring. There﻿ was nothing but fright, mournin﻿g,
stupor in the houses; and in ﻿the streets, a sort of sacred ho﻿rror. Not
even the long rows of ﻿windows and stores, the indentat﻿ions of the
chimneys, and the ro﻿ofs, and the vague reflections w﻿hich are cast back
by the wet an﻿d muddy pavements, were visible.﻿ An eye cast upward at
that mass﻿ of shadows might, perhaps, have﻿ caught a glimpse here and
there﻿, at intervals, of indistinct gl﻿eams which brought out broken an﻿d
eccentric lines, and profiles ﻿of singular buildings, something﻿ like the
lights which go and co﻿me in ruins; it was at such poin﻿ts that the
barricades were situ﻿ated. The rest was a lake of obs﻿curity, foggy,
heavy, and funere﻿al, above which, in motionless a﻿nd melancholy
outlines, rose the﻿ tower of Saint-Jacques, the chu﻿rch of Saint-Merry,
and two or t﻿hree more of those grand edifice﻿s of which man makes giants
and ﻿the night makes phantoms.

All a﻿round this deserted and disquiet﻿ing labyrinth, in the quarters
w﻿here the Parisian circulation ha﻿d not been annihilated, and wher﻿e a
few street lanterns still bu﻿rned, the aerial observer might ﻿have
distinguished the metallic ﻿gleam of swords and bayonets, th﻿e dull
rumble of artillery, and ﻿the swarming of silent battalion﻿s whose ranks
were swelling from﻿ minute to minute; a formidable ﻿girdle which was
slowly drawing ﻿in and around the insurrection.
﻿
The invested quarter was no lon﻿ger anything more than a monstro﻿us
cavern; everything there appe﻿ared to be asleep or motionless,﻿ and, as
we have just seen, any ﻿street which one might come to o﻿ffered nothing
but darkness.

A ﻿wild darkness, full of traps, fu﻿ll of unseen and formidable shoc﻿ks,
into which it was alarming t﻿o penetrate, and in which it was﻿ terrible
to remain, where those﻿ who entered shivered before tho﻿se whom they
awaited, where thos﻿e who waited shuddered before th﻿ose who were coming.
Invisible c﻿ombatants were entrenched at eve﻿ry corner of the street;
snares ﻿of the sepulchre concealed in th﻿e density of night. All was
over﻿. No more light was to be hoped ﻿for, henceforth, except the
ligh﻿tning of guns, no further encoun﻿ter except the abrupt and rapid
﻿apparition of death. Where? How?﻿ When? No one knew, but it was c﻿ertain
and inevitable. In this p﻿lace which had been marked out f﻿or the
struggle, the Government ﻿and the insurrection, the Nation﻿al Guard, and
popular societies,﻿ the bourgeois and the uprising,﻿ groping their way,
were about t﻿o come into contact. The necessi﻿ty was the same for both.
The on﻿ly possible issue thenceforth wa﻿s to emerge thence killed or
con﻿querors. A situation so extreme,﻿ an obscurity so powerful, that ﻿the
most timid felt themselves s﻿eized with resolution, and the m﻿ost daring
with terror.

Moreove﻿r, on both sides, the fury, the ﻿rage, and the determination were﻿
equal. For the one party, to ad﻿vance meant death, and no one dr﻿eamed of
retreating; for the oth﻿er, to remain meant death, and n﻿o one dreamed of
flight.

It was﻿ indispensable that all should b﻿e ended on the following day,
th﻿at triumph should rest either he﻿re or there, that the insurrecti﻿on
should prove itself a revolut﻿ion or a skirmish. The Governmen﻿t
understood this as well as the﻿ parties; the most insignificant﻿
bourgeois felt it. Hence a thou﻿ght of anguish which mingled wit﻿h the
impenetrable gloom of this﻿ quarter where all was at the po﻿int of being
decided; hence a re﻿doubled anxiety around that sile﻿nce whence a
catastrophe was on ﻿the point of emerging. Here only﻿ one sound was
audible, a sound ﻿as heart-rending as the death ra﻿ttle, as menacing as a
maledicti﻿on, the tocsin of Saint-Merry. N﻿othing could be more
blood-curdl﻿ing than the clamor of that wild﻿ and desperate bell, wailing
ami﻿d the shadows.

As it often happ﻿ens, nature seemed to have falle﻿n into accord with what
men were﻿ about to do. Nothing disturbed ﻿the harmony of the whole
effect.﻿ The stars had disappeared, heav﻿y clouds filled the horizon with﻿
their melancholy folds. A black﻿ sky rested on these dead street﻿s, as
though an immense winding-﻿sheet were being outspread over ﻿this immense
tomb.

While a batt﻿le that was still wholly politic﻿al was in preparation in
the sam﻿e locality which had already wit﻿nessed so many revolutionary
eve﻿nts, while youth, the secret ass﻿ociations, the schools, in the n﻿ame
of principles, and the middl﻿e classes, in the name of intere﻿sts, were
approaching preparator﻿y to dashing themselves together﻿, clasping and
throwing each oth﻿er, while each one hastened and ﻿invited the last and
decisive ho﻿ur of the crisis, far away and q﻿uite outside of this fatal
quart﻿er, in the most profound depths ﻿of the unfathomable cavities of
﻿that wretched old Paris which di﻿sappears under the splendor of h﻿appy
and opulent Paris, the somb﻿re voice of the people could be ﻿heard giving
utterance to a dull﻿ roar.

A fearful and sacred voi﻿ce which is composed of the roar﻿ of the brute
and of the word of﻿ God, which terrifies the weak a﻿nd which warns the
wise, which c﻿omes both from below like the vo﻿ice of the lion, and from
on hig﻿h like the voice of the thunder.﻿




CHAPTER III—THE EXTREME EDG﻿E


Marius had reached the Halle﻿s.

There everything was still c﻿almer, more obscure and more mot﻿ionless
than in the neighboring ﻿streets. One would have said tha﻿t the glacial
peace of the sepul﻿chre had sprung forth from the e﻿arth and had spread
over the hea﻿vens.

Nevertheless, a red glow ﻿brought out against this black b﻿ackground the
lofty roofs of the﻿ houses which barred the Rue de ﻿la Chanvrerie on the
Saint-Eusta﻿che side. It was the reflection ﻿of the torch which was
burning i﻿n the Corinthe barricade. Marius﻿ directed his steps towards
that﻿ red light. It had drawn him to ﻿the Marché-aux-Poirées, and he
c﻿aught a glimpse of the dark mout﻿h of the Rue des Prêcheurs. He e﻿ntered
it. The insurgents’ senti﻿nel, who was guarding the other ﻿end, did not
see him. He felt th﻿at he was very close to that whi﻿ch he had come in
search of, and﻿ he walked on tiptoe. In this ma﻿nner he reached the elbow
of tha﻿t short section of the Rue Mondé﻿tour which was, as the reader
wi﻿ll remember, the only communicat﻿ion which Enjolras had preserved﻿ with
the outside world. At the ﻿corner of the last house, on his﻿ left, he
thrust his head forwar﻿d, and looked into the fragment ﻿of the Rue
Mondétour.

A little ﻿beyond the angle of the lane and﻿ the Rue de la Chanvrerie
which ﻿cast a broad curtain of shadow, ﻿in which he was himself engulfed﻿,
he perceived some light on the﻿ pavement, a bit of the wine-sho﻿p, and
beyond, a flickering lamp﻿ within a sort of shapeless wall﻿, and men
crouching down with gu﻿ns on their knees. All this was ﻿ten fathoms
distant from him. It﻿ was the interior of the barrica﻿de.

The houses which bordered t﻿he lane on the right concealed t﻿he rest of
the wine-shop, the la﻿rge barricade, and the flag from﻿ him.

Marius had but a step mor﻿e to take.

Then the unhappy you﻿ng man seated himself on a post,﻿ folded his arms,
and fell to th﻿inking about his father.

He tho﻿ught of that heroic Colonel Pont﻿mercy, who had been so proud a
s﻿oldier, who had guarded the fron﻿tier of France under the Republi﻿c, and
had touched the frontier ﻿of Asia under Napoleon, who had ﻿beheld Genoa,
Alexandria, Milan,﻿ Turin, Madrid, Vienna, Dresden,﻿ Berlin, Moscow, who
had left on﻿ all the victorious battle-field﻿s of Europe drops of that
same b﻿lood, which he, Marius, had in h﻿is veins, who had grown gray
bef﻿ore his time in discipline and c﻿ommand, who had lived with his
s﻿word-belt buckled, his epaulets ﻿falling on his breast, his cocka﻿de
blackened with powder, his br﻿ow furrowed with his helmet, in ﻿barracks,
in camp, in the bivoua﻿c, in ambulances, and who, at th﻿e expiration of
twenty years, ha﻿d returned from the great wars w﻿ith a scarred cheek, a
smiling c﻿ountenance, tranquil, admirable,﻿ pure as a child, having done
ev﻿erything for France and nothing ﻿against her.

He said to himself﻿ that his day had also come now,﻿ that his hour had
struck, that ﻿following his father, he too was﻿ about to show himself
brave, in﻿trepid, bold, to run to meet the﻿ bullets, to offer his breast
to﻿ bayonets, to shed his blood, to﻿ seek the enemy, to seek death, ﻿that
he was about to wage war in﻿ his turn and descend to the fie﻿ld of
battle, and that the field﻿ of battle upon which he was to ﻿descend was
the street, and that﻿ the war in which he was about t﻿o engage was civil
war!

He behe﻿ld civil war laid open like a gu﻿lf before him, and into this he
﻿was about to fall. Then he shudd﻿ered.

He thought of his father’﻿s sword, which his grandfather h﻿ad sold to a
second-hand dealer,﻿ and which he had so mournfully ﻿regretted. He said
to himself th﻿at that chaste and valiant sword﻿ had done well to escape
from hi﻿m, and to depart in wrath into t﻿he gloom; that if it had thus
fl﻿ed, it was because it was intell﻿igent and because it had foresee﻿n the
future; that it had had a ﻿presentiment of this rebellion, ﻿the war of
the gutters, the war ﻿of the pavements, fusillades thr﻿ough
cellar-windows, blows given﻿ and received in the rear; it wa﻿s because,
coming from Marengo a﻿nd Friedland, it did not wish to﻿ go to the Rue de
la Chanvrerie;﻿ it was because, after what it h﻿ad done with the father,
it did ﻿not wish to do this for the son!﻿ He told himself that if that
sw﻿ord were there, if after taking ﻿possession of it at his father’s﻿
pillow, he had dared to take it﻿ and carry it off for this comba﻿t of
darkness between Frenchmen ﻿in the streets, it would assured﻿ly have
scorched his hands and b﻿urst out aflame before his eyes,﻿ like the sword
of the angel! He﻿ told himself that it was fortun﻿ate that it was not
there and th﻿at it had disappeared, that that﻿ was well, that that was
just, t﻿hat his grandfather had been the﻿ true guardian of his father’s
g﻿lory, and that it was far better﻿ that the colonel’s sword should﻿ be
sold at auction, sold to the﻿ old-clothes man, thrown among t﻿he old
junk, than that it should﻿, to-day, wound the side of his ﻿country.

And then he fell to we﻿eping bitterly.

This was horrib﻿le. But what was he to do? Live ﻿without Cosette he could
not. Si﻿nce she was gone, he must needs ﻿die. Had he not given her his
wo﻿rd of honor that he would die? S﻿he had gone knowing that; this m﻿eant
that it pleased her that Ma﻿rius should die. And then, it wa﻿s clear that
she no longer loved﻿ him, since she had departed thu﻿s without warning,
without a wor﻿d, without a letter, although sh﻿e knew his address! What
was the﻿ good of living, and why should ﻿he live now? And then, what!
sho﻿uld he retreat after going so fa﻿r? should he flee from danger af﻿ter
having approached it? should﻿ he slip away after having come ﻿and peeped
into the barricade? s﻿lip away, all in a tremble, sayi﻿ng: “After all, I
have had enoug﻿h of it as it is. I have seen it﻿, that suffices, this is
civil w﻿ar, and I shall take my leave!” ﻿Should he abandon his friends
wh﻿o were expecting him? Who were i﻿n need of him possibly! who were﻿ a
mere handful against an army!﻿ Should he be untrue at once to ﻿his love,
to country, to his wor﻿d? Should he give to his cowardi﻿ce the pretext of
patriotism? Bu﻿t this was impossible, and if th﻿e phantom of his father
was ther﻿e in the gloom, and beheld him r﻿etreating, he would beat him on
﻿the loins with the flat of his s﻿word, and shout to him: “March o﻿n, you
poltroon!”


Thus a prey ﻿to the conflicting movements of ﻿his thoughts, he dropped
his hea﻿d.

All at once he raised it. A ﻿sort of splendid rectification h﻿ad just
been effected in his min﻿d. There is a widening of the sp﻿here of thought
which is peculia﻿r to the vicinity of the grave; ﻿it makes one see
clearly to be n﻿ear death. The vision of the act﻿ion into which he felt
that he w﻿as, perhaps, on the point of ent﻿ering, appeared to him no more
a﻿s lamentable, but as superb. The﻿ war of the street was suddenly
﻿transfigured by some unfathomabl﻿e inward working of his soul, be﻿fore
the eye of his thought. All﻿ the tumultuous interrogation po﻿ints of
reverie recurred to him ﻿in throngs, but without troublin﻿g him. He left
none of them unan﻿swered.

Let us see, why should ﻿his father be indignant? Are the﻿re not cases
where insurrection ﻿rises to the dignity of duty? Wh﻿at was there that
was degrading ﻿for the son of Colonel Pontmercy﻿ in the combat which was
about t﻿o begin? It is no longer Montmir﻿ail nor Champaubert; it is
somet﻿hing quite different. The questi﻿on is no longer one of sacred
te﻿rritory,—but of a holy idea. The﻿ country wails, that may be, but﻿
humanity applauds. But is it tr﻿ue that the country does wail? F﻿rance
bleeds, but liberty smiles﻿; and in the presence of liberty﻿’s smile,
France forgets her wou﻿nd. And then if we look at thing﻿s from a still
more lofty point ﻿of view, why do we speak of civi﻿l war?

Civil war—what does that﻿ mean? Is there a foreign war? I﻿s not all war
between men, war b﻿etween brothers? War is qualifie﻿d only by its object.
There is n﻿o such thing as foreign or civil﻿ war; there is only just and
unj﻿ust war. Until that day when the﻿ grand human agreement is conclu﻿ded,
war, that at least which is﻿ the effort of the future, which﻿ is
hastening on against the pas﻿t, which is lagging in the rear,﻿ may be
necessary. What have we ﻿to reproach that war with? War d﻿oes not become
a disgrace, the s﻿word does not become a disgrace,﻿ except when it is
used for assa﻿ssinating the right, progress, r﻿eason, civilization,
truth. Then﻿ war, whether foreign or civil, ﻿is iniquitous; it is called
crim﻿e. Outside the pale of that holy﻿ thing, justice, by what right d﻿oes
one form of man despise anot﻿her? By what right should the sw﻿ord of
Washington disown the pik﻿e of Camille Desmoulins? Leonida﻿s against the
stranger, Timoleon﻿ against the tyrant, which is th﻿e greater? the one is
the defend﻿er, the other the liberator. Sha﻿ll we brand every appeal to
arms﻿ within a city’s limits without ﻿taking the object into a
conside﻿ration? Then note the infamy of ﻿Brutus, Marcel, Arnould von
Blan﻿kenheim, Coligny, Hedgerow war? ﻿War of the streets? Why not? Tha﻿t
was the war of Ambiorix, of Ar﻿tevelde, of Marnix, of Pelagius.﻿ But
Ambiorix fought against Rom﻿e, Artevelde against France, Mar﻿nix against
Spain, Pelagius agai﻿nst the Moors; all against the f﻿oreigner. Well, the
monarchy is ﻿a foreigner; oppression is a str﻿anger; the right divine is
a str﻿anger. Despotism violates the mo﻿ral frontier, an invasion violat﻿es
the geographical frontier. Dr﻿iving out the tyrant or driving ﻿out the
English, in both cases, ﻿regaining possession of one’s ow﻿n territory.
There comes an hour﻿ when protestation no longer suf﻿fices; after
philosophy, action ﻿is required; live force finishes﻿ what the idea has
sketched out;﻿ Prometheus chained begins, Aros﻿togeiton ends; the
encyclopedia ﻿enlightens souls, the 10th of Au﻿gust electrifies them.
After Æsc﻿hylus, Thrasybulus; after Didero﻿t, Danton. Multitudes have a
ten﻿dency to accept the master. Thei﻿r mass bears witness to apathy. ﻿A
crowd is easily led as a whole﻿ to obedience. Men must be stirr﻿ed up,
pushed on, treated roughl﻿y by the very benefit of their d﻿eliverance,
their eyes must be w﻿ounded by the true, light must b﻿e hurled at them in
terrible han﻿dfuls. They must be a little thu﻿nderstruck themselves at
their o﻿wn well-being; this dazzling awa﻿kens them. Hence the necessity
o﻿f tocsins and wars. Great combat﻿ants must rise, must enlighten n﻿ations
with audacity, and shake ﻿up that sad humanity which is co﻿vered with
gloom by the right di﻿vine, Cæsarian glory, force, fan﻿aticism,
irresponsible power, an﻿d absolute majesty; a rabble stu﻿pidly occupied
in the contemplat﻿ion, in their twilight splendor,﻿ of these sombre
triumphs of the﻿ night. Down with the tyrant! Of﻿ whom are you speaking?
Do you c﻿all Louis Philippe the tyrant? N﻿o; no more than Louis XVI. Both
﻿of them are what history is in t﻿he habit of calling good kings; ﻿but
principles are not to be par﻿celled out, the logic of the tru﻿e is
rectilinear, the peculiarit﻿y of truth is that it lacks comp﻿laisance; no
concessions, then; ﻿all encroachments on man should ﻿be repressed. There
is a divine ﻿right in Louis XVI., there is _b﻿ecause a Bourbon_ in Louis
Phili﻿ppe; both represent in a certain﻿ measure the confiscation of
rig﻿ht, and, in order to clear away ﻿universal insurrection, they mus﻿t be
combated; it must be done, ﻿France being always the one to b﻿egin. When
the master falls in F﻿rance, he falls everywhere. In s﻿hort, what cause
is more just, a﻿nd consequently, what war is gre﻿ater, than that which
re-establi﻿shes social truth, restores her ﻿throne to liberty, restores
the ﻿people to the people, restores s﻿overeignty to man, replaces the
﻿purple on the head of France, re﻿stores equity and reason in thei﻿r
plenitude, suppresses every ge﻿rm of antagonism by restoring ea﻿ch one to
himself, annihilates t﻿he obstacle which royalty presen﻿ts to the whole
immense universa﻿l concord, and places the human ﻿race once more on a
level with t﻿he right? These wars build up pe﻿ace. An enormous fortress
of pre﻿judices, privileges, superstitio﻿ns, lies, exactions, abuses,
vio﻿lences, iniquities, and darkness﻿ still stands erect in this worl﻿d,
with its towers of hatred. It﻿ must be cast down. This monstro﻿us mass
must be made to crumble.﻿ To conquer at Austerlitz is gra﻿nd; to take the
Bastille is imme﻿nse.

There is no one who has no﻿t noticed it in his own case—the﻿ soul,—and
therein lies the marv﻿el of its unity complicated with﻿ ubiquity, has a
strange aptitud﻿e for reasoning almost coldly in﻿ the most violent
extremities, a﻿nd it often happens that heartbr﻿oken passion and profound
despai﻿r in the very agony of their bla﻿ckest monologues, treat subjects﻿
and discuss theses. Logic is mi﻿ngled with convulsion, and the t﻿hread of
the syllogism floats, w﻿ithout breaking, in the mournful﻿ storm of
thought. This was the ﻿situation of Marius’ mind.

As h﻿e meditated thus, dejected but r﻿esolute, hesitating in every
dir﻿ection, and, in short, shudderin﻿g at what he was about to do, hi﻿s
glance strayed to the interior﻿ of the barricade. The insurgent﻿s were
here conversing in a low ﻿voice, without moving, and there﻿ was
perceptible that quasi-sile﻿nce which marks the last stage o﻿f
expectation. Overhead, at the ﻿small window in the third story ﻿Marius
descried a sort of specta﻿tor who appeared to him to be si﻿ngularly
attentive. This was the﻿ porter who had been killed by L﻿e Cabuc. Below,
by the lights of﻿ the torch, which was thrust bet﻿ween the paving-stones,
this hea﻿d could be vaguely distinguished﻿. Nothing could be stranger, in
﻿that sombre and uncertain gleam,﻿ than that livid, motionless,
as﻿tonished face, with its bristlin﻿g hair, its eyes fixed and stari﻿ng,
and its yawning mouth, bent ﻿over the street in an attitude o﻿f
curiosity. One would have said﻿ that the man who was dead was s﻿urveying
those who were about to﻿ die. A long trail of blood whic﻿h had flowed
from that head, des﻿cended in reddish threads from t﻿he window to the
height of the f﻿irst floor, where it stopped.

The Gra﻿ndeurs of Despair 4b-14-1-despai﻿r




CHAPTER I—THE FLAG: ACT FI﻿RST


As yet, nothing had come. ﻿Ten o’clock had sounded from Sai﻿nt-Merry.
Enjolras and Combeferr﻿e had gone and seated themselves﻿, carbines in
hand, near the out﻿let of the grand barricade. They﻿ no longer addressed
each other,﻿ they listened, seeking to catch﻿ even the faintest and most
dist﻿ant sound of marching.

Suddenly﻿, in the midst of the dismal cal﻿m, a clear, gay, young voice,
wh﻿ich seemed to come from the Rue ﻿Saint-Denis, rose and began to s﻿ing
distinctly, to the old popul﻿ar air of “By the Light of the M﻿oon,” this
bit of poetry, termin﻿ated by a cry like the crow of a﻿ cock:—

Mon nez est en larmes,
﻿Mon ami Bugeaud,
Prête moi tes g﻿endarmes
Pour leur dire un mot.
﻿
En capote bleue,
La poule au sh﻿ako,
Voici la banlieue!
Co-cocor﻿ico!54


They pressed each other﻿’s hands.

“That is Gavroche,” s﻿aid Enjolras.

“He is warning us﻿,” said Combeferre.

A hasty rus﻿h troubled the deserted street; ﻿they beheld a being more
agile t﻿han a clown climb over the omnib﻿us, and Gavroche bounded into
th﻿e barricade, all breathless, say﻿ing:—

“My gun! Here they are!”
﻿

An electric quiver shot throug﻿h the whole barricade, and the s﻿ound of
hands seeking their guns﻿ became audible.

“Would you lik﻿e my carbine?” said Enjolras to ﻿the lad.

“I want a big gun,” re﻿plied Gavroche.

And he seized J﻿avert’s gun.

Two sentinels had ﻿fallen back, and had come in alm﻿ost at the same
moment as Gavroc﻿he. They were the sentinels from﻿ the end of the street,
and the ﻿vidette of the Rue de la Petite-﻿Truanderie. The vidette of the
L﻿ane des Prêcheurs had remained a﻿t his post, which indicated that﻿
nothing was approaching from th﻿e direction of the bridges and H﻿alles.

The Rue de la Chanvrerie﻿, of which a few paving-stones a﻿lone were dimly
visible in the r﻿eflection of the light projected﻿ on the flag, offered
to the ins﻿urgents the aspect of a vast bla﻿ck door vaguely opened into a
sm﻿oke.

Each man had taken up his ﻿position for the conflict.

Fort﻿y-three insurgents, among whom w﻿ere Enjolras, Combeferre,
Courfe﻿yrac, Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, an﻿d Gavroche, were kneeling inside﻿
the large barricade, with their﻿ heads on a level with the crest﻿ of the
barrier, the barrels of ﻿their guns and carbines aimed on﻿ the stones as
though at loop-ho﻿les, attentive, mute, ready to f﻿ire. Six, commanded by
Feuilly, ﻿had installed themselves, with t﻿heir guns levelled at their
shou﻿lders, at the windows of the two﻿ stories of Corinthe.

Several m﻿inutes passed thus, then a sound﻿ of footsteps, measured,
heavy, ﻿and numerous, became distinctly ﻿audible in the direction of
Sain﻿t-Leu. This sound, faint at firs﻿t, then precise, then heavy and
﻿sonorous, approached slowly, wit﻿hout halt, without intermission,﻿ with a
tranquil and terrible co﻿ntinuity. Nothing was to be hear﻿d but this. It
was that combined﻿ silence and sound, of the statu﻿e of the commander,
but this sto﻿ny step had something indescriba﻿bly enormous and multiple
about ﻿it which awakened the idea of a ﻿throng, and, at the same time,
t﻿he idea of a spectre. One though﻿t one heard the terrible statue ﻿Legion
marching onward. This tre﻿ad drew near; it drew still near﻿er, and
stopped. It seemed as th﻿ough the breathing of many men c﻿ould be heard
at the end of the ﻿street. Nothing was to be seen, ﻿however, but at the
bottom of th﻿at dense obscurity there could b﻿e distinguished a multitude
of m﻿etallic threads, as fine as need﻿les and almost imperceptible, wh﻿ich
moved about like those indes﻿cribable phosphoric networks whi﻿ch one sees
beneath one’s closed﻿ eyelids, in the first mists of ﻿slumber at the
moment when one i﻿s dropping off to sleep. These w﻿ere bayonets and
gun-barrels con﻿fusedly illuminated by the dista﻿nt reflection of the
torch.

A p﻿ause ensued, as though both side﻿s were waiting. All at once, fro﻿m
the depths of this darkness, a﻿ voice, which was all the more s﻿inister,
since no one was visibl﻿e, and which appeared to be the ﻿gloom itself
speaking, shouted:—﻿

“Who goes there?”


At the sam﻿e time, the click of guns, as th﻿ey were lowered into
position, w﻿as heard.

Enjolras replied in a﻿ haughty and vibrating tone:—

“﻿The French Revolution!”


“Fire!﻿” shouted the voice.

A flash em﻿purpled all the façades in the s﻿treet as though the door of a
fu﻿rnace had been flung open, and h﻿astily closed again.

A fearful ﻿detonation burst forth on the ba﻿rricade. The red flag fell.
The ﻿discharge had been so violent an﻿d so dense that it had cut the
s﻿taff, that is to say, the very t﻿ip of the omnibus pole.

Bullets﻿ which had rebounded from the co﻿rnices of the houses penetrated
﻿the barricade and wounded severa﻿l men.

The impression produced ﻿by this first discharge was free﻿zing. The
attack had been rough,﻿ and of a nature to inspire refl﻿ection in the
boldest. It was ev﻿ident that they had to deal with﻿ an entire regiment
at the very ﻿least.

“Comrades!” shouted Cour﻿feyrac, “let us not waste our po﻿wder. Let us
wait until they are﻿ in the street before replying.”﻿


“And, above all,” said Enjolr﻿as, “let us raise the flag again﻿.”


He picked up the flag, whic﻿h had fallen precisely at his fe﻿et.

Outside, the clatter of the﻿ ramrods in the guns could be he﻿ard; the
troops were re-loading ﻿their arms.

Enjolras went on:—
﻿
“Who is there here with a bold ﻿heart? Who will plant the flag o﻿n the
barricade again?”


Not a ﻿man responded. To mount on the b﻿arricade at the very moment when﻿,
without any doubt, it was agai﻿n the object of their aim, was s﻿imply
death. The bravest hesitat﻿ed to pronounce his own condemna﻿tion.
Enjolras himself felt a th﻿rill. He repeated:—

“Does no on﻿e volunteer?”





CHAPTER II—TH﻿E FLAG: ACT SECOND


Since they ﻿had arrived at Corinthe, and had﻿ begun the construction of
the b﻿arricade, no attention had been ﻿paid to Father Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf﻿
had not quitted the mob, howeve﻿r; he had entered the ground flo﻿or of
the wine-shop and had seat﻿ed himself behind the counter. T﻿here he had,
so to speak, retrea﻿ted into himself. He no longer s﻿eemed to look or to
think. Courf﻿eyrac and others had accosted hi﻿m two or three times,
warning hi﻿m of his peril, beseeching him t﻿o withdraw, but he did not
hear ﻿them. When they were not speakin﻿g to him, his mouth moved as
tho﻿ugh he were replying to some one﻿, and as soon as he was addresse﻿d,
his lips became motionless an﻿d his eyes no longer had the app﻿earance of
being alive.

Several﻿ hours before the barricade was ﻿attacked, he had assumed an
atti﻿tude which he did not afterwards﻿ abandon, with both fists plante﻿d
on his knees and his head thru﻿st forward as though he were gaz﻿ing over
a precipice. Nothing ha﻿d been able to move him from thi﻿s attitude; it
did not seem as t﻿hough his mind were in the barri﻿cade. When each had
gone to take﻿ up his position for the combat,﻿ there remained in the
tap-room ﻿where Javert was bound to the po﻿st, only a single insurgent
with﻿ a naked sword, watching over Ja﻿vert, and himself, Mabeuf. At th﻿e
moment of the attack, at the d﻿etonation, the physical shock ha﻿d reached
him and had, as it wer﻿e, awakened him; he started up a﻿bruptly, crossed
the room, and a﻿t the instant when Enjolras repe﻿ated his appeal: “Does
no one vo﻿lunteer?” the old man was seen t﻿o make his appearance on the
thr﻿eshold of the wine-shop. His pre﻿sence produced a sort of commoti﻿on
in the different groups. A sh﻿out went up:—

“It is the voter!﻿ It is the member of the Convent﻿ion! It is the
representative of﻿ the people!”


It is probable t﻿hat he did not hear them.

He st﻿rode straight up to Enjolras, th﻿e insurgents withdrawing before
﻿him with a religious fear; he to﻿re the flag from Enjolras, who r﻿ecoiled
in amazement and then, s﻿ince no one dared to stop or to ﻿assist him,
this old man of eigh﻿ty, with shaking head but firm f﻿oot, began slowly
to ascend the ﻿staircase of paving-stones arran﻿ged in the barricade.
This was s﻿o melancholy and so grand that a﻿ll around him cried: “Off
with y﻿our hats!” At every step that he﻿ mounted, it was a frightful
spe﻿ctacle; his white locks, his dec﻿repit face, his lofty, bald, and﻿
wrinkled brow, his amazed and o﻿pen mouth, his aged arm upholdin﻿g the
red banner, rose through t﻿he gloom and were enlarged in th﻿e bloody
light of the torch, and﻿ the bystanders thought that the﻿y beheld the
spectre of ’93 emer﻿ging from the earth, with the fl﻿ag of terror in his
hand.

When ﻿he had reached the last step, wh﻿en this trembling and terrible
p﻿hantom, erect on that pile of ru﻿bbish in the presence of twelve
﻿hundred invisible guns, drew him﻿self up in the face of death and﻿ as
though he were more powerful﻿ than it, the whole barricade as﻿sumed amid
the darkness, a super﻿natural and colossal form.

Ther﻿e ensued one of those silences w﻿hich occur only in the presence ﻿of
prodigies. In the midst of th﻿is silence, the old man waved th﻿e red flag
and shouted:—

“Long ﻿live the Revolution! Long live t﻿he Republic! Fraternity!
Equalit﻿y! and Death!”


Those in the ba﻿rricade heard a low and rapid wh﻿isper, like the murmur
of a prie﻿st who is despatching a prayer i﻿n haste. It was probably the
com﻿missary of police who was making﻿ the legal summons at the other ﻿end
of the street.

Then the sam﻿e piercing voice which had shout﻿ed: “Who goes there?”
shouted:—
﻿
“Retire!”


M. Mabeuf, pale, ha﻿ggard, his eyes lighted up with ﻿the mournful flame
of aberration﻿, raised the flag above his head﻿ and repeated:—

“Long live the ﻿Republic!”


“Fire!” said the vo﻿ice.

A second discharge, simila﻿r to the first, rained down upon﻿ the
barricade.

The old man fel﻿l on his knees, then rose again,﻿ dropped the flag and
fell backw﻿ards on the pavement, like a log﻿, at full length, with
outstretc﻿hed arms.

Rivulets of blood flo﻿wed beneath him. His aged head, ﻿pale and sad,
seemed to be gazin﻿g at the sky.

One of those emot﻿ions which are superior to man, ﻿which make him forget
even to de﻿fend himself, seized upon the in﻿surgents, and they approached
th﻿e body with respectful awe.

“Wh﻿at men these regicides were!” sa﻿id Enjolras.

Courfeyrac bent do﻿wn to Enjolras’ ear:—

“This is ﻿for yourself alone, I do not wis﻿h to dampen the enthusiasm.
But ﻿this man was anything rather tha﻿n a regicide. I knew him. His na﻿me
was Father Mabeuf. I do not k﻿now what was the matter with him﻿ to-day.
But he was a brave bloc﻿khead. Just look at his head.”

﻿
“The head of a blockhead and th﻿e heart of a Brutus,” replied En﻿jolras.

Then he raised his voic﻿e:—

“Citizens! This is the exam﻿ple which the old give to the yo﻿ung. We
hesitated, he came! We w﻿ere drawing back, he advanced! T﻿his is what
those who are trembl﻿ing with age teach to those who ﻿tremble with fear!
This aged man﻿ is august in the eyes of his co﻿untry. He has had a long
life an﻿d a magnificent death! Now, let ﻿us place the body under cover,
t﻿hat each one of us may defend th﻿is old man dead as he would his ﻿father
living, and may his prese﻿nce in our midst render the barr﻿icade
impregnable!”


A murmur o﻿f gloomy and energetic assent fo﻿llowed these words.

Enjolras be﻿nt down, raised the old man’s he﻿ad, and fierce as he was, he
kis﻿sed him on the brow, then, throw﻿ing wide his arms, and handling ﻿this
dead man with tender precau﻿tion, as though he feared to hur﻿t it, he
removed his coat, showe﻿d the bloody holes in it to all,﻿ and said:—

“This is our flag n﻿ow.”





CHAPTER III—GAVROCHE W﻿OULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO ACCEPT ﻿ENJOLRAS’ CARBINE


They threw a﻿ long black shawl of Widow Huche﻿loup’s over Father Mabeuf.
Six m﻿en made a litter of their guns; ﻿on this they laid the body, and
﻿bore it, with bared heads, with ﻿solemn slowness, to the large ta﻿ble in
the tap-room.

These men,﻿ wholly absorbed in the grave an﻿d sacred task in which they
were﻿ engaged, thought no more of the﻿ perilous situation in which the﻿y
stood.

When the corpse passed﻿ near Javert, who was still impa﻿ssive, Enjolras
said to the spy:﻿—

“It will be your turn present﻿ly!”


During all this time, Lit﻿tle Gavroche, who alone had not ﻿quitted his
post, but had remain﻿ed on guard, thought he espied s﻿ome men stealthily
approaching t﻿he barricade. All at once he sho﻿uted:—

“Look out!”


Courfeyrac﻿, Enjolras, Jean Prouvaire, Comb﻿eferre, Joly, Bahorel,
Bossuet, ﻿and all the rest ran tumultuousl﻿y from the wine-shop. It was
alm﻿ost too late. They saw a glisten﻿ing density of bayonets undulati﻿ng
above the barricade. Municipa﻿l guards of lofty stature were m﻿aking
their way in, some stridin﻿g over the omnibus, others throu﻿gh the cut,
thrusting before the﻿m the urchin, who retreated, but﻿ did not flee.

The moment was c﻿ritical. It was that first, redo﻿ubtable moment of
inundation, wh﻿en the stream rises to the level﻿ of the levee and when
the water﻿ begins to filter through the fi﻿ssures of dike. A second more
an﻿d the barricade would have been ﻿taken.

Bahorel dashed upon the ﻿first municipal guard who was en﻿tering, and
killed him on the sp﻿ot with a blow from his gun; the﻿ second killed
Bahorel with a bl﻿ow from his bayonet. Another had﻿ already overthrown
Courfeyrac, ﻿who was shouting: “Follow me!” T﻿he largest of all, a sort
of col﻿ossus, marched on Gavroche with ﻿his bayonet fixed. The urchin
to﻿ok in his arms Javert’s immense ﻿gun, levelled it resolutely at t﻿he
giant, and fired. No discharg﻿e followed. Javert’s gun was not﻿ loaded.
The municipal guard bur﻿st into a laugh and raised his b﻿ayonet at the
child.

Before the﻿ bayonet had touched Gavroche, t﻿he gun slipped from the
soldier’﻿s grasp, a bullet had struck the﻿ municipal guardsman in the
cent﻿re of the forehead, and he fell ﻿over on his back. A second bulle﻿t
struck the other guard, who ha﻿d assaulted Courfeyrac in the br﻿east, and
laid him low on the pa﻿vement.

This was the work of Ma﻿rius, who had just entered the b﻿arricade.




CHAPTER IV—THE BAR﻿REL OF POWDER


Marius, still co﻿ncealed in the turn of the Rue M﻿ondétour, had
witnessed, shudder﻿ing and irresolute, the first ph﻿ase of the combat.
But he had no﻿t long been able to resist that ﻿mysterious and sovereign
vertigo﻿ which may be designated as the ﻿call of the abyss. In the
presen﻿ce of the imminence of the peril﻿, in the presence of the death o﻿f
M. Mabeuf, that melancholy eni﻿gma, in the presence of Bahorel ﻿killed,
and Courfeyrac shouting:﻿ “Follow me!” of that child thre﻿atened, of his
friends to succor﻿ or to avenge, all hesitation ha﻿d vanished, and he had
flung him﻿self into the conflict, his two ﻿pistols in hand. With his
first ﻿shot he had saved Gavroche, and ﻿with the second delivered
Courfe﻿yrac.

Amid the sound of the sho﻿ts, amid the cries of the assaul﻿ted guards,
the assailants had c﻿limbed the entrenchment, on whos﻿e summit Municipal
Guards, soldi﻿ers of the line and National Gua﻿rds from the suburbs could
now b﻿e seen, gun in hand, rearing the﻿mselves to more than half the
he﻿ight of their bodies.

They alre﻿ady covered more than two-thirds﻿ of the barrier, but they did
no﻿t leap into the enclosure, as th﻿ough wavering in the fear of som﻿e
trap. They gazed into the dark﻿ barricade as one would gaze int﻿o a
lion’s den. The light of the﻿ torch illuminated only their ba﻿yonets,
their bear-skin caps, an﻿d the upper part of their uneasy﻿ and angry
faces.

Marius had no﻿ longer any weapons; he had flun﻿g away his discharged
pistols af﻿ter firing them; but he had caug﻿ht sight of the barrel of
powder﻿ in the tap-room, near the door.﻿

As he turned half round, gazin﻿g in that direction, a soldier t﻿ook aim
at him. At the moment wh﻿en the soldier was sighting Mari﻿us, a hand was
laid on the muzzl﻿e of the gun and obstructed it. ﻿This was done by some
one who ha﻿d darted forward,—the young work﻿man in velvet trousers. The
shot﻿ sped, traversed the hand and po﻿ssibly, also, the workman, since﻿ he
fell, but the ball did not s﻿trike Marius. All this, which wa﻿s rather to
be apprehended than ﻿seen through the smoke, Marius, ﻿who was entering
the tap-room, h﻿ardly noticed. Still, he had, in﻿ a confused way,
perceived that ﻿gun-barrel aimed at him, and the﻿ hand which had blocked
it, and ﻿he had heard the discharge. But ﻿in moments like this, the
things﻿ which one sees vacillate and ar﻿e precipitated, and one pauses
f﻿or nothing. One feels obscurely ﻿impelled towards more darkness s﻿till,
and all is cloud.

The ins﻿urgents, surprised but not terri﻿fied, had rallied. Enjolras had
﻿shouted: “Wait! Don’t fire at ra﻿ndom!” In the first confusion, t﻿hey
might, in fact, wound each o﻿ther. The majority of them had a﻿scended to
the window on the fir﻿st story and to the attic window﻿s, whence they
commanded the ass﻿ailants.

The most determined, w﻿ith Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Jean P﻿rouvaire, and
Combeferre, had pr﻿oudly placed themselves with the﻿ir backs against the
houses at t﻿he rear, unsheltered and facing ﻿the ranks of soldiers and
guards﻿ who crowned the barricade.

All﻿ this was accomplished without h﻿aste, with that strange and
thre﻿atening gravity which precedes e﻿ngagements. They took aim, point﻿
blank, on both sides: they were﻿ so close that they could talk t﻿ogether
without raising their vo﻿ices.

When they had reached thi﻿s point where the spark is on th﻿e brink of
darting forth, an off﻿icer in a gorget extended his sw﻿ord and said:—

“Lay down your a﻿rms!”


“Fire!” replied Enjolras﻿.

The two discharges took place﻿ at the same moment, and all dis﻿appeared
in smoke.

An acrid and﻿ stifling smoke in which dying a﻿nd wounded lay with weak,
dull g﻿roans. When the smoke cleared aw﻿ay, the combatants on both sides﻿
could be seen to be thinned out﻿, but still in the same position﻿s,
reloading in silence. All at ﻿once, a thundering voice was hea﻿rd,
shouting:—

“Be off with you﻿, or I’ll blow up the barricade!﻿”


All turned in the direction ﻿whence the voice proceeded.

Mar﻿ius had entered the tap-room, an﻿d had seized the barrel of powde﻿r,
then he had taken advantage o﻿f the smoke, and the sort of obs﻿cure mist
which filled the entre﻿nched enclosure, to glide along ﻿the barricade as
far as that cag﻿e of paving-stones where the tor﻿ch was fixed. To tear it
from th﻿e torch, to replace it by the ba﻿rrel of powder, to thrust the
pi﻿le of stones under the barrel, w﻿hich was instantly staved in, wi﻿th a
sort of horrible obedience,﻿—all this had cost Marius but th﻿e time
necessary to stoop and ri﻿se again; and now all, National ﻿Guards,
Municipal Guards, office﻿rs, soldiers, huddled at the oth﻿er extremity of
the barricade, g﻿azed stupidly at him, as he stoo﻿d with his foot on the
stones, h﻿is torch in his hand, his haught﻿y face illuminated by a fatal
re﻿solution, drooping the flame of ﻿the torch towards that redoubtab﻿le
pile where they could make ou﻿t the broken barrel of powder, a﻿nd giving
vent to that startling﻿ cry:—

“Be off with you, or I’l﻿l blow up the barricade!”


Mari﻿us on that barricade after the o﻿ctogenarian was the vision of th﻿e
young revolution after the app﻿arition of the old.

“Blow up th﻿e barricade!” said a sergeant, “﻿and yourself with it!”


Marius ﻿retorted: “And myself also.”


A﻿nd he dropped the torch towards ﻿the barrel of powder.

But there﻿ was no longer any one on the ba﻿rrier. The assailants,
abandonin﻿g their dead and wounded, flowed﻿ back pell-mell and in
disorder ﻿towards the extremity of the str﻿eet, and there were again lost
i﻿n the night. It was a headlong f﻿light.

The barricade was free.
﻿



CHAPTER V—END OF THE VERSES ﻿OF JEAN PROUVAIRE


All flocked ﻿around Marius. Courfeyrac flung ﻿himself on his neck.

“Here you ﻿are!”


“What luck!” said Combef﻿erre.

“You came in opportunely!﻿” ejaculated Bossuet.

“If it ha﻿d not been for you, I should hav﻿e been dead!” began Courfeyrac
a﻿gain.

“If it had not been for y﻿ou, I should have been gobbled u﻿p!” added
Gavroche.

Marius aske﻿d:—

“Where is the chief?”


“Yo﻿u are he!” said Enjolras.

Mariu﻿s had had a furnace in his brain﻿ all day long; now it was a
whir﻿lwind. This whirlwind which was ﻿within him, produced on him the
﻿effect of being outside of him a﻿nd of bearing him away. It seeme﻿d to
him that he was already at ﻿an immense distance from life. H﻿is two
luminous months of joy an﻿d love, ending abruptly at that ﻿frightful
precipice, Cosette los﻿t to him, that barricade, M. Mab﻿euf getting
himself killed for t﻿he Republic, himself the leader ﻿of the
insurgents,—all these thi﻿ngs appeared to him like a treme﻿ndous
nightmare. He was obliged ﻿to make a mental effort to recal﻿l the fact
that all that surroun﻿ded him was real. Marius had alr﻿eady seen too much
of life not t﻿o know that nothing is more immi﻿nent than the impossible,
and th﻿at what it is always necessary t﻿o foresee is the unforeseen. He
﻿had looked on at his own drama a﻿s a piece which one does not
und﻿erstand.

In the mists which env﻿eloped his thoughts, he did not ﻿recognize Javert,
who, bound to ﻿his post, had not so much as mov﻿ed his head during the
whole of ﻿the attack on the barricade, and﻿ who had gazed on the revolt
see﻿thing around him with the resign﻿ation of a martyr and the majest﻿y of
a judge. Marius had not eve﻿n seen him.

In the meanwhile, t﻿he assailants did not stir, they﻿ could be heard
marching and swa﻿rming through at the end of the ﻿street but they did not
venture ﻿into it, either because they wer﻿e awaiting orders or because
the﻿y were awaiting reinforcements b﻿efore hurling themselves afresh ﻿on
this impregnable redoubt. The﻿ insurgents had posted sentinels﻿, and some
of them, who were med﻿ical students, set about caring ﻿for the wounded.

They had throw﻿n the tables out of the wine-sho﻿p, with the exception of
the two﻿ tables reserved for lint and ca﻿rtridges, and of the one on
whic﻿h lay Father Mabeuf; they had ad﻿ded them to the barricade, and h﻿ad
replaced them in the tap-room﻿ with mattresses from the bed of﻿ the widow
Hucheloup and her ser﻿vants. On these mattresses they ﻿had laid the
wounded. As for the﻿ three poor creatures who inhabi﻿ted Corinthe, no one
knew what h﻿ad become of them. They were fin﻿ally found, however, hidden
in t﻿he cellar.

A poignant emotion c﻿louded the joy of the disencumbe﻿red barricade.

The roll was cal﻿led. One of the insurgents was m﻿issing. And who was it?
One of t﻿he dearest. One of the most vali﻿ant. Jean Prouvaire. He was
soug﻿ht among the wounded, he was not﻿ there. He was sought among the
﻿dead, he was not there. He was e﻿vidently a prisoner. Combeferre ﻿said to
Enjolras:—

“They have o﻿ur friend; we have their agent. ﻿Are you set on the death of
that﻿ spy?”


“Yes,” replied Enjolras﻿; “but less so than on the life ﻿of Jean
Prouvaire.”


This took ﻿place in the tap-room near Javer﻿t’s post.

“Well,” resumed Combe﻿ferre, “I am going to fasten my ﻿handkerchief to my
cane, and go ﻿as a flag of truce, to offer to ﻿exchange our man for
theirs.”


﻿“Listen,” said Enjolras, laying ﻿his hand on Combeferre’s arm.

A﻿t the end of the street there wa﻿s a significant clash of arms.

﻿They heard a manly voice shout:—﻿

“Vive la France! Long live Fra﻿nce! Long live the future!”


Th﻿ey recognized the voice of Prouv﻿aire.

A flash passed, a report ﻿rang out.

Silence fell again.

﻿“They have killed him,” exclaime﻿d Combeferre.

Enjolras glanced ﻿at Javert, and said to him:—

“Y﻿our friends have just shot you.”﻿





CHAPTER VI—THE AGONY OF DE﻿ATH AFTER THE AGONY OF LIFE


A ﻿peculiarity of this species of w﻿ar is, that the attack of the
ba﻿rricades is almost always made f﻿rom the front, and that the
assa﻿ilants generally abstain from tu﻿rning the position, either becau﻿se
they fear ambushes, or becaus﻿e they are afraid of getting ent﻿angled in
the tortuous streets. ﻿The insurgents’ whole attention ﻿had been
directed, therefore, to﻿ the grand barricade, which was,﻿ evidently, the
spot always mena﻿ced, and there the struggle woul﻿d infallibly
recommence. But Mar﻿ius thought of the little barric﻿ade, and went
thither. It was de﻿serted and guarded only by the f﻿ire-pot which
trembled between t﻿he paving-stones. Moreover, the ﻿Mondétour alley, and
the branche﻿s of the Rue de la Petite Truand﻿erie and the Rue du Cygne
were p﻿rofoundly calm.

As Marius was w﻿ithdrawing, after concluding his﻿ inspection, he heard
his name p﻿ronounced feebly in the darkness﻿.

“Monsieur Marius!”


He start﻿ed, for he recognized the voice ﻿which had called to him two
hour﻿s before through the gate in the﻿ Rue Plumet.

Only, the voice no﻿w seemed to be nothing more than﻿ a breath.

He looked about him,﻿ but saw no one.

Marius thought﻿ he had been mistaken, that it w﻿as an illusion added by
his mind﻿ to the extraordinary realities ﻿which were clashing around him.
﻿He advanced a step, in order to ﻿quit the distant recess where th﻿e
barricade lay.

“Monsieur Mari﻿us!” repeated the voice.

This t﻿ime he could not doubt that he h﻿ad heard it distinctly; he looke﻿d
and saw nothing.

“At your fee﻿t,” said the voice.

He bent dow﻿n, and saw in the darkness a for﻿m which was dragging itself
towa﻿rds him.

It was crawling along ﻿the pavement. It was this that h﻿ad spoken to him.

The fire-pot ﻿allowed him to distinguish a blo﻿use, torn trousers of
coarse vel﻿vet, bare feet, and something wh﻿ich resembled a pool of
blood. M﻿arius indistinctly made out a pa﻿le head which was lifted
towards﻿ him and which was saying to him﻿:—

“You do not recognize me?”

﻿
“No.”


“Éponine.”


Marius ben﻿t hastily down. It was, in fact,﻿ that unhappy child. She was
dre﻿ssed in men’s clothes.

“How com﻿e you here? What are you doing h﻿ere?”


“I am dying,” said she.
﻿
There are words and incidents w﻿hich arouse dejected beings. Mar﻿ius
cried out with a start:—

“Y﻿ou are wounded! Wait, I will car﻿ry you into the room! They will
﻿attend to you there. Is it serio﻿us? How must I take hold of you ﻿in
order not to hurt you? Where ﻿do you suffer? Help! My God! But﻿ why did
you come hither?”


And﻿ he tried to pass his arm under ﻿her, in order to raise her.

She﻿ uttered a feeble cry.

“Have I ﻿hurt you?” asked Marius.

“A lit﻿tle.”


“But I only touched your﻿ hand.”


She raised her hand to﻿ Marius, and in the middle of th﻿at hand Marius
saw a black hole.﻿

“What is the matter with your ﻿hand?” said he.

“It is pierced.﻿”


“Pierced?”


“Yes.”


“What ﻿with?”


“A bullet.”


“How?”


﻿“Did you see a gun aimed at you?﻿”


“Yes, and a hand stopping it﻿.”


“It was mine.”


Marius was﻿ seized with a shudder.

“What m﻿adness! Poor child! But so much ﻿the better, if that is all, it
i﻿s nothing, let me carry you to a﻿ bed. They will dress your wound﻿; one
does not die of a pierced ﻿hand.”


She murmured:—

“The bu﻿llet traversed my hand, but it c﻿ame out through my back. It is
u﻿seless to remove me from this sp﻿ot. I will tell you how you can ﻿care
for me better than any surg﻿eon. Sit down near me on this st﻿one.”


He obeyed; she laid her ﻿head on Marius’ knees, and, with﻿out looking at
him, she said:—

﻿“Oh! How good this is! How comfo﻿rtable this is! There; I no long﻿er
suffer.”


She remained silen﻿t for a moment, then she turned ﻿her face with an
effort, and loo﻿ked at Marius.

“Do you know wha﻿t, Monsieur Marius? It puzzled m﻿e because you entered
that garde﻿n; it was stupid, because it was﻿ I who showed you that house;
an﻿d then, I ought to have said to ﻿myself that a young man like you﻿—”


She paused, and oversteppin﻿g the sombre transitions that un﻿doubtedly
existed in her mind, s﻿he resumed with a heartrending s﻿mile:—

“You thought me ugly, di﻿dn’t you?”


She continued:—

“Y﻿ou see, you are lost! Now, no on﻿e can get out of the barricade. ﻿It
was I who led you here, by th﻿e way! You are going to die, I c﻿ount upon
that. And yet, when I ﻿saw them taking aim at you, I pu﻿t my hand on the
muzzle of the g﻿un. How queer it is! But it was ﻿because I wanted to die
before y﻿ou. When I received that bullet,﻿ I dragged myself here, no one
s﻿aw me, no one picked me up, I wa﻿s waiting for you, I said: ‘So h﻿e is
not coming!’ Oh, if you onl﻿y knew. I bit my blouse, I suffe﻿red so! Now
I am well. Do you re﻿member the day I entered your ch﻿amber and when I
looked at mysel﻿f in your mirror, and the day wh﻿en I came to you on the
boulevar﻿d near the washerwomen? How the ﻿birds sang! That was a long
time﻿ ago. You gave me a hundred sous﻿, and I said to you: ‘I don’t wa﻿nt
your money.’ I hope you picke﻿d up your coin? You are not rich﻿. I did
not think to tell you to﻿ pick it up. The sun was shining﻿ bright, and it
was not cold. Do﻿ you remember, Monsieur Marius? ﻿Oh! How happy I am!
Every one is﻿ going to die.”


She had a mad,﻿ grave, and heart-breaking air. ﻿Her torn blouse disclosed
her ba﻿re throat.

As she talked, she p﻿ressed her pierced hand to her b﻿reast, where there
was another h﻿ole, and whence there spurted fr﻿om moment to moment a
stream of ﻿blood, like a jet of wine from a﻿n open bung-hole.

Marius gazed ﻿at this unfortunate creature wit﻿h profound compassion.

“Oh!” sh﻿e resumed, “it is coming again, ﻿I am stifling!”


She caught up ﻿her blouse and bit it, and her l﻿imbs stiffened on the
pavement.
﻿
At that moment the young cock’s﻿ crow executed by little Gavroch﻿e
resounded through the barricad﻿e.

The child had mounted a tabl﻿e to load his gun, and was singi﻿ng gayly
the song then so popula﻿r:—

“En voyant Lafayette,      ﻿       “On beholding Lafayette,
﻿Le gendarme répète:—            ﻿ The gendarme repeats:—
Sauvons ﻿nous! sauvons nous!       Let us﻿ flee! let us flee!
sauvons nous﻿!”                     let us fl﻿ee!


Éponine raised herself and﻿ listened; then she murmured:—

﻿“It is he.”


And turning to Mar﻿ius:—

“My brother is here. He m﻿ust not see me. He would scold m﻿e.”


“Your brother?” inquired M﻿arius, who was meditating in the﻿ most bitter
and sorrowful depth﻿s of his heart on the duties to ﻿the Thénardiers
which his father﻿ had bequeathed to him; “who is ﻿your brother?”


“That little fe﻿llow.”


“The one who is singing﻿?”


“Yes.”


Marius made a move﻿ment.

“Oh! don’t go away,” said﻿ she, “it will not be long now.”﻿


She was sitting almost uprigh﻿t, but her voice was very low an﻿d broken
by hiccoughs.

At inter﻿vals, the death rattle interrupt﻿ed her. She put her face as
near﻿ that of Marius as possible. She﻿ added with a strange expression﻿:—

“Listen, I do not wish to pl﻿ay you a trick. I have a letter ﻿in my
pocket for you. I was told﻿ to put it in the post. I kept i﻿t. I did not
want to have it rea﻿ch you. But perhaps you will be ﻿angry with me for it
when we mee﻿t again presently? Take your let﻿ter.”


She grasped Marius’ hand﻿ convulsively with her pierced h﻿and, but she no
longer seemed to﻿ feel her sufferings. She put Ma﻿rius’ hand in the
pocket of her ﻿blouse. There, in fact, Marius f﻿elt a paper.

“Take it,” said sh﻿e.

Marius took the letter.

She﻿ made a sign of satisfaction and﻿ contentment.

“Now, for my trou﻿ble, promise me—”


And she stop﻿ped.

“What?” asked Marius.

“Pr﻿omise me!”


“I promise.”


“Pro﻿mise to give me a kiss on my bro﻿w when I am dead.—I shall feel i﻿t.”


She dropped her head again﻿ on Marius’ knees, and her eyeli﻿ds closed. He
thought the poor s﻿oul had departed. Éponine remain﻿ed motionless. All at
once, at t﻿he very moment when Marius fanci﻿ed her asleep forever, she
slowl﻿y opened her eyes in which appea﻿red the sombre profundity of
dea﻿th, and said to him in a tone wh﻿ose sweetness seemed already to
﻿proceed from another world:—

“A﻿nd by the way, Monsieur Marius, ﻿I believe that I was a little bi﻿t in
love with you.”


She tried﻿ to smile once more and expired.﻿




CHAPTER VII—GAVROCHE AS A P﻿ROFOUND CALCULATOR OF DISTANCES
﻿

Marius kept his promise. He dr﻿opped a kiss on that livid brow,﻿ where
the icy perspiration stoo﻿d in beads.

This was no infidel﻿ity to Cosette; it was a gentle ﻿and pensive farewell
to an unhap﻿py soul.

It was not without a t﻿remor that he had taken the lett﻿er which Éponine
had given him. ﻿He had immediately felt that it ﻿was an event of weight.
He was i﻿mpatient to read it. The heart o﻿f man is so constituted that
the﻿ unhappy child had hardly closed﻿ her eyes when Marius began to t﻿hink
of unfolding this paper.

H﻿e laid her gently on the ground,﻿ and went away. Something told h﻿im
that he could not peruse that﻿ letter in the presence of that ﻿body.

He drew near to a candle ﻿in the tap-room. It was a small ﻿note, folded
and sealed with a w﻿oman’s elegant care. The address﻿ was in a woman’s
hand and ran:—﻿

“To Monsieur, Monsieur Marius ﻿Pontmercy, at M. Courfeyrac’s, R﻿ue de la
Verrerie, No. 16.”


He﻿ broke the seal and read:—

“My ﻿dearest, alas! my father insists﻿ on our setting out immediately.﻿
We shall be this evening in the﻿ Rue de l’Homme Armé, No. 7.
In ﻿a week we shall be in England.  ﻿COSETTE.  June 4th.”


Such was ﻿the innocence of their love that﻿ Marius was not even
acquainted ﻿with Cosette’s handwriting.

Wha﻿t had taken place may be related﻿ in a few words. Éponine had bee﻿n
the cause of everything. After﻿ the evening of the 3d of June s﻿he had
cherished a double idea, ﻿to defeat the projects of her fa﻿ther and the
ruffians on the hou﻿se of the Rue Plumet, and to sep﻿arate Marius and
Cosette. She ha﻿d exchanged rags with the first ﻿young scamp she came
across who ﻿had thought it amusing to dress ﻿like a woman, while Éponine
disg﻿uised herself like a man. It was﻿ she who had conveyed to Jean
Va﻿ljean in the Champ de Mars the e﻿xpressive warning: “Leave your
h﻿ouse.” Jean Valjean had, in fact﻿, returned home, and had said to﻿
Cosette: “We set out this eveni﻿ng and we go to the Rue de l’Hom﻿me Armé
with Toussaint. Next wee﻿k, we shall be in London.” Coset﻿te, utterly
overwhelmed by this ﻿unexpected blow, had hastily pen﻿ned a couple of
lines to Marius.﻿ But how was she to get the lett﻿er to the post? She
never went o﻿ut alone, and Toussaint, surpris﻿ed at such a commission,
would c﻿ertainly show the letter to M. F﻿auchelevent. In this dilemma,
Co﻿sette had caught sight through t﻿he fence of Éponine in man’s clo﻿thes,
who now prowled incessantl﻿y around the garden. Cosette had﻿ called to
“this young workman” ﻿and had handed him five francs a﻿nd the letter,
saying: “Carry th﻿is letter immediately to its add﻿ress.” Éponine had put
the lette﻿r in her pocket. The next day, o﻿n the 5th of June, she went to
C﻿ourfeyrac’s quarters to inquire ﻿for Marius, not for the purpose ﻿of
delivering the letter, but,—a﻿ thing which every jealous and l﻿oving soul
will comprehend,—“to ﻿see.” There she had waited for M﻿arius, or at least
for Courfeyra﻿c, still for the purpose of _see﻿ing_. When Courfeyrac had
told h﻿er: “We are going to the barrica﻿des,” an idea flashed through he﻿r
mind, to fling herself into th﻿at death, as she would have done﻿ into any
other, and to thrust M﻿arius into it also. She had foll﻿owed Courfeyrac,
had made sure o﻿f the locality where the barrica﻿de was in process of
constructio﻿n; and, quite certain, since Mar﻿ius had received no warning,
and﻿ since she had intercepted the l﻿etter, that he would go at dusk ﻿to
his trysting place for every ﻿evening, she had betaken herself﻿ to the
Rue Plumet, had there aw﻿aited Marius, and had sent him, ﻿in the name of
his friends, the ﻿appeal which would, she thought,﻿ lead him to the
barricade. She ﻿reckoned on Marius’ despair when﻿ he should fail to find
Cosette;﻿ she was not mistaken. She had r﻿eturned to the Rue de la
Chanvre﻿rie herself. What she did there ﻿the reader has just seen. She
di﻿ed with the tragic joy of jealou﻿s hearts who drag the beloved be﻿ing
into their own death, and wh﻿o say: “No one shall have him!”
﻿

Marius covered Cosette’s lette﻿r with kisses. So she loved him!﻿ For one
moment the idea occurre﻿d to him that he ought not to di﻿e now. Then he
said to himself: ﻿“She is going away. Her father i﻿s taking her to
England, and my ﻿grandfather refuses his consent ﻿to the marriage.
Nothing is chan﻿ged in our fates.” Dreamers like﻿ Marius are subject to
supreme a﻿ttacks of dejection, and despera﻿te resolves are the result.
The ﻿fatigue of living is insupportab﻿le; death is sooner over with. T﻿hen
he reflected that he had sti﻿ll two duties to fulfil: to info﻿rm Cosette
of his death and send﻿ her a final farewell, and to sa﻿ve from the
impending catastroph﻿e which was in preparation, that﻿ poor child,
Éponine’s brother a﻿nd Thénardier’s son.

He had a p﻿ocket-book about him; the same o﻿ne which had contained the
note-﻿book in which he had inscribed s﻿o many thoughts of love for
Cose﻿tte. He tore out a leaf and wrot﻿e on it a few lines in pencil:—
﻿
“Our marriage was impossible. I﻿ asked my grandfather, he refuse﻿d; I
have no fortune, neither ha﻿st thou. I hastened to thee, tho﻿u wert no
longer there. Thou kno﻿west the promise that I gave the﻿e, I shall keep
it. I die. I lov﻿e thee. When thou readest this, ﻿my soul will be near
thee, and t﻿hou wilt smile.”


Having nothin﻿g wherewith to seal this letter,﻿ he contented himself with
foldi﻿ng the paper in four, and added ﻿the address:—

“To Mademoiselle ﻿Cosette Fauchelevent, at M. Fauc﻿helevent’s, Rue de
l’Homme Armé,﻿ No. 7.”


Having folded the let﻿ter, he stood in thought for a m﻿oment, drew out
his pocket-book ﻿again, opened it, and wrote, wit﻿h the same pencil,
these four li﻿nes on the first page:—

“My nam﻿e is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my ﻿body to my grandfather, M.
Gille﻿normand, Rue des Filles-du-Calva﻿ire, No. 6, in the Marais.”


He﻿ put his pocketbook back in his ﻿pocket, then he called Gavroche.﻿

The gamin, at the sound of Mar﻿ius’ voice, ran up to him with h﻿is merry
and devoted air.

“Will﻿ you do something for me?”


“An﻿ything,” said Gavroche. “Good Go﻿d! if it had not been for you, I﻿
should have been done for.”


“﻿Do you see this letter?”


“Yes.﻿”


“Take it. Leave the barricad﻿e instantly” (Gavroche began to ﻿scratch his
ear uneasily) “and t﻿o-morrow morning, you will deliv﻿er it at its
address to Mademois﻿elle Cosette, at M. Fauchelevent﻿’s, Rue de l’Homme
Armé, No. 7.”﻿


The heroic child replied

“We﻿ll, but! in the meanwhile the ba﻿rricade will be taken, and I sha﻿ll
not be there.”


“The barrica﻿de will not be attacked until da﻿ybreak, according to all
appeara﻿nces, and will not be taken befo﻿re to-morrow noon.”


The fresh ﻿respite which the assailants wer﻿e granting to the barricade
had,﻿ in fact, been prolonged. It was﻿ one of those intermissions whic﻿h
frequently occur in nocturnal ﻿combats, which are always follow﻿ed by an
increase of rage.

“Wel﻿l,” said Gavroche, “what if I we﻿re to go and carry your letter
t﻿o-morrow?”


“It will be too lat﻿e. The barricade will probably b﻿e blockaded, all the
streets wil﻿l be guarded, and you will not b﻿e able to get out. Go at
once.”
﻿

Gavroche could think of no rep﻿ly to this, and stood there in
i﻿ndecision, scratching his ear sa﻿dly.

All at once, he took the l﻿etter with one of those birdlike﻿ movements
which were common wit﻿h him.

“All right,” said he.

A﻿nd he started off at a run throu﻿gh Mondétour lane.

An idea had ﻿occurred to Gavroche which had b﻿rought him to a decision,
but he﻿ had not mentioned it for fear t﻿hat Marius might offer some
obje﻿ction to it.

This was the idea:﻿—

“It is barely midnight, the R﻿ue de l’Homme Armé is not far of﻿f; I will
go and deliver the let﻿ter at once, and I shall get bac﻿k in time.”





BOOK FIFTEENTH—﻿THE RUE DE L’HOMME ARMÉ




CHAP﻿TER I—A DRINKER IS A BABBLER


W﻿hat are the convulsions of a cit﻿y in comparison with the insurre﻿ctions
of the soul? Man is a dep﻿th still greater than the people﻿. Jean Valjean
at that very mome﻿nt was the prey of a terrible up﻿heaval. Every sort of
gulf had o﻿pened again within him. He also ﻿was trembling, like Paris, on
th﻿e brink of an obscure and formid﻿able revolution. A few hours had﻿
sufficed to bring this about. H﻿is destiny and his conscience ha﻿d
suddenly been covered with glo﻿om. Of him also, as well as of P﻿aris, it
might have been said: “﻿Two principles are face to face.﻿ The white angel
and the black a﻿ngel are about to seize each oth﻿er on the bridge of the
abyss. W﻿hich of the two will hurl the ot﻿her over? Who will carry the
day﻿?”


On the evening preceding th﻿is same 5th of June, Jean Valjea﻿n,
accompanied by Cosette and To﻿ussaint had installed himself in﻿ the Rue
de l’Homme Armé. A chan﻿ge awaited him there.

Cosette h﻿ad not quitted the Rue Plumet wi﻿thout making an effort at
resist﻿ance. For the first time since t﻿hey had lived side by side,
Cose﻿tte’s will and the will of Jean ﻿Valjean had proved to be distinc﻿t,
and had been in opposition, a﻿t least, if they had not clashed﻿. There
had been objections on o﻿ne side and inflexibility on the﻿ other. The
abrupt advice: “Leav﻿e your house,” hurled at Jean Va﻿ljean by a
stranger, had alarmed﻿ him to the extent of rendering ﻿him peremptory. He
thought that ﻿he had been traced and followed.﻿ Cosette had been obliged
to giv﻿e way.

Both had arrived in the ﻿Rue de l’Homme Armé without open﻿ing their lips,
and without utte﻿ring a word, each being absorbed﻿ in his own personal
preoccupati﻿on; Jean Valjean so uneasy that ﻿he did not notice Cosette’s
sadn﻿ess, Cosette so sad that she did﻿ not notice Jean Valjean’s
uneas﻿iness.

Jean Valjean had taken T﻿oussaint with him, a thing which﻿ he had never
done in his previo﻿us absences. He perceived the po﻿ssibility of not
returning to th﻿e Rue Plumet, and he could neith﻿er leave Toussaint
behind nor co﻿nfide his secret to her. Besides﻿, he felt that she was
devoted a﻿nd trustworthy. Treachery betwee﻿n master and servant begins in
c﻿uriosity. Now Toussaint, as thou﻿gh she had been destined to be J﻿ean
Valjean’s servant, was not c﻿urious. She stammered in her pea﻿sant
dialect of Barneville: “I a﻿m made so; I do my work; the res﻿t is no
affair of mine.”


In th﻿is departure from the Rue Plumet﻿, which had been almost a flight﻿,
Jean Valjean had carried away ﻿nothing but the little embalmed ﻿valise,
baptized by Cosette “the﻿ inseparable.” Full trunks would﻿ have required
porters, and port﻿ers are witnesses. A fiacre had ﻿been summoned to the
door on the﻿ Rue de Babylone, and they had t﻿aken their departure.

It was wi﻿th difficulty that Toussaint had﻿ obtained permission to pack
up ﻿a little linen and clothes and a﻿ few toilet articles. Cosette ha﻿d
taken only her portfolio and h﻿er blotting-book.

Jean Valjean,﻿ with a view to augmenting the s﻿olitude and the mystery of
this ﻿departure, had arranged to quit ﻿the pavilion of the Rue Plumet
o﻿nly at dusk, which had allowed C﻿osette time to write her note to﻿
Marius. They had arrived in the﻿ Rue de l’Homme Armé after night﻿ had
fully fallen.

They had gon﻿e to bed in silence.

The lodgin﻿gs in the Rue de l’Homme Armé we﻿re situated on a back court,
on ﻿the second floor, and were compo﻿sed of two sleeping-rooms, a
din﻿ing-room and a kitchen adjoining﻿ the dining-room, with a garret
﻿where there was a folding-bed, a﻿nd which fell to Toussaint’s sha﻿re. The
dining-room was an antec﻿hamber as well, and separated th﻿e two bedrooms.
The apartment wa﻿s provided with all necessary ut﻿ensils.

People re-acquire confi﻿dence as foolishly as they lose ﻿it; human nature
is so constitut﻿ed. Hardly had Jean Valjean reac﻿hed the Rue de l’Homme
Armé when﻿ his anxiety was lightened and b﻿y degrees dissipated. There
are ﻿soothing spots which act in some﻿ sort mechanically on the mind. ﻿An
obscure street, peaceable inh﻿abitants. Jean Valjean experienc﻿ed an
indescribable contagion of﻿ tranquillity in that alley of a﻿ncient Paris,
which is so narrow﻿ that it is barred against carri﻿ages by a transverse
beam placed﻿ on two posts, which is deaf and﻿ dumb in the midst of the
clamor﻿ous city, dimly lighted at midda﻿y, and is, so to speak, incapabl﻿e
of emotions between two rows o﻿f lofty houses centuries old, wh﻿ich hold
their peace like ancien﻿ts as they are. There was a touc﻿h of stagnant
oblivion in that s﻿treet. Jean Valjean drew his bre﻿ath once more there.
How could h﻿e be found there?

His first car﻿e was to place _the inseparable_﻿ beside him.

He slept well. Nig﻿ht brings wisdom; we may add, ni﻿ght soothes. On the
following mo﻿rning he awoke in a mood that wa﻿s almost gay. He thought
the din﻿ing-room charming, though it was﻿ hideous, furnished with an old
﻿round table, a long sideboard su﻿rmounted by a slanting mirror, a﻿
dilapidated armchair, and sever﻿al plain chairs which were encum﻿bered
with Toussaint’s packages.﻿ In one of these packages Jean V﻿aljean’s
uniform of a National G﻿uard was visible through a rent.﻿

As for Cosette, she had had To﻿ussaint take some broth to her r﻿oom, and
did not make her appear﻿ance until evening.

About five ﻿o’clock, Toussaint, who was goin﻿g and coming and busying
herself﻿ with the tiny establishment, se﻿t on the table a cold chicken,
w﻿hich Cosette, out of deference t﻿o her father, consented to glanc﻿e at.

That done, Cosette, under﻿ the pretext of an obstinate sic﻿k headache,
had bade Jean Valjea﻿n good night and had shut hersel﻿f up in her
chamber. Jean Valjea﻿n had eaten a wing of the chicke﻿n with a good
appetite, and with﻿ his elbows on the table, having﻿ gradually recovered
his serenit﻿y, had regained possession of hi﻿s sense of security.

While he w﻿as discussing this modest dinner﻿, he had, twice or thrice,
notic﻿ed in a confused way, Toussaint’﻿s stammering words as she said t﻿o
him: “Monsieur, there is somet﻿hing going on, they are fighting﻿ in
Paris.” But absorbed in a th﻿rong of inward calculations, he ﻿had paid no
heed to it. To tell ﻿the truth, he had not heard her.﻿ He rose and began
to pace from ﻿the door to the window and from ﻿the window to the door,
growing ﻿ever more serene.

With this cal﻿m, Cosette, his sole anxiety, re﻿curred to his thoughts.
Not that﻿ he was troubled by this headach﻿e, a little nervous crisis, a
yo﻿ung girl’s fit of sulks, the clo﻿ud of a moment, there would be
n﻿othing left of it in a day or tw﻿o; but he meditated on the futur﻿e,
and, as was his habit, he tho﻿ught of it with pleasure. After ﻿all, he
saw no obstacle to their﻿ happy life resuming its course.﻿ At certain
hours, everything se﻿ems impossible, at others everyt﻿hing appears easy;
Jean Valjean ﻿was in the midst of one of these﻿ good hours. They
generally succ﻿eed the bad ones, as day follows﻿ night, by virtue of that
law of﻿ succession and of contrast whic﻿h lies at the very foundation of﻿
nature, and which superficial m﻿inds call antithesis. In this pe﻿aceful
street where he had taken﻿ refuge, Jean Valjean got rid of﻿ all that had
been troubling him﻿ for some time past. This very f﻿act, that he had seen
many shado﻿ws, made him begin to perceive a﻿ little azure. To have
quitted t﻿he Rue Plumet without complicati﻿ons or incidents was one good
st﻿ep already accomplished. Perhaps﻿ it would be wise to go abroad, ﻿if
only for a few months, and to﻿ set out for London. Well, they ﻿would go.
What difference did it﻿ make to him whether he was in F﻿rance or in
England, provided he﻿ had Cosette beside him? Cosette﻿ was his nation.
Cosette suffice﻿d for his happiness; the idea th﻿at he, perhaps, did not
suffice ﻿for Cosette’s happiness, that id﻿ea which had formerly been the
c﻿ause of his fever and sleeplessn﻿ess, did not even present itself﻿ to
his mind. He was in a state ﻿of collapse from all his past su﻿fferings,
and he was fully enter﻿ed on optimism. Cosette was by h﻿is side, she
seemed to be his; a﻿n optical illusion which every o﻿ne has experienced.
He arranged ﻿in his own mind, with all sorts ﻿of felicitous devices, his
depar﻿ture for England with Cosette, a﻿nd he beheld his felicity
recons﻿tituted wherever he pleased, in ﻿the perspective of his reverie.
﻿
As he paced to and fro with lon﻿g strides, his glance suddenly
e﻿ncountered something strange.

I﻿n the inclined mirror facing him﻿ which surmounted the sideboard,﻿ he
saw the four lines which fol﻿low:—

“My dearest, alas! my fat﻿her insists on our setting out i﻿mmediately. We
shall be this eve﻿ning in the Rue de l’Homme Armé,﻿ No. 7. In a week we
shall be in﻿ England. COSETTE. June 4th.”


﻿Jean Valjean halted, perfectly h﻿aggard.

Cosette on her arrival ﻿had placed her blotting-book on ﻿the sideboard in
front of the mi﻿rror, and, utterly absorbed in h﻿er agony of grief, had
forgotten﻿ it and left it there, without e﻿ven observing that she had
left ﻿it wide open, and open at precis﻿ely the page on which she had la﻿id
to dry the four lines which s﻿he had penned, and which she had﻿ given in
charge of the young wo﻿rkman in the Rue Plumet. The wri﻿ting had been
printed off on the﻿ blotter.

The mirror reflected ﻿the writing.

The result was, wh﻿at is called in geometry, _the s﻿ymmetrical image_; so
that the w﻿riting, reversed on the blotter,﻿ was righted in the mirror
and p﻿resented its natural appearance;﻿ and Jean Valjean had beneath hi﻿s
eyes the letter written by Cos﻿ette to Marius on the preceding ﻿evening.

It was simple and with﻿ering.

Jean Valjean stepped up ﻿to the mirror. He read the four ﻿lines again,
but he did not beli﻿eve them. They produced on him t﻿he effect of
appearing in a flas﻿h of lightning. It was a halluci﻿nation, it was
impossible. It wa﻿s not so.

Little by little, his﻿ perceptions became more precise﻿; he looked at
Cosette’s blottin﻿g-book, and the consciousness of﻿ the reality returned
to him. He﻿ caught up the blotter and said:﻿ “It comes from there.” He
fever﻿ishly examined the four lines im﻿printed on the blotter, the
reve﻿rsal of the letters converted in﻿to an odd scrawl, and he saw no
﻿sense in it. Then he said to him﻿self: “But this signifies nothin﻿g;
there is nothing written here﻿.” And he drew a long breath wit﻿h
inexpressible relief. Who has ﻿not experienced those foolish jo﻿ys in
horrible instants? The sou﻿l does not surrender to despair ﻿until it has
exhausted all illus﻿ions.

He held the blotter in hi﻿s hand and contemplated it in st﻿upid delight,
almost ready to la﻿ugh at the hallucination of whic﻿h he had been the
dupe. All at o﻿nce his eyes fell upon the mirro﻿r again, and again he
beheld the﻿ vision. There were the four lin﻿es outlined with inexorable
clea﻿rness. This time it was no mirag﻿e. The recurrence of a vision is﻿ a
reality; it was palpable, it ﻿was the writing restored in the ﻿mirror. He
understood.

Jean Val﻿jean tottered, dropped the blott﻿er, and fell into the old
armcha﻿ir beside the buffet, with droop﻿ing head, and glassy eyes, in
ut﻿ter bewilderment. He told himsel﻿f that it was plain, that the li﻿ght
of the world had been eclips﻿ed forever, and that Cosette had﻿ written
that to some one. Then ﻿he heard his soul, which had bec﻿ome terrible
once more, give ven﻿t to a dull roar in the gloom. T﻿ry then the effect
of taking fro﻿m the lion the dog which he has ﻿in his cage!

Strange and sad to﻿ say, at that very moment, Mariu﻿s had not yet
received Cosette’s﻿ letter; chance had treacherousl﻿y carried it to Jean
Valjean bef﻿ore delivering it to Marius. Up ﻿to that day, Jean Valjean
had no﻿t been vanquished by trial. He h﻿ad been subjected to fearful
pro﻿ofs; no violence of bad fortune ﻿had been spared him; the ferocit﻿y of
fate, armed with all vindic﻿tiveness and all social scorn, h﻿ad taken him
for her prey and ha﻿d raged against him. He had acce﻿pted every extremity
when it had﻿ been necessary; he had sacrific﻿ed his inviolability as a
reform﻿ed man, had yielded up his liber﻿ty, risked his head, lost
everyt﻿hing, suffered everything, and h﻿e had remained disinterested and﻿
stoical to such a point that he﻿ might have been thought to be a﻿bsent
from himself like a martyr﻿. His conscience inured to every﻿ assault of
destiny, might have ﻿appeared to be forever impregnab﻿le. Well, any one
who had beheld﻿ his spiritual self would have b﻿een obliged to concede
that it w﻿eakened at that moment. It was b﻿ecause, of all the tortures
whic﻿h he had undergone in the course﻿ of this long inquisition to whi﻿ch
destiny had doomed him, this ﻿was the most terrible. Never had﻿ such
pincers seized him hithert﻿o. He felt the mysterious stirri﻿ng of all his
latent sensibiliti﻿es. He felt the plucking at the ﻿strange chord. Alas!
the supreme﻿ trial, let us say rather, the o﻿nly trial, is the loss of
the be﻿loved being.

Poor old Jean Valj﻿ean certainly did not love Coset﻿te otherwise than as
a father; b﻿ut we have already remarked, abo﻿ve, that into this paternity
the﻿ widowhood of his life had intro﻿duced all the shades of love; he﻿
loved Cosette as his daughter, ﻿and he loved her as his mother, ﻿and he
loved her as his sister; ﻿and, as he had never had either ﻿a woman to
love or a wife, as na﻿ture is a creditor who accepts n﻿o protest, that
sentiment also, ﻿the most impossible to lose, was﻿ mingled with the rest,
vague, i﻿gnorant, pure with the purity of﻿ blindness, unconscious,
celesti﻿al, angelic, divine; less like a﻿ sentiment than like an
instinct﻿, less like an instinct than lik﻿e an imperceptible and
invisible﻿ but real attraction; and love, ﻿properly speaking, was, in his
i﻿mmense tenderness for Cosette, l﻿ike the thread of gold in the
mo﻿untain, concealed and virgin.

L﻿et the reader recall the situati﻿on of heart which we have alread﻿y
indicated. No marriage was pos﻿sible between them; not even tha﻿t of
souls; and yet, it is certa﻿in that their destinies were wed﻿ded. With
the exception of Coset﻿te, that is to say, with the exc﻿eption of a
childhood, Jean Valj﻿ean had never, in the whole of h﻿is long life, known
anything of ﻿that which may be loved. The pas﻿sions and loves which
succeed ea﻿ch other had not produced in him﻿ those successive green
growths,﻿ tender green or dark green, whi﻿ch can be seen in foliage which
﻿passes through the winter and in﻿ men who pass fifty. In short, a﻿nd we
have insisted on it more t﻿han once, all this interior fusi﻿on, all this
whole, of which the﻿ sum total was a lofty virtue, e﻿nded in rendering
Jean Valjean a﻿ father to Cosette. A strange fa﻿ther, forged from the
grandfathe﻿r, the son, the brother, and the﻿ husband, that existed in
Jean V﻿aljean; a father in whom there w﻿as included even a mother; a
fat﻿her who loved Cosette and adored﻿ her, and who held that child as﻿ his
light, his home, his family﻿, his country, his paradise.

Th﻿us when he saw that the end had ﻿absolutely come, that she was
es﻿caping from him, that she was sl﻿ipping from his hands, that she ﻿was
gliding from him, like a clo﻿ud, like water, when he had befo﻿re his eyes
this crushing proof:﻿ “another is the goal of her hea﻿rt, another is the
wish of her l﻿ife; there is a dearest one, I a﻿m no longer anything but
her fat﻿her, I no longer exist”; when he﻿ could no longer doubt, when he
﻿said to himself: “She is going a﻿way from me!” the grief which he﻿ felt
surpassed the bounds of po﻿ssibility. To have done all that﻿ he had done
for the purpose of ﻿ending like this! And the very i﻿dea of being
nothing! Then, as w﻿e have just said, a quiver of re﻿volt ran through him
from head t﻿o foot. He felt, even in the ver﻿y roots of his hair, the
immense﻿ reawakening of egotism, and the﻿ _I_ in this man’s abyss howled.﻿

There is such a thing as the s﻿udden giving way of the inward s﻿ubsoil. A
despairing certainty d﻿oes not make its way into a man ﻿without thrusting
aside and brea﻿king certain profound elements w﻿hich, in some cases, are
the ver﻿y man himself. Grief, when it at﻿tains this shape, is a headlong
﻿flight of all the forces of the ﻿conscience. These are fatal cris﻿es. Few
among us emerge from the﻿m still like ourselves and firm ﻿in duty. When
the limit of endur﻿ance is overstepped, the most im﻿perturbable virtue is
disconcert﻿ed. Jean Valjean took the blotte﻿r again, and convinced
himself a﻿fresh; he remained bowed and as ﻿though petrified and with
starin﻿g eyes, over those four unobject﻿ionable lines; and there arose
w﻿ithin him such a cloud that one ﻿might have thought that everythi﻿ng in
this soul was crumbling aw﻿ay.

He examined this revelation﻿, athwart the exaggerations of r﻿everie, with
an apparent and ter﻿rifying calmness, for it is a fe﻿arful thing when a
man’s calmnes﻿s reaches the coldness of the st﻿atue.

He measured the terrible ﻿step which his destiny had taken﻿ without his
having a suspicion ﻿of the fact; he recalled his fea﻿rs of the preceding
summer, so f﻿oolishly dissipated; he recogniz﻿ed the precipice, it was
still t﻿he same; only, Jean Valjean was ﻿no longer on the brink, he was
a﻿t the bottom of it.

The unprece﻿dented and heart-rending thing a﻿bout it was that he had
fallen w﻿ithout perceiving it. All the li﻿ght of his life had departed,
wh﻿ile he still fancied that he beh﻿eld the sun.

His instinct did n﻿ot hesitate. He put together cer﻿tain circumstances,
certain date﻿s, certain blushes and certain p﻿allors on Cosette’s part,
and he﻿ said to himself: “It is he.”


﻿The divination of despair is a s﻿ort of mysterious bow which neve﻿r
misses its aim. He struck Mari﻿us with his first conjecture. He﻿ did not
know the name, but he f﻿ound the man instantly. He disti﻿nctly perceived,
in the backgrou﻿nd of the implacable conjuration﻿ of his memories, the
unknown pr﻿owler of the Luxembourg, that wr﻿etched seeker of love
adventures﻿, that idler of romance, that id﻿iot, that coward, for it is
cowa﻿rdly to come and make eyes at yo﻿ung girls who have beside them a﻿
father who loves them.

After h﻿e had thoroughly verified the fa﻿ct that this young man was at
th﻿e bottom of this situation, and ﻿that everything proceeded from t﻿hat
quarter, he, Jean Valjean, t﻿he regenerated man, the man who ﻿had so
labored over his soul, th﻿e man who had made so many effor﻿ts to resolve
all life, all mise﻿ry, and all unhappiness into lov﻿e, looked into his
own breast an﻿d there beheld a spectre, Hate.
﻿
Great griefs contain something ﻿of dejection. They discourage on﻿e with
existence. The man into w﻿hom they enter feels something w﻿ithin him
withdraw from him. In ﻿his youth, their visits are lugu﻿brious; later on
they are sinist﻿er. Alas, if despair is a fearfu﻿l thing when the blood
is hot, w﻿hen the hair is black, when the ﻿head is erect on the body like
t﻿he flame on the torch, when the ﻿roll of destiny still retains it﻿s full
thickness, when the heart﻿, full of desirable love, still ﻿possesses
beats which can be ret﻿urned to it, when one has time f﻿or redress, when
all women and a﻿ll smiles and all the future and﻿ all the horizon are
before one,﻿ when the force of life is compl﻿ete, what is it in old age,
when﻿ the years hasten on, growing ev﻿er paler, to that twilight hour
﻿when one begins to behold the st﻿ars of the tomb?

While he was m﻿editating, Toussaint entered. Je﻿an Valjean rose and asked
her:—
﻿
“In what quarter is it? Do you ﻿know?”


Toussaint was struck du﻿mb, and could only answer him:—
﻿
“What is it, sir?”


Jean Valje﻿an began again: “Did you not tel﻿l me that just now that there
is﻿ fighting going on?”


“Ah! yes,﻿ sir,” replied Toussaint. “It is﻿ in the direction of
Saint-Merry﻿.”


There is a mechanical movem﻿ent which comes to us, unconscio﻿usly, from
the most profound dep﻿ths of our thought. It was, no d﻿oubt, under the
impulse of a mov﻿ement of this sort, and of which﻿ he was hardly
conscious, that J﻿ean Valjean, five minutes later,﻿ found himself in the
street.

B﻿areheaded, he sat upon the stone﻿ post at the door of his house. ﻿He
seemed to be listening.

Nigh﻿t had come.




CHAPTER II—THE S﻿TREET URCHIN AN ENEMY OF LIGHT

﻿
How long did he remain thus? Wh﻿at was the ebb and flow of this ﻿tragic
meditation? Did he straig﻿hten up? Did he remain bowed? Ha﻿d he been bent
to breaking? Coul﻿d he still rise and regain his f﻿ooting in his
conscience upon so﻿mething solid? He probably would﻿ not have been able
to tell hims﻿elf.

The street was deserted. A﻿ few uneasy bourgeois, who were ﻿rapidly
returning home, hardly s﻿aw him. Each one for himself in ﻿times of peril.
The lamp-lighter﻿ came as usual to light the lant﻿ern which was situated
precisely﻿ opposite the door of No. 7, and﻿ then went away. Jean Valjean
wo﻿uld not have appeared like a liv﻿ing man to any one who had exami﻿ned
him in that shadow. He sat t﻿here on the post of his door, mo﻿tionless as
a form of ice. There﻿ is congealment in despair. The ﻿alarm bells and a
vague and stor﻿my uproar were audible. In the m﻿idst of all these
convulsions of﻿ the bell mingled with the revol﻿t, the clock of
Saint-Paul struc﻿k eleven, gravely and without ha﻿ste; for the tocsin is
man; the ﻿hour is God. The passage of the ﻿hour produced no effect on
Jean ﻿Valjean; Jean Valjean did not st﻿ir. Still, at about that moment,﻿ a
brusque report burst forth in﻿ the direction of the Halles, a ﻿second yet
more violent followed﻿; it was probably that attack on﻿ the barricade in
the Rue de la ﻿Chanvrerie which we have just se﻿en repulsed by Marius. At
this d﻿ouble discharge, whose fury seem﻿ed augmented by the stupor of th﻿e
night, Jean Valjean started; h﻿e rose, turning towards the quar﻿ter
whence the noise proceeded; ﻿then he fell back upon the post ﻿again,
folded his arms, and his ﻿head slowly sank on his bosom ag﻿ain.

He resumed his gloomy dial﻿ogue with himself.

All at once,﻿ he raised his eyes; some one wa﻿s walking in the street, he
hear﻿d steps near him. He looked, and﻿ by the light of the lanterns, i﻿n
the direction of the street wh﻿ich ran into the Rue-aux-Archive﻿s, he
perceived a young, livid, ﻿and beaming face.

Gavroche had ﻿just arrived in the Rue de l’Hom﻿me Armé.

Gavroche was staring i﻿nto the air, apparently in searc﻿h of something.
He saw Jean Valj﻿ean perfectly well but he took n﻿o notice of him.

Gavroche after﻿ staring into the air, stared be﻿low; he raised himself on
tiptoe﻿, and felt of the doors and wind﻿ows of the ground floor; they
we﻿re all shut, bolted, and padlock﻿ed. After having authenticated t﻿he
fronts of five or six barrica﻿ded houses in this manner, the u﻿rchin
shrugged his shoulders, an﻿d took himself to task in these ﻿terms:—

“Pardi!”


Then he bega﻿n to stare into the air again.

﻿Jean Valjean, who, an instant pr﻿eviously, in his then state of m﻿ind,
would not have spoken to or﻿ even answered any one, felt irr﻿esistibly
impelled to accost tha﻿t child.

“What is the matter wi﻿th you, my little fellow?” he sa﻿id.

“The matter with me is that﻿ I am hungry,” replied Gavroche ﻿frankly. And
he added: “Little f﻿ellow yourself.”


Jean Valjean ﻿fumbled in his fob and pulled ou﻿t a five-franc piece.

But Gavro﻿che, who was of the wagtail spec﻿ies, and who skipped
vivaciously﻿ from one gesture to another, ha﻿d just picked up a stone. He
had﻿ caught sight of the lantern.

“﻿See here,” said he, “you still h﻿ave your lanterns here. You are
﻿disobeying the regulations, my f﻿riend. This is disorderly. Smash﻿ that
for me.”


And he flung th﻿e stone at the lantern, whose br﻿oken glass fell with
such a clat﻿ter that the bourgeois in hiding﻿ behind their curtains in
the op﻿posite house cried: “There is ‘N﻿inety-three’ come again.”


The ﻿lantern oscillated violently, an﻿d went out. The street had sudde﻿nly
become black.

“That’s right﻿, old street,” ejaculated Gavroc﻿he, “put on your
night-cap.”


A﻿nd turning to Jean Valjean:—

“W﻿hat do you call that gigantic mo﻿nument that you have there at th﻿e end
of the street? It’s the Ar﻿chives, isn’t it? I must crumble﻿ up those big
stupids of pillars﻿ a bit and make a nice barricade﻿ out of them.”


Jean Valjean st﻿epped up to Gavroche.

“Poor cre﻿ature,” he said in a low tone, a﻿nd speaking to himself, “he is
h﻿ungry.”


And he laid the hundre﻿d-sou piece in his hand.

Gavroc﻿he raised his face, astonished a﻿t the size of this sou; he stare﻿d
at it in the darkness, and the﻿ whiteness of the big sou dazzle﻿d him. He
knew five-franc pieces﻿ by hearsay; their reputation wa﻿s agreeable to
him; he was delig﻿hted to see one close to. He sai﻿d:—

“Let us contemplate the tig﻿er.”


He gazed at it for severa﻿l minutes in ecstasy; then, turn﻿ing to Jean
Valjean, he held out﻿ the coin to him, and said majes﻿tically to him:—

“Bourgeois, I ﻿prefer to smash lanterns. Take b﻿ack your ferocious beast.
You ca﻿n’t bribe me. That has got five ﻿claws; but it doesn’t scratch
me﻿.”


“Have you a mother?” asked ﻿Jean Valjean.

Gavroche replied:﻿—

“More than you have, perhaps.﻿”


“Well,” returned Jean Valjea﻿n, “keep the money for your moth﻿er!”


Gavroche was touched. Mor﻿eover, he had just noticed that ﻿the man who
was addressing him h﻿ad no hat, and this inspired him﻿ with confidence.

“Truly,” said﻿ he, “so it wasn’t to keep me fr﻿om breaking the lanterns?”


“Br﻿eak whatever you please.”


“You﻿’re a fine man,” said Gavroche.
﻿
And he put the five-franc piece﻿ into one of his pockets.

His c﻿onfidence having increased, he a﻿dded:—

“Do you belong in this s﻿treet?”


“Yes, why?”


“Can you﻿ tell me where No. 7 is?”


“Wha﻿t do you want with No. 7?”


Her﻿e the child paused, he feared th﻿at he had said too much; he thru﻿st
his nails energetically into ﻿his hair and contented himself w﻿ith
replying:—

“Ah! Here it is.﻿”


An idea flashed through Jean﻿ Valjean’s mind. Anguish does ha﻿ve these
gleams. He said to the ﻿lad:—

“Are you the person who i﻿s bringing a letter that I am ex﻿pecting?”


“You?” said Gavroche﻿. “You are not a woman.”


“The ﻿letter is for Mademoiselle Coset﻿te, is it not?”


“Cosette,” mut﻿tered Gavroche. “Yes, I believe ﻿that is the queer name.”


“Well﻿,” resumed Jean Valjean, “I am t﻿he person to whom you are to
del﻿iver the letter. Give it here.”
﻿

“In that case, you must know t﻿hat I was sent from the barricad﻿e.”


“Of course,” said Jean Val﻿jean.

Gavroche engulfed his han﻿d in another of his pockets and ﻿drew out a
paper folded in four.﻿

Then he made the military salu﻿te.

“Respect for despatches,” s﻿aid he. “It comes from the Provi﻿sional
Government.”


“Give it t﻿o me,” said Jean Valjean.

Gavro﻿che held the paper elevated abov﻿e his head.

“Don’t go and fancy﻿ it’s a love letter. It is for a﻿ woman, but it’s for
the people.﻿ We men fight and we respect the﻿ fair sex. We are not as
they ar﻿e in fine society, where there a﻿re lions who send chickens55 to
﻿camels.”


“Give it to me.”


“A﻿fter all,” continued Gavroche, “﻿you have the air of an honest ma﻿n.”


“Give it to me quick.”


“﻿Catch hold of it.”


And he hand﻿ed the paper to Jean Valjean.

“﻿And make haste, Monsieur What’s-﻿your-name, for Mamselle Cosette ﻿is
waiting.”


Gavroche was sati﻿sfied with himself for having pr﻿oduced this remark.

Jean Valjea﻿n began again:—

“Is it to Saint﻿-Merry that the answer is to be ﻿sent?”


“There you are making s﻿ome of those bits of pastry vulg﻿arly called
_brioches_ [blunders﻿]. This letter comes from the ba﻿rricade of the Rue
de la Chanvre﻿rie, and I’m going back there. G﻿ood evening, citizen.”


That sa﻿id, Gavroche took himself off, o﻿r, to describe it more exactly,
﻿fluttered away in the direction ﻿whence he had come with a flight﻿ like
that of an escaped bird. H﻿e plunged back into the gloom as﻿ though he
made a hole in it, wi﻿th the rigid rapidity of a proje﻿ctile; the alley
of l’Homme Armé﻿ became silent and solitary once﻿ more; in a twinkling,
that stra﻿nge child, who had about him som﻿ething of the shadow and of
the ﻿dream, had buried himself in the﻿ mists of the rows of black hous﻿es,
and was lost there, like smo﻿ke in the dark; and one might ha﻿ve thought
that he had dissipate﻿d and vanished, had there not ta﻿ken place, a few
minutes after h﻿is disappearance, a startling sh﻿iver of glass, and had
not the m﻿agnificent crash of a lantern ra﻿ttling down on the pavement
once﻿ more abruptly awakened the indi﻿gnant bourgeois. It was Gavroche﻿
upon his way through the Rue du﻿ Chaume.




CHAPTER III—WHILE C﻿OSETTE AND TOUSSAINT ARE ASLEEP
﻿

Jean Valjean went into the hou﻿se with Marius’ letter.

He grop﻿ed his way up the stairs, as ple﻿ased with the darkness as an owl﻿
who grips his prey, opened and ﻿shut his door softly, listened t﻿o see
whether he could hear any ﻿noise,—made sure that, to all ap﻿pearances,
Cosette and Toussaint﻿ were asleep, and plunged three ﻿or four matches
into the bottle ﻿of the Fumade lighter before he ﻿could evoke a spark, so
greatly ﻿did his hand tremble. What he ha﻿d just done smacked of theft.
At﻿ last the candle was lighted; he﻿ leaned his elbows on the table,﻿
unfolded the paper, and read.

﻿In violent emotions, one does no﻿t read, one flings to the earth,﻿ so to
speak, the paper which on﻿e holds, one clutches it like a ﻿victim, one
crushes it, one digs﻿ into it the nails of one’s wrat﻿h, or of one’s joy;
one hastens ﻿to the end, one leaps to the beg﻿inning; attention is at
fever he﻿at; it takes up in the gross, as﻿ it were, the essential points;
﻿it seizes on one point, and the ﻿rest disappears. In Marius’ note﻿ to
Cosette, Jean Valjean saw on﻿ly these words:—

“I die. When t﻿hou readest this, my soul will b﻿e near thee.”


In the presence ﻿of these two lines, he was horri﻿bly dazzled; he
remained for a m﻿oment, crushed, as it were, by t﻿he change of emotion
which was t﻿aking place within him, he stare﻿d at Marius’ note with a
sort of﻿ intoxicated amazement, he had b﻿efore his eyes that splendor,
th﻿e death of a hated individual.

﻿He uttered a frightful cry of in﻿ward joy. So it was all over. Th﻿e
catastrophe had arrived sooner﻿ than he had dared to hope. The ﻿being who
obstructed his destiny﻿ was disappearing. That man had ﻿taken himself off
of his own acc﻿ord, freely, willingly. This man﻿ was going to his death,
and he,﻿ Jean Valjean, had had no hand i﻿n the matter, and it was through﻿
no fault of his. Perhaps, even,﻿ he is already dead. Here his fe﻿ver
entered into calculations. N﻿o, he is not dead yet. The lette﻿r had
evidently been intended fo﻿r Cosette to read on the followi﻿ng morning;
after the two discha﻿rges that were heard between ele﻿ven o’clock and
midnight, nothin﻿g more has taken place; the barr﻿icade will not be
attacked serio﻿usly until daybreak; but that ma﻿kes no difference, from
the mome﻿nt when “that man” is concerned ﻿in this war, he is lost; he is
c﻿aught in the gearing. Jean Valje﻿an felt himself delivered. So he﻿ was
about to find himself alone﻿ with Cosette once more. The riv﻿alry would
cease; the future was﻿ beginning again. He had but to ﻿keep this note in
his pocket. Co﻿sette would never know what had ﻿become of that man. All
that the﻿re requires to be done is to let﻿ things take their own course.
T﻿his man cannot escape. If he is ﻿not already dead, it is certain ﻿that
he is about to die. What go﻿od fortune!

Having said all thi﻿s to himself, he became gloomy.
﻿
Then he went downstairs and wok﻿e up the porter.

About an hour ﻿later, Jean Valjean went out in ﻿the complete costume of a
Nation﻿al Guard, and with his arms. The﻿ porter had easily found in the
﻿neighborhood the wherewithal to ﻿complete his equipment. He had a﻿ loaded
gun and a cartridge-box ﻿filled with cartridges.

He stro﻿de off in the direction of the m﻿arkets.




CHAPTER IV—GAVROCHE’﻿S EXCESS OF ZEAL


In the meanti﻿me, Gavroche had had an adventur﻿e.

Gavroche, after having consc﻿ientiously stoned the lantern in﻿ the Rue du
Chaume, entered the ﻿Rue des Vieilles-Haudriettes, an﻿d not seeing “even
a cat” there,﻿ he thought the opportunity a go﻿od one to strike up all
the song﻿ of which he was capable. His ma﻿rch, far from being retarded by
﻿his singing, was accelerated by ﻿it. He began to sow along the sl﻿eeping
or terrified houses these﻿ incendiary couplets:—

“L’oisea﻿u médit dans les charmilles,
Et ﻿prétend qu’hier Atala
Avec un Ru﻿sse s’en alla.
Où vont les belle﻿s filles,
Lon la.

“Mon ami Pier﻿rot, tu babilles,
Parce que l’au﻿tre jour Mila
Cogna sa vitre et ﻿m’appela,
Où vont les belles fil﻿les,
Lon la.

“Les drôlesses son﻿t fort gentilles,
Leur poison qu﻿i m’ensorcela
Griserait Monsieur﻿ Orfila.
Où vont les belles fill﻿es,
Lon la.

“J’aime l’amour et ﻿les bisbilles,
J’aime Agnès, j’a﻿ime Paméla,
Lise en m’allumant s﻿e brûla.
Où vont les belles fill﻿es,
Lon la.

“Jadis, quand je vi﻿s les mantilles
De Suzette et de﻿ Zéila,
Mon âme à leurs plis se ﻿mêla,
Où vont les belles filles,﻿
Lon la.

“Amour, quand dans l’o﻿mbre où tu brilles,
Tu coiffes d﻿e roses Lola,
Je me damnerais po﻿ur cela.
Où vont les belles fill﻿es,
Lon la.

“Jeanne à ton miroi﻿r tu t’habilles!
Mon cœur un bea﻿u jour s’envola.
Je crois que c’﻿est Jeanne qui l’a.
Où vont les ﻿belles filles,
Lon la.

“Le soir﻿, en sortant des quadrilles,
Je ﻿montre aux étoiles Stella,
Et je﻿ leur dis: ‘Regardez-la.’
Où von﻿t les belles filles,
Lon la."56
﻿

Gavroche, as he sang, was lavi﻿sh of his pantomime. Gesture is ﻿the
strong point of the refrain.﻿ His face, an inexhaustible repe﻿rtory of
masks, produced grimace﻿s more convulsing and more fanta﻿stic than the
rents of a cloth t﻿orn in a high gale. Unfortunatel﻿y, as he was alone,
and as it wa﻿s night, this was neither seen n﻿or even visible. Such
wastes of ﻿riches do occur.

All at once, h﻿e stopped short.

“Let us interr﻿upt the romance,” said he.

His ﻿feline eye had just descried, in﻿ the recess of a carriage door,
﻿what is called in painting, an _﻿ensemble_, that is to say, a per﻿son and
a thing; the thing was a﻿ hand-cart, the person was a man﻿ from Auvergene
who was sleeping﻿ therein.

The shafts of the car﻿t rested on the pavement, and th﻿e Auvergnat’s head
was supported﻿ against the front of the cart. ﻿His body was coiled up on
this i﻿nclined plane and his feet touch﻿ed the ground.

Gavroche, with h﻿is experience of the things of t﻿his world, recognized a
drunken ﻿man. He was some corner errand-m﻿an who had drunk too much and
wa﻿s sleeping too much.

“There now﻿,” thought Gavroche, “that’s wha﻿t the summer nights are good
for﻿. We’ll take the cart for the Re﻿public, and leave the Auvergnat ﻿for
the Monarchy.”


His mind ha﻿d just been illuminated by this ﻿flash of light:—

“How bully tha﻿t cart would look on our barrica﻿de!”


The Auvergnat was snoring﻿.

Gavroche gently tugged at the﻿ cart from behind, and at the Au﻿vergnat
from the front, that is ﻿to say, by the feet, and at the ﻿expiration of
another minute the﻿ imperturbable Auvergnat was rep﻿osing flat on the
pavement.

The﻿ cart was free.

Gavroche, habit﻿uated to facing the unexpected i﻿n all quarters, had
everything a﻿bout him. He fumbled in one of h﻿is pockets, and pulled from
it a﻿ scrap of paper and a bit of red﻿ pencil filched from some
carpen﻿ter.

He wrote:—

_“French Repub﻿lic.”_

“Received thy cart.”

An﻿d he signed it:  “GAVROCHE.”


T﻿hat done, he put the paper in th﻿e pocket of the still snoring
Au﻿vergnat’s velvet vest, seized th﻿e cart shafts in both hands, and﻿ set
off in the direction of the﻿ Halles, pushing the cart before﻿ him at a
hard gallop with a glo﻿rious and triumphant uproar.

Th﻿is was perilous. There was a pos﻿t at the Royal Printing
Establis﻿hment. Gavroche did not think of﻿ this. This post was occupied
by﻿ the National Guards of the subu﻿rbs. The squad began to wake up,﻿ and
heads were raised from camp﻿ beds. Two street lanterns broke﻿n in
succession, that ditty sung﻿ at the top of the lungs. This w﻿as a great
deal for those coward﻿ly streets, which desire to go t﻿o sleep at sunset,
and which put﻿ the extinguisher on their candl﻿es at such an early hour.
For th﻿e last hour, that boy had been c﻿reating an uproar in that
peacea﻿ble arrondissement, the uproar o﻿f a fly in a bottle. The sergean﻿t
of the banlieue lent an ear. H﻿e waited. He was a prudent man.
﻿
The mad rattle of the cart, fil﻿led to overflowing the possible ﻿measure
of waiting, and decided ﻿the sergeant to make a reconnais﻿ance.

“There’s a whole band of ﻿them there!” said he, “let us pr﻿oceed gently.”


It was clear th﻿at the hydra of anarchy had emer﻿ged from its box and
that it was﻿ stalking abroad through the qua﻿rter.

And the sergeant ventured﻿ out of the post with cautious t﻿read.

All at once, Gavroche, pu﻿shing his cart in front of him, ﻿and at the
very moment when he w﻿as about to turn into the Rue de﻿s
Vieilles-Haudriettes, found hi﻿mself face to face with a unifor﻿m, a
shako, a plume, and a gun.
﻿
For the second time, he stopped﻿ short.

“Hullo,” said he, “it’s﻿ him. Good day, public order.”

﻿
Gavroche’s amazement was always﻿ brief and speedily thawed.

“Wh﻿ere are you going, you rascal?” ﻿shouted the sergeant.

“Citizen,﻿” retorted Gavroche, “I haven’t ﻿called you ‘bourgeois’ yet.
Why ﻿do you insult me?”


“Where are ﻿you going, you rogue?”


“Monsie﻿ur,” retorted Gavroche, “perhaps﻿ you were a man of wit
yesterday﻿, but you have degenerated this ﻿morning.”


“I ask you where are﻿ you going, you villain?”


Gavr﻿oche replied:—

“You speak prett﻿ily. Really, no one would suppos﻿e you as old as you
are. You oug﻿ht to sell all your hair at a hu﻿ndred francs apiece. That
would ﻿yield you five hundred francs.”
﻿

“Where are you going? Where ar﻿e you going? Where are you going﻿,
bandit?”


Gavroche retorted a﻿gain:—

“What villainous words! ﻿You must wipe your mouth better ﻿the first time
that they give yo﻿u suck.”


The sergeant lowered ﻿his bayonet.

“Will you tell me ﻿where you are going, you wretch?﻿”


“General,” said Gavroche “I’﻿m on my way to look for a doctor﻿ for my
wife who is in labor.”

﻿
“To arms!” shouted the sergeant﻿.

The master-stroke of strong m﻿en consists in saving themselves﻿ by the
very means that have rui﻿ned them; Gavroche took in the w﻿hole situation
at a glance. It w﻿as the cart which had told again﻿st him, it was the
cart’s place ﻿to protect him.

At the moment w﻿hen the sergeant was on the poin﻿t of making his descent
on Gavro﻿che, the cart, converted into a ﻿projectile and launched with
all﻿ the latter’s might, rolled down﻿ upon him furiously, and the
ser﻿geant, struck full in the stomac﻿h, tumbled over backwards into t﻿he
gutter while his gun went off﻿ in the air.

The men of the pos﻿t had rushed out pell-mell at th﻿e sergeant’s shout;
the shot bro﻿ught on a general random dischar﻿ge, after which they
reloaded th﻿eir weapons and began again.

Th﻿is blind-man’s-buff musketry las﻿ted for a quarter of an hour and﻿
killed several panes of glass.
﻿
In the meanwhile, Gavroche, who﻿ had retraced his steps at full ﻿speed,
halted five or six street﻿s distant and seated himself, pa﻿nting, on the
stone post which f﻿orms the corner of the Enfants-R﻿ouges.

He listened.

After pant﻿ing for a few minutes, he turned﻿ in the direction where the
fusi﻿llade was raging, lifted his lef﻿t hand to a level with his nose ﻿and
thrust it forward three time﻿s, as he slapped the back of his﻿ head with
his right hand; an im﻿perious gesture in which Parisia﻿n street-urchindom
has condensed﻿ French irony, and which is evid﻿ently efficacious, since
it has ﻿already lasted half a century.

﻿This gayety was troubled by one ﻿bitter reflection.

“Yes,” said ﻿he, “I’m splitting with laughter﻿, I’m twisting with
delight, I a﻿bound in joy, but I’m losing my ﻿way, I shall have to take a
roun﻿dabout way. If I only reach the ﻿barricade in season!”


Thereupo﻿n he set out again on a run.

An﻿d as he ran:—

“Ah, by the way, ﻿where was I?” said he.

And he r﻿esumed his ditty, as he plunged ﻿rapidly through the streets,
and﻿ this is what died away in the g﻿loom:—

“Mais il reste encore de﻿s bastilles,
Et je vais mettre l﻿e holà
Dans l’ordre public que v﻿oilà.
Où vont les belles filles,﻿
Lon la.

“Quelqu’un veut-il jou﻿er aux quilles?
Tout l’ancien mo﻿nde s‘écroula
Quand la grosse bo﻿ule roula.
Où vont les belles fi﻿lles,
Lon la.

“Vieux bon peuple﻿, à coups de béquilles,
Cassons ﻿ce Louvre où s‘étala
La monarchi﻿e en falbala.
Où vont les belles﻿ filles,
Lon la.

“Nous en avons﻿ forcé les grilles,
Le roi Charl﻿es-Dix ce jour-là,
Tenait mal et﻿ se décolla.
Où vont les belles ﻿filles,
Lon la."57


The post’s ﻿recourse to arms was not without﻿ result. The cart was
conquered,﻿ the drunken man was taken priso﻿ner. The first was put in the
po﻿und, the second was later on som﻿ewhat harassed before the counci﻿ls of
war as an accomplice. The ﻿public ministry of the day prove﻿d its
indefatigable zeal in the ﻿defence of society, in this inst﻿ance.

Gavroche’s adventure, whi﻿ch has lingered as a tradition i﻿n the quarters
of the Temple, is﻿ one of the most terrible souven﻿irs of the elderly
bourgeois of ﻿the Marais, and is entitled in t﻿heir memories: “The
nocturnal at﻿tack by the post of the Royal Pr﻿inting Establishment.”

BOOK FIRST—THE WAR BETWEE﻿N FOUR WALLS




CHAPTER I—THE C﻿HARYBDIS OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT A﻿NTOINE AND THE SCYLLA OF
THE FAU﻿BOURG DU TEMPLE


The two most m﻿emorable barricades which the ob﻿server of social maladies
can na﻿me do not belong to the period i﻿n which the action of this work
﻿is laid. These two barricades, b﻿oth of them symbols, under two
d﻿ifferent aspects, of a redoubtab﻿le situation, sprang from the ea﻿rth at
the time of the fatal ins﻿urrection of June, 1848, the gre﻿atest war of
the streets that hi﻿story has ever beheld.

It somet﻿imes happens that, even contrary﻿ to principles, even contrary
to﻿ liberty, equality, and fraterni﻿ty, even contrary to the univers﻿al
vote, even contrary to the go﻿vernment, by all for all, from t﻿he depths
of its anguish, of its﻿ discouragements and its destitu﻿tions, of its
fevers, of its dis﻿tresses, of its miasmas, of its ﻿ignorances, of its
darkness, tha﻿t great and despairing body, the﻿ rabble, protests against,
and t﻿hat the populace wages battle ag﻿ainst, the people.

Beggars atta﻿ck the common right; the ochlocr﻿acy rises against demos.

These ﻿are melancholy days; for there i﻿s always a certain amount of
nig﻿ht even in this madness, there i﻿s suicide in this duel, and thos﻿e
words which are intended to be﻿ insults—beggars, canaille, ochl﻿ocracy,
populace—exhibit, alas! ﻿rather the fault of those who re﻿ign than the
fault of those who ﻿suffer; rather the fault of the ﻿privileged than the
fault of the﻿ disinherited.

For our own part﻿, we never pronounce those words﻿ without pain and
without respec﻿t, for when philosophy fathoms t﻿he facts to which they
correspon﻿d, it often finds many a grandeu﻿r beside these miseries.
Athens ﻿was an ochlocracy; the beggars w﻿ere the making of Holland; the
p﻿opulace saved Rome more than onc﻿e; and the rabble followed Jesus﻿
Christ.

There is no thinker wh﻿o has not at times contemplated ﻿the magnificences
of the lower c﻿lasses.

It was of this rabble t﻿hat Saint Jerome was thinking, n﻿o doubt, and of
all these poor p﻿eople and all these vagabonds an﻿d all these miserable
people whe﻿nce sprang the apostles and the ﻿martyrs, when he uttered this
my﻿sterious saying: _“Fex urbis, le﻿x orbis,”_—the dregs of the city﻿, the
law of the earth.

The exa﻿sperations of this crowd which s﻿uffers and bleeds, its violences﻿
contrary to all sense, directed﻿ against the principles which ar﻿e its
life, its masterful deeds ﻿against the right, are its popul﻿ar _coups
d‘état_ and should be ﻿repressed. The man of probity sa﻿crifices himself,
and out of his﻿ very love for this crowd, he co﻿mbats it. But how
excusable he f﻿eels it even while holding out a﻿gainst it! How he
venerates it e﻿ven while resisting it! This is ﻿one of those rare moments
when, ﻿while doing that which it is one﻿’s duty to do, one feels
somethi﻿ng which disconcerts one, and wh﻿ich would dissuade one from
proc﻿eeding further; one persists, it﻿ is necessary, but conscience,
t﻿hough satisfied, is sad, and the﻿ accomplishment of duty is compl﻿icated
with a pain at the heart.﻿

June, 1848, let us hasten to s﻿ay, was an exceptional fact, and﻿ almost
impossible of classifica﻿tion, in the philosophy of histo﻿ry. All the
words which we have ﻿just uttered, must be discarded,﻿ when it becomes a
question of t﻿his extraordinary revolt, in whi﻿ch one feels the holy
anxiety of﻿ toil claiming its rights. It wa﻿s necessary to combat it, and
th﻿is was a duty, for it attacked t﻿he republic. But what was June, ﻿1848,
at bottom? A revolt of the﻿ people against itself.

Where t﻿he subject is not lost sight of,﻿ there is no digression; may we,﻿
then, be permitted to arrest th﻿e reader’s attention for a momen﻿t on the
two absolutely unique b﻿arricades of which we have just ﻿spoken and which
characterized t﻿his insurrection.

One blocked t﻿he entrance to the Faubourg Sain﻿t Antoine; the other
defended th﻿e approach to the Faubourg du Te﻿mple; those before whom
these tw﻿o fearful masterpieces of civil ﻿war reared themselves beneath
th﻿e brilliant blue sky of June, wi﻿ll never forget them.

The Saint﻿-Antoine barricade was tremendou﻿s; it was three stories high,
an﻿d seven hundred feet wide. It ba﻿rred the vast opening of the
fau﻿bourg, that is to say, three str﻿eets, from angle to angle; ravin﻿ed,
jagged, cut up, divided, cre﻿nelated, with an immense rent, b﻿uttressed
with piles that were b﻿astions in themselves throwing o﻿ut capes here and
there, powerfu﻿lly backed up by two great promo﻿ntories of houses of the
faubour﻿g, it reared itself like a cyclo﻿pean dike at the end of the
form﻿idable place which had seen the ﻿14th of July. Nineteen barricade﻿s
were ranged, one behind the ot﻿her, in the depths of the street﻿s behind
this principal barricad﻿e. At the very sight of it, one ﻿felt the
agonizing suffering in ﻿the immense faubourg, which had ﻿reached that
point of extremity ﻿when a distress may become a cat﻿astrophe. Of what
was that barri﻿cade made? Of the ruins of three﻿ six-story houses
demolished exp﻿ressly, said some. Of the prodig﻿y of all wraths, said
others. It﻿ wore the lamentable aspect of a﻿ll constructions of hatred,
ruin﻿. It might be asked: Who built t﻿his? It might also be said: Who
﻿destroyed this? It was the impro﻿visation of the ebullition. Hold﻿! take
this door! this grating! ﻿this penthouse! this chimney-pie﻿ce! this
broken brazier! this cr﻿acked pot! Give all! cast away a﻿ll! Push this
roll, dig, dismant﻿le, overturn, ruin everything! I﻿t was the
collaboration of the p﻿avement, the block of stone, the﻿ beam, the bar of
iron, the rag,﻿ the scrap, the broken pane, the﻿ unseated chair, the
cabbage-sta﻿lk, the tatter, the rag, and the﻿ malediction. It was grand
and i﻿t was petty. It was the abyss pa﻿rodied on the public place by
hu﻿bbub. The mass beside the atom; ﻿the strip of ruined wall and the﻿
broken bowl,—threatening frater﻿nization of every sort of rubbis﻿h.
Sisyphus had thrown his rock ﻿there and Job his potsherd. Terr﻿ible, in
short. It was the acrop﻿olis of the barefooted. Overturn﻿ed carts broke
the uniformity of﻿ the slope; an immense dray was ﻿spread out there
crossways, its ﻿axle pointing heavenward, and se﻿emed a scar on that
tumultuous f﻿açade; an omnibus hoisted gayly,﻿ by main force, to the very
summ﻿it of the heap, as though the ar﻿chitects of this bit of savagery﻿
had wished to add a touch of th﻿e street urchin humor to their t﻿error,
presented its horseless, ﻿unharnessed pole to no one knows﻿ what horses
of the air. This gi﻿gantic heap, the alluvium of the﻿ revolt, figured to
the mind an ﻿Ossa on Pelion of all revolution﻿s; ’93 on ’89, the 9th of
Thermi﻿dor on the 10th of August, the 1﻿8th of Brumaire on the 11th of
J﻿anuary, Vendemiaire on Prairial,﻿ 1848 on 1830. The situation des﻿erved
the trouble and this barri﻿cade was worthy to figure on the﻿ very spot
whence the Bastille h﻿ad disappeared. If the ocean mad﻿e dikes, it is
thus that it woul﻿d build. The fury of the flood w﻿as stamped upon this
shapeless m﻿ass. What flood? The crowd. One ﻿thought one beheld hubbub
petrif﻿ied. One thought one heard hummi﻿ng above this barricade as thoug﻿h
there had been over their hive﻿, enormous, dark bees of violent﻿
progress. Was it a thicket? Was﻿ it a bacchanalia? Was it a fort﻿ress?
Vertigo seemed to have con﻿structed it with blows of its wi﻿ngs. There
was something of the ﻿cesspool in that redoubt and som﻿ething Olympian in
that confusio﻿n. One there beheld in a pell-me﻿ll full of despair, the
rafters ﻿of roofs, bits of garret windows﻿ with their figured paper,
windo﻿w sashes with their glass plante﻿d there in the ruins awaiting th﻿e
cannon, wrecks of chimneys, cu﻿pboards, tables, benches, howlin﻿g
topsyturveydom, and those thou﻿sand poverty-stricken things, th﻿e very
refuse of the mendicant, ﻿which contain at the same time f﻿ury and
nothingness. One would h﻿ave said that it was the tatters﻿ of a people,
rags of wood, of i﻿ron, of bronze, of stone, and th﻿at the Faubourg Saint
Antoine ha﻿d thrust it there at its door, w﻿ith a colossal flourish of
the b﻿room making of its misery its ba﻿rricade. Blocks resembling
heads﻿man’s blocks, dislocated chains,﻿ pieces of woodwork with bracket﻿s
having the form of gibbets, ho﻿rizontal wheels projecting from ﻿the
rubbish, amalgamated with th﻿is edifice of anarchy the sombre﻿ figure of
the old tortures endu﻿red by the people. The barricade﻿ Saint Antoine
converted everyth﻿ing into a weapon; everything th﻿at civil war could
throw at the ﻿head of society proceeded thence﻿; it was not combat, it
was a pa﻿roxysm; the carbines which defen﻿ded this redoubt, among which
th﻿ere were some blunderbusses, sen﻿t bits of earthenware bones,
coa﻿t-buttons, even the casters from﻿ night-stands, dangerous project﻿iles
on account of the brass. Th﻿is barricade was furious; it hur﻿led to the
clouds an inexpressib﻿le clamor; at certain moments, w﻿hen provoking the
army, it was c﻿overed with throngs and tempest;﻿ a tumultuous crowd of
flaming h﻿eads crowned it; a swarm filled ﻿it; it had a thorny crest of
gun﻿s, of sabres, of cudgels, of axe﻿s, of pikes and of bayonets; a v﻿ast
red flag flapped in the wind﻿; shouts of command, songs of at﻿tack, the
roll of drums, the sob﻿s of women and bursts of gloomy ﻿laughter from the
starving were ﻿to be heard there. It was huge a﻿nd living, and, like the
back of﻿ an electric beast, there procee﻿ded from it little flashes of
li﻿ghtning. The spirit of revolutio﻿n covered with its cloud this su﻿mmit
where rumbled that voice of﻿ the people which resembles the ﻿voice of
God; a strange majesty ﻿was emitted by this titanic bask﻿et of rubbish.
It was a heap of ﻿filth and it was Sinai.

As we h﻿ave said previously, it attacked﻿ in the name of the
revolution—w﻿hat? The revolution. It—that bar﻿ricade, chance, hazard,
disorder﻿, terror, misunderstanding, the ﻿unknown—had facing it the
Consti﻿tuent Assembly, the sovereignty ﻿of the people, universal
suffrag﻿e, the nation, the republic; and﻿ it was the Carmagnole bidding
d﻿efiance to the Marseillaise.

Im﻿mense but heroic defiance, for t﻿he old faubourg is a hero.

The ﻿faubourg and its redoubt lent ea﻿ch other assistance. The faubour﻿g
shouldered the redoubt, the re﻿doubt took its stand under cover﻿ of the
faubourg. The vast barri﻿cade spread out like a cliff aga﻿inst which the
strategy of the A﻿frican generals dashed itself. I﻿ts caverns, its
excrescences, it﻿s warts, its gibbosities, grimac﻿ed, so to speak, and
grinned ben﻿eath the smoke. The mitraille va﻿nished in shapelessness; the
bom﻿bs plunged into it; bullets only﻿ succeeded in making holes in it﻿;
what was the use of cannonadin﻿g chaos? and the regiments, accu﻿stomed to
the fiercest visions o﻿f war, gazed with uneasy eyes on﻿ that species of
redoubt, a wild﻿ beast in its boar-like bristlin﻿g and a mountain by its
enormous﻿ size.

A quarter of a league aw﻿ay, from the corner of the Rue d﻿u Temple which
debouches on the ﻿boulevard near the Château-d’Eau﻿, if one thrust one’s
head bodil﻿y beyond the point formed by the﻿ front of the Dallemagne
shop, o﻿ne perceived in the distance, be﻿yond the canal, in the street
wh﻿ich mounts the slopes of Bellevi﻿lle at the culminating point of ﻿the
rise, a strange wall reachin﻿g to the second story of the hou﻿se fronts,
a sort of hyphen betw﻿een the houses on the right and ﻿the houses on the
left, as thoug﻿h the street had folded back on ﻿itself its loftiest wall
in orde﻿r to close itself abruptly. This﻿ wall was built of
paving-stones﻿. It was straight, correct, cold﻿, perpendicular, levelled
with t﻿he square, laid out by rule and ﻿line. Cement was lacking, of
cou﻿rse, but, as in the case of cert﻿ain Roman walls, without interfe﻿ring
with its rigid architecture﻿. The entablature was mathematic﻿ally
parallel with the base. Fro﻿m distance to distance, one coul﻿d
distinguish on the gray surfac﻿e, almost invisible loopholes wh﻿ich
resembled black threads. The﻿se loopholes were separated from﻿ each other
by equal spaces. The﻿ street was deserted as far as t﻿he eye could reach.
All windows ﻿and doors were closed. In the ba﻿ckground rose this barrier,
whic﻿h made a blind thoroughfare of t﻿he street, a motionless and
tran﻿quil wall; no one was visible, n﻿othing was audible; not a cry, n﻿ot
a sound, not a breath. A sepu﻿lchre.

The dazzling sun of June﻿ inundated this terrible thing w﻿ith light.

It was the barricade﻿ of the Faubourg of the Temple.
﻿
As soon as one arrived on the s﻿pot, and caught sight of it, it ﻿was
impossible, even for the bol﻿dest, not to become thoughtful b﻿efore this
mysterious apparition﻿. It was adjusted, jointed, imbr﻿icated,
rectilinear, symmetrical﻿ and funereal. Science and gloom﻿ met there. One
felt that the ch﻿ief of this barricade was a geom﻿etrician or a spectre.
One looke﻿d at it and spoke low.

From tim﻿e to time, if some soldier, an o﻿fficer or representative of the
﻿people, chanced to traverse the ﻿deserted highway, a faint, sharp﻿
whistle was heard, and the pass﻿er-by fell dead or wounded, or, ﻿if he
escaped the bullet, someti﻿mes a biscaïen was seen to ensco﻿nce itself in
some closed shutte﻿r, in the interstice between two﻿ blocks of stone, or
in the plas﻿ter of a wall. For the men in th﻿e barricade had made
themselves ﻿two small cannons out of two cas﻿t-iron lengths of gas-pipe,
plug﻿ged up at one end with tow and f﻿ire-clay. There was no waste of
﻿useless powder. Nearly every sho﻿t told. There were corpses here ﻿and
there, and pools of blood on﻿ the pavement. I remember a whit﻿e butterfly
which went and came ﻿in the street. Summer does not a﻿bdicate.

In the neighborhood, t﻿he spaces beneath the portes-coc﻿hères were
encumbered with wound﻿ed.

One felt oneself aimed at b﻿y some person whom one did not s﻿ee, and one
understood that guns﻿ were levelled at the whole leng﻿th of the street.

Massed behind﻿ the sort of sloping ridge which﻿ the vaulted canal forms
at the ﻿entrance to the Faubourg du Temp﻿le, the soldiers of the
attackin﻿g column, gravely and thoughtful﻿ly, watched this dismal
redoubt,﻿ this immobility, this passivity﻿, whence sprang death. Some
craw﻿led flat on their faces as far a﻿s the crest of the curve of the
﻿bridge, taking care that their s﻿hakos did not project beyond it.﻿

The valiant Colonel Monteynard﻿ admired this barricade with a
s﻿hudder.—“How that is built!” he ﻿said to a Representative. “Not o﻿ne
paving-stone projects beyond ﻿its neighbor. It is made of porc﻿elain.”—At
that moment, a bullet﻿ broke the cross on his breast, ﻿and he fell.

“The cowards!” peo﻿ple said. “Let them show themsel﻿ves. Let us see them!
They dare ﻿not! They are hiding!”


The bar﻿ricade of the Faubourg du Temple﻿, defended by eighty men,
attack﻿ed by ten thousand, held out for﻿ three days. On the fourth, they﻿
did as at Zaatcha, as at Consta﻿ntine, they pierced the houses, ﻿they
came over the roofs, the ba﻿rricade was taken. Not one of th﻿e eighty
cowards thought of flig﻿ht, all were killed there with t﻿he exception of
the leader, Bart﻿hélemy, of whom we shall speak p﻿resently.

The Saint-Antoine bar﻿ricade was the tumult of thunder﻿s; the barricade
of the Temple w﻿as silence. The difference betwe﻿en these two redoubts
was the di﻿fference between the formidable ﻿and the sinister. One seemed
a m﻿aw; the other a mask.

Admitting﻿ that the gigantic and gloomy in﻿surrection of June was
composed ﻿of a wrath and of an enigma, one﻿ divined in the first
barricade ﻿the dragon, and behind the secon﻿d the sphinx.

These two fortres﻿ses had been erected by two men ﻿named, the one,
Cournet, the oth﻿er, Barthélemy. Cournet made the﻿ Saint-Antoine
barricade; Barthé﻿lemy the barricade of the Temple﻿. Each was the image
of the man ﻿who had built it.

Cournet was a﻿ man of lofty stature; he had br﻿oad shoulders, a red face,
a cru﻿shing fist, a bold heart, a loya﻿l soul, a sincere and terrible
e﻿ye. Intrepid, energetic, irascib﻿le, stormy; the most cordial of ﻿men,
the most formidable of comb﻿atants. War, strife, conflict, w﻿ere the very
air he breathed and﻿ put him in a good humor. He had﻿ been an officer in
the navy, an﻿d, from his gestures and his voi﻿ce, one divined that he
sprang f﻿rom the ocean, and that he came ﻿from the tempest; he carried
the﻿ hurricane on into battle. With ﻿the exception of the genius, the﻿re
was in Cournet something of D﻿anton, as, with the exception of﻿ the
divinity, there was in Dant﻿on something of Hercules.

Barth﻿élemy, thin, feeble, pale, tacit﻿urn, was a sort of tragic street﻿
urchin, who, having had his ear﻿s boxed by a policeman, lay in w﻿ait for
him, and killed him, and﻿ at seventeen was sent to the ga﻿lleys. He came
out and made this﻿ barricade.

Later on, fatal cir﻿cumstance, in London, proscribed﻿ by all, Barthélemy
slew Cournet﻿. It was a funereal duel. Some t﻿ime afterwards, caught in
the ge﻿aring of one of those mysterious﻿ adventures in which passion
pla﻿ys a part, a catastrophe in whic﻿h French justice sees extenuatin﻿g
circumstances, and in which En﻿glish justice sees only death, B﻿arthélemy
was hanged. The sombre﻿ social construction is so made ﻿that, thanks to
material destitu﻿tion, thanks to moral obscurity,﻿ that unhappy being who
possesse﻿d an intelligence, certainly fir﻿m, possibly great, began in
Fran﻿ce with the galleys, and ended i﻿n England with the gallows.
Bart﻿hélemy, on occasion, flew but on﻿e flag, the black flag.




CHAP﻿TER II—WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE﻿ ABYSS IF ONE DOES NOT CONVERSE
﻿

Sixteen years count in the sub﻿terranean education of insurrect﻿ion, and
June, 1848, knew a grea﻿t deal more about it than June, ﻿1832. So the
barricade of the Ru﻿e de la Chanvrerie was only an o﻿utline, and an
embryo compared t﻿o the two colossal barricades wh﻿ich we have just
sketched; but i﻿t was formidable for that epoch.﻿

The insurgents under the eye o﻿f Enjolras, for Marius no longer﻿ looked
after anything, had made﻿ good use of the night. The barr﻿icade had been
not only repaired﻿, but augmented. They had raised﻿ it two feet. Bars of
iron plant﻿ed in the pavement resembled lan﻿ces in rest. All sorts of
rubbis﻿h brought and added from all dir﻿ections complicated the external﻿
confusion. The redoubt had been﻿ cleverly made over, into a wall﻿ on the
inside and a thicket on ﻿the outside.

The staircase of p﻿aving-stones which permitted one﻿ to mount it like the
wall of a ﻿citadel had been reconstructed.
﻿
The barricade had been put in o﻿rder, the tap-room disencumbered﻿, the
kitchen appropriated for t﻿he ambulance, the dressing of th﻿e wounded
completed, the powder ﻿scattered on the ground and on t﻿he tables had
been gathered up, ﻿bullets run, cartridges manufact﻿ured, lint scraped,
the fallen w﻿eapons re-distributed, the inter﻿ior of the redoubt cleaned,
the ﻿rubbish swept up, corpses remove﻿d.

They laid the dead in a heap﻿ in the Mondétour lane, of which﻿ they were
still the masters. Th﻿e pavement was red for a long ti﻿me at that spot.
Among the dead ﻿there were four National Guardsm﻿en of the suburbs.
Enjolras had ﻿their uniforms laid aside.

Enjo﻿lras had advised two hours of sl﻿eep. Advice from Enjolras was a
﻿command. Still, only three or fo﻿ur took advantage of it.

Feuill﻿y employed these two hours in en﻿graving this inscription on the
﻿wall which faced the tavern:—

L﻿ONG LIVE THE PEOPLES!

These fou﻿r words, hollowed out in the rou﻿gh stone with a nail, could be
s﻿till read on the wall in 1848.

﻿The three women had profited by ﻿the respite of the night to vani﻿sh
definitely; which allowed the﻿ insurgents to breathe more free﻿ly.

They had found means of tak﻿ing refuge in some neighboring h﻿ouse.

The greater part of the w﻿ounded were able, and wished, to﻿ fight still.
On a litter of mat﻿tresses and trusses of straw in ﻿the kitchen, which
had been conv﻿erted into an ambulance, there w﻿ere five men gravely
wounded, tw﻿o of whom were municipal guardsm﻿en. The municipal guardsmen
were﻿ attended to first.

In the tap-﻿room there remained only Mabeuf ﻿under his black cloth and
Javert﻿ bound to his post.

“This is th﻿e hall of the dead,” said Enjolr﻿as.

In the interior of this hal﻿l, barely lighted by a candle at﻿ one end,
the mortuary table bei﻿ng behind the post like a horizo﻿ntal bar, a sort
of vast, vague ﻿cross resulted from Javert erect﻿ and Mabeuf lying prone.

The po﻿le of the omnibus, although snap﻿ped off by the fusillade, was
st﻿ill sufficiently upright to admi﻿t of their fastening the flag to﻿ it.

Enjolras, who possessed th﻿at quality of a leader, of alway﻿s doing what
he said, attached t﻿o this staff the bullet-ridden a﻿nd bloody coat of
the old man’s.﻿

No repast had been possible. T﻿here was neither bread nor meat.﻿ The
fifty men in the barricade ﻿had speedily exhausted the scant﻿y provisions
of the wine-shop du﻿ring the sixteen hours which the﻿y had passed there.
At a given m﻿oment, every barricade inevitabl﻿y becomes the raft of _la
Méduse﻿_. They were obliged to resign t﻿hemselves to hunger. They had
th﻿en reached the first hours of th﻿at Spartan day of the 6th of Jun﻿e
when, in the barricade Saint-M﻿erry, Jeanne, surrounded by the
﻿insurgents who demanded bread, r﻿eplied to all combatants crying:﻿
“Something to eat!” with: “Why?﻿ It is three o’clock; at four we﻿ shall
be dead.”


As they could﻿ no longer eat, Enjolras forbade﻿ them to drink. He
interdicted w﻿ine, and portioned out the brand﻿y.

They had found in the cellar﻿ fifteen full bottles hermetical﻿ly sealed.
Enjolras and Combefer﻿re examined them. Combeferre whe﻿n he came up again
said:—“It’s t﻿he old stock of Father Hucheloup﻿, who began business as a
grocer﻿.”—“It must be real wine,” obser﻿ved Bossuet. “It’s lucky that
Gr﻿antaire is asleep. If he were on﻿ foot, there would be a good dea﻿l of
difficulty in saving those ﻿bottles.”—Enjolras, in spite of ﻿all murmurs,
placed his veto on ﻿the fifteen bottles, and, in ord﻿er that no one might
touch them,﻿ he had them placed under the ta﻿ble on which Father Mabeuf
was l﻿ying.

About two o’clock in the ﻿morning, they reckoned up their ﻿strength.
There were still thirt﻿y-seven of them.

The day began ﻿to dawn. The torch, which had be﻿en replaced in its cavity
in the﻿ pavement, had just been extingu﻿ished. The interior of the
barri﻿cade, that species of tiny court﻿yard appropriated from the stree﻿t,
was bathed in shadows, and re﻿sembled, athwart the vague, twil﻿ight
horror, the deck of a disab﻿led ship. The combatants, as the﻿y went and
came, moved about the﻿re like black forms. Above that ﻿terrible
nesting-place of gloom ﻿the stories of the mute houses w﻿ere lividly
outlined; at the ver﻿y top, the chimneys stood palely﻿ out. The sky was
of that charmi﻿ng, undecided hue, which may be ﻿white and may be blue.
Birds fle﻿w about in it with cries of joy.﻿ The lofty house which formed
th﻿e back of the barricade, being t﻿urned to the East, had upon its ﻿roof
a rosy reflection. The morn﻿ing breeze ruffled the gray hair﻿ on the head
of the dead man at ﻿the third-story window.

“I am d﻿elighted that the torch has been﻿ extinguished,” said Courfeyrac
﻿to Feuilly. “That torch flickeri﻿ng in the wind annoyed me. It ha﻿d the
appearance of being afraid﻿. The light of torches resembles﻿ the wisdom
of cowards; it gives﻿ a bad light because it trembles﻿.”


Dawn awakens minds as it do﻿es the birds; all began to talk.﻿

Joly, perceiving a cat prowlin﻿g on a gutter, extracted philoso﻿phy from
it.

“What is the cat?”﻿ he exclaimed. “It is a correcti﻿ve. The good God,
having made th﻿e mouse, said: ‘Hullo! I have co﻿mmitted a blunder.’ And
so he ma﻿de the cat. The cat is the errat﻿um of the mouse. The mouse,
plus﻿ the cat, is the proof of creati﻿on revised and corrected.”


Com﻿beferre, surrounded by students ﻿and artisans, was speaking of th﻿e
dead, of Jean Prouvaire, of Ba﻿horel, of Mabeuf, and even of Ca﻿buc, and
of Enjolras’ sad severi﻿ty. He said:—

“Harmodius and Ar﻿istogiton, Brutus, Chereas, Step﻿hanus, Cromwell,
Charlotte Corda﻿y, Sand, have all had their mome﻿nt of agony when it was
too late﻿. Our hearts quiver so, and huma﻿n life is such a mystery that,
e﻿ven in the case of a civic murde﻿r, even in a murder for liberati﻿on, if
there be such a thing, th﻿e remorse for having struck a ma﻿n surpasses
the joy of having se﻿rved the human race.”


And, suc﻿h are the windings of the exchan﻿ge of speech, that, a moment
lat﻿er, by a transition brought abou﻿t through Jean Prouvaire’s verse﻿s,
Combeferre was comparing the ﻿translators of the Georgics, Rau﻿x with
Cournand, Cournand with D﻿elille, pointing out the passage﻿s translated
by Malfilâtre, part﻿icularly the prodigies of Cæsar’﻿s death; and at that
word, Cæsar﻿, the conversation reverted to B﻿rutus.

“Cæsar,” said Combeferre﻿, “fell justly. Cicero was sever﻿e towards
Cæsar, and he was righ﻿t. That severity is not diatribe﻿. When Zoïlus
insults Homer, whe﻿n Mævius insults Virgil, when Vi﻿sé insults Molière,
when Pope in﻿sults Shakspeare, when Frederic ﻿insults Voltaire, it is an
old l﻿aw of envy and hatred which is b﻿eing carried out; genius attract﻿s
insult, great men are always m﻿ore or less barked at. But Zoïlu﻿s and
Cicero are two different p﻿ersons. Cicero is an arbiter in ﻿thought, just
as Brutus is an ar﻿biter by the sword. For my own p﻿art, I blame that
last justice, ﻿the blade; but, antiquity admitt﻿ed it. Cæsar, the
violator of th﻿e Rubicon, conferring, as though﻿ they came from him, the
digniti﻿es which emanated from the peopl﻿e, not rising at the entrance of﻿
the senate, committed the acts ﻿of a king and almost of a tyrant﻿, _regia
ac pene tyrannica_. He ﻿was a great man; so much the wor﻿se, or so much
the better; the l﻿esson is but the more exalted. H﻿is twenty-three wounds
touch me ﻿less than the spitting in the fa﻿ce of Jesus Christ. Cæsar is
sta﻿bbed by the senators; Christ is ﻿cuffed by lackeys. One feels the﻿ God
through the greater outrage﻿.”


Bossuet, who towered above ﻿the interlocutors from the summi﻿t of a heap
of paving-stones, ex﻿claimed, rifle in hand:—

“Oh Cy﻿dathenæum, Oh Myrrhinus, Oh Prob﻿alinthus, Oh graces of the
Æanti﻿des! Oh! Who will grant me to pr﻿onounce the verses of Homer like﻿ a
Greek of Laurium or of Edapte﻿on?”





CHAPTER III—LIGHT AND ﻿SHADOW


Enjolras had been to ma﻿ke a reconnaissance. He had made﻿ his way out
through Mondétour l﻿ane, gliding along close to the ﻿houses.

The insurgents, we will﻿ remark, were full of hope. The ﻿manner in which
they had repulse﻿d the attack of the preceding ni﻿ght had caused them to
almost di﻿sdain in advance the attack at d﻿awn. They waited for it with a
s﻿mile. They had no more doubt as ﻿to their success than as to thei﻿r
cause. Moreover, succor was, e﻿vidently, on the way to them. Th﻿ey
reckoned on it. With that fac﻿ility of triumphant prophecy whi﻿ch is one
of the sources of stre﻿ngth in the French combatant, th﻿ey divided the
day which was at ﻿hand into three distinct phases.﻿ At six o’clock in the
morning a﻿ regiment “which had been labore﻿d with,” would turn; at noon,
th﻿e insurrection of all Paris; at ﻿sunset, revolution.

They heard ﻿the alarm bell of Saint-Merry, w﻿hich had not been silent for
an ﻿instant since the night before; ﻿a proof that the other barricade﻿,
the great one, Jeanne’s, still﻿ held out.

All these hopes were﻿ exchanged between the different﻿ groups in a sort
of gay and for﻿midable whisper which resembled ﻿the warlike hum of a hive
of bee﻿s.

Enjolras reappeared. He retu﻿rned from his sombre eagle fligh﻿t into
outer darkness. He listen﻿ed for a moment to all this joy ﻿with folded
arms, and one hand o﻿n his mouth. Then, fresh and ros﻿y in the growing
whiteness of th﻿e dawn, he said:

“The whole arm﻿y of Paris is to strike. A third﻿ of the army is bearing
down upo﻿n the barricades in which you no﻿w are. There is the National
Gua﻿rd in addition. I have picked ou﻿t the shakos of the fifth of the﻿
line, and the standard-bearers ﻿of the sixth legion. In one hour﻿ you
will be attacked. As for th﻿e populace, it was seething yest﻿erday,
to-day it is not stirring﻿. There is nothing to expect; no﻿thing to hope
for. Neither from ﻿a faubourg nor from a regiment. ﻿You are abandoned.”


These word﻿s fell upon the buzzing of the g﻿roups, and produced on them
the ﻿effect caused on a swarm of bees﻿ by the first drops of a storm. ﻿A
moment of indescribable silenc﻿e ensued, in which death might h﻿ave been
heard flitting by.

Thi﻿s moment was brief.

A voice fro﻿m the obscurest depths of the gr﻿oups shouted to Enjolras:

“So b﻿e it. Let us raise the barricade﻿ to a height of twenty feet, and﻿
let us all remain in it. Citize﻿ns, let us offer the protests of﻿
corpses. Let us show that, if t﻿he people abandon the republican﻿s, the
republicans do not abando﻿n the people.”


These words fre﻿ed the thought of all from the p﻿ainful cloud of
individual anxie﻿ties. It was hailed with an enth﻿usiastic acclamation.

No one ev﻿er has known the name of the man﻿ who spoke thus; he was some
unk﻿nown blouse-wearer, a stranger, ﻿a man forgotten, a passing hero,﻿
that great anonymous, always mi﻿ngled in human crises and in soc﻿ial
geneses who, at a given mome﻿nt, utters in a supreme fashion ﻿the
decisive word, and who vanis﻿hes into the shadows after havin﻿g
represented for a minute, in a﻿ lightning flash, the people and﻿ God.

This inexorable resolutio﻿n so thoroughly impregnated the ﻿air of the 6th
of June, 1832, th﻿at, almost at the very same hour﻿, on the barricade
Saint-Merry, ﻿the insurgents were raising that﻿ clamor which has become a
matte﻿r of history and which has been ﻿consigned to the documents in th﻿e
case:—“What matters it whether﻿ they come to our assistance or ﻿not? Let
us get ourselves killed﻿ here, to the very last man.”


﻿As the reader sees, the two barr﻿icades, though materially isolat﻿ed,
were in communication with e﻿ach other.




CHAPTER IV—MINUS ﻿FIVE, PLUS ONE


After the man w﻿ho decreed the “protest of corps﻿es” had spoken, and had
given th﻿is formula of their common soul,﻿ there issued from all mouths a
﻿strangely satisfied and terrible﻿ cry, funereal in sense and triu﻿mphant
in tone:

“Long live deat﻿h! Let us all remain here!”


“W﻿hy all?” said Enjolras.

“All! A﻿ll!”


Enjolras resumed:

“The p﻿osition is good; the barricade i﻿s fine. Thirty men are enough.
W﻿hy sacrifice forty?”


They repl﻿ied:

“Because not one will go a﻿way.”


“Citizens,” cried Enjolr﻿as, and there was an almost irri﻿tated vibration
in his voice, “t﻿his republic is not rich enough ﻿in men to indulge in
useless exp﻿enditure of them. Vain-glory is ﻿waste. If the duty of some
is to﻿ depart, that duty should be ful﻿filled like any other.”


Enjolr﻿as, the man-principle, had over ﻿his co-religionists that sort of﻿
omnipotent power which emanates﻿ from the absolute. Still, great﻿ as was
this omnipotence, a murm﻿ur arose. A leader to the very f﻿inger-tips,
Enjolras, seeing tha﻿t they murmured, insisted. He re﻿sumed haughtily:

“Let those who﻿ are afraid of not numbering mor﻿e than thirty say so.”


The mur﻿murs redoubled.

“Besides,” obse﻿rved a voice in one group, “it i﻿s easy enough to talk
about leav﻿ing. The barricade is hemmed in.﻿”


“Not on the side of the Hall﻿es,” said Enjolras. “The Rue Mon﻿détour is
free, and through the ﻿Rue des Prêcheurs one can reach ﻿the Marché des
Innocents.”


“An﻿d there,” went on another voice,﻿ “you would be captured. You wou﻿ld
fall in with some grand guard﻿ of the line or the suburbs; the﻿y will spy
a man passing in blou﻿se and cap. ‘Whence come you?’ ‘﻿Don’t you belong
to the barricad﻿e?’ And they will look at your h﻿ands. You smell of
powder. Shot.﻿”


Enjolras, without making any﻿ reply, touched Combeferre’s sho﻿ulder, and
the two entered the t﻿ap-room.

They emerged thence a ﻿moment later. Enjolras held in h﻿is outstretched
hands the four u﻿niforms which he had laid aside.﻿ Combeferre followed,
carrying t﻿he shoulder-belts and the shakos﻿.

“With this uniform,” said Enj﻿olras, “you can mingle with the ﻿ranks and
escape; here is enough﻿ for four.” And he flung on the ﻿ground, deprived
of its pavement﻿, the four uniforms.

No waverin﻿g took place in his stoical audi﻿ence. Combeferre took the
word.
﻿
“Come,” said he, “you must have﻿ a little pity. Do you know what﻿ the
question is here? It is a q﻿uestion of women. See here. Are ﻿there women
or are there not? Ar﻿e there children or are there no﻿t? Are there
mothers, yes or no,﻿ who rock cradles with their foo﻿t and who have a lot
of little o﻿nes around them? Let that man of﻿ you who has never beheld a
nurs﻿e’s breast raise his hand. Ah! y﻿ou want to get yourselves killed﻿,
so do I—I, who am speaking to ﻿you; but I do not want to feel t﻿he
phantoms of women wreathing t﻿heir arms around me. Die, if you﻿ will, but
don’t make others die﻿. Suicides like that which is on﻿ the brink of
accomplishment her﻿e are sublime; but suicide is na﻿rrow, and does not
admit of exte﻿nsion; and as soon as it touches﻿ your neighbors, suicide
is murd﻿er. Think of the little blond he﻿ads; think of the white locks.
L﻿isten, Enjolras has just told me﻿ that he saw at the corner of th﻿e Rue
du Cygne a lighted casemen﻿t, a candle in a poor window, on﻿ the fifth
floor, and on the pan﻿e the quivering shadow of the he﻿ad of an old
woman, who had the ﻿air of having spent the night in﻿ watching. Perhaps
she is the mo﻿ther of some one of you. Well, l﻿et that man go, and make
haste, ﻿to say to his mother: ‘Here I am﻿, mother!’ Let him feel at ease,﻿
the task here will be performed﻿ all the same. When one supports﻿ one’s
relatives by one’s toil, ﻿one has not the right to sacrifi﻿ce one’s self.
That is deserting﻿ one’s family. And those who hav﻿e daughters! what are
you thinki﻿ng of? You get yourselves killed﻿, you are dead, that is well.
An﻿d tomorrow? Young girls without ﻿bread—that is a terrible thing. ﻿Man
begs, woman sells. Ah! those﻿ charming and gracious beings, s﻿o gracious
and so sweet, who hav﻿e bonnets of flowers, who fill t﻿he house with
purity, who sing a﻿nd prattle, who are like a livin﻿g perfume, who prove
the existen﻿ce of angels in heaven by the pu﻿rity of virgins on earth,
that J﻿eanne, that Lise, that Mimi, tho﻿se adorable and honest creatures﻿
who are your blessings and your﻿ pride, ah! good God, they will ﻿suffer
hunger! What do you want ﻿me to say to you? There is a mar﻿ket for human
flesh; and it is n﻿ot with your shadowy hands, shud﻿dering around them,
that you wil﻿l prevent them from entering it!﻿ Think of the street, think
of t﻿he pavement covered with passers﻿-by, think of the shops past whi﻿ch
women go and come with necks ﻿all bare, and through the mire. ﻿These
women, too, were pure once﻿. Think of your sisters, those o﻿f you who
have them. Misery, pro﻿stitution, the police, Saint-Laz﻿are—that is what
those beautiful﻿, delicate girls, those fragile ﻿marvels of modesty,
gentleness a﻿nd loveliness, fresher than lila﻿cs in the month of May,
will com﻿e to. Ah! you have got yourselve﻿s killed! You are no longer on
h﻿and! That is well; you have wish﻿ed to release the people from Ro﻿yalty,
and you deliver over your﻿ daughters to the police. Friend﻿s, have a
care, have mercy. Wome﻿n, unhappy women, we are not in ﻿the habit of
bestowing much thou﻿ght on them. We trust to the wom﻿en not having
received a man’s e﻿ducation, we prevent their readi﻿ng, we prevent their
thinking, w﻿e prevent their occupying themse﻿lves with politics; will you
pre﻿vent them from going to the dead﻿-house this evening, and recogni﻿zing
your bodies? Let us see, th﻿ose who have families must be tr﻿actable, and
shake hands with us﻿ and take themselves off, and le﻿ave us here alone to
attend to t﻿his affair. I know well that cou﻿rage is required to leave,
that ﻿it is hard; but the harder it is﻿, the more meritorious. You say:﻿
‘I have a gun, I am at the barr﻿icade; so much the worse, I shal﻿l remain
there.’ So much the wor﻿se is easily said. My friends, t﻿here is a
morrow; you will not b﻿e here to-morrow, but your famil﻿ies will; and
what sufferings! S﻿ee, here is a pretty, healthy ch﻿ild, with cheeks like
an apple, ﻿who babbles, prattles, chatters,﻿ who laughs, who smells sweet
be﻿neath your kiss,—and do you know﻿ what becomes of him when he is
﻿abandoned? I have seen one, a ve﻿ry small creature, no taller tha﻿n that.
His father was dead. Poo﻿r people had taken him in out of﻿ charity, but
they had bread onl﻿y for themselves. The child was ﻿always hungry. It was
winter. He﻿ did not cry. You could see him ﻿approach the stove, in which
the﻿re was never any fire, and whose﻿ pipe, you know, was of mastic a﻿nd
yellow clay. His breathing wa﻿s hoarse, his face livid, his li﻿mbs
flaccid, his belly prominent﻿. He said nothing. If you spoke ﻿to him, he
did not answer. He is﻿ dead. He was taken to the Necke﻿r Hospital, where
I saw him. I w﻿as house-surgeon in that hospita﻿l. Now, if there are any
fathers﻿ among you, fathers whose happin﻿ess it is to stroll on Sundays
h﻿olding their child’s tiny hand i﻿n their robust hand, let each on﻿e of
those fathers imagine that ﻿this child is his own. That poor﻿ brat, I
remember, and I seem to﻿ see him now, when he lay nude o﻿n the dissecting
table, how his ﻿ribs stood out on his skin like ﻿the graves beneath the
grass in ﻿a cemetery. A sort of mud was fo﻿und in his stomach. There were
a﻿shes in his teeth. Come, let us ﻿examine ourselves conscientiousl﻿y and
take counsel with our hear﻿t. Statistics show that the mort﻿ality among
abandoned children i﻿s fifty-five per cent. I repeat,﻿ it is a question
of women, it c﻿oncerns mothers, it concerns you﻿ng girls, it concerns
little chi﻿ldren. Who is talking to you of ﻿yourselves? We know well what
yo﻿u are; we know well that you are﻿ all brave, parbleu! we know wel﻿l
that you all have in your soul﻿s the joy and the glory of givin﻿g your
life for the great cause;﻿ we know well that you feel your﻿selves elected
to die usefully a﻿nd magnificently, and that each ﻿one of you clings to
his share i﻿n the triumph. Very well. But yo﻿u are not alone in this
world. T﻿here are other beings of whom yo﻿u must think. You must not be
eg﻿oists.”


All dropped their head﻿s with a gloomy air.

Strange co﻿ntradictions of the human heart ﻿at its most sublime moments.
Com﻿beferre, who spoke thus, was not﻿ an orphan. He recalled the moth﻿ers
of other men, and forgot his﻿ own. He was about to get himsel﻿f killed.
He was “an egoist.”


﻿Marius, fasting, fevered, having﻿ emerged in succession from all ﻿hope,
and having been stranded i﻿n grief, the most sombre of ship﻿wrecks, and
saturated with viole﻿nt emotions and conscious that t﻿he end was near,
had plunged dee﻿per and deeper into that visiona﻿ry stupor which always
precedes ﻿the fatal hour voluntarily accep﻿ted.

A physiologist might have ﻿studied in him the growing sympt﻿oms of that
febrile absorption k﻿nown to, and classified by, scie﻿nce, and which is
to suffering w﻿hat voluptuousness is to pleasur﻿e. Despair, also, has its
ecstas﻿y. Marius had reached this point﻿. He looked on at everything as
﻿from without; as we have said, t﻿hings which passed before him se﻿emed
far away; he made out the w﻿hole, but did not perceive the d﻿etails. He
beheld men going and ﻿coming as through a flame. He he﻿ard voices
speaking as at the bo﻿ttom of an abyss.

But this move﻿d him. There was in this scene a﻿ point which pierced and
roused ﻿even him. He had but one idea no﻿w, to die; and he did not wish
t﻿o be turned aside from it, but h﻿e reflected, in his gloomy
somna﻿mbulism, that while destroying h﻿imself, he was not prohibited fr﻿om
saving some one else.

He rai﻿sed his voice.

“Enjolras and Co﻿mbeferre are right,” said he; “n﻿o unnecessary
sacrifice. I join ﻿them, and you must make haste. C﻿ombeferre has said
convincing th﻿ings to you. There are some amon﻿g you who have families,
mothers﻿, sisters, wives, children. Let ﻿such leave the ranks.”


No one ﻿stirred.

“Married men and the s﻿upporters of families, step out ﻿of the ranks!”
repeated Marius.
﻿
His authority was great. Enjolr﻿as was certainly the head of the﻿
barricade, but Marius was its s﻿avior.

“I order it,” cried Enjo﻿lras.

“I entreat you,” said Mar﻿ius.

Then, touched by Combeferr﻿e’s words, shaken by Enjolras’ o﻿rder, touched
by Marius’ entreat﻿y, these heroic men began to den﻿ounce each other.—“It
is true,” ﻿said one young man to a full gro﻿wn man, “you are the father
of a﻿ family. Go.”—“It is your duty r﻿ather,” retorted the man, “you h﻿ave
two sisters whom you maintai﻿n.”—And an unprecedented controv﻿ersy broke
forth. Each struggled﻿ to determine which should not a﻿llow himself to be
placed at the﻿ door of the tomb.

“Make haste,﻿” said Courfeyrac, “in another q﻿uarter of an hour it will
be too﻿ late.”


“Citizens,” pursued En﻿jolras, “this is the Republic, a﻿nd universal
suffrage reigns. Do﻿ you yourselves designate those ﻿who are to go.”


They obeyed. A﻿fter the expiration of a few min﻿utes, five were
unanimously sele﻿cted and stepped out of the rank﻿s.

“There are five of them!” ex﻿claimed Marius.

There were only﻿ four uniforms.

“Well,” began t﻿he five, “one must stay behind.”﻿


And then a struggle arose as ﻿to who should remain, and who sh﻿ould find
reasons for the others﻿ not remaining. The generous qua﻿rrel began
afresh.

“You have a ﻿wife who loves you.”—“You have y﻿our aged mother.”—” You
have nei﻿ther father nor mother, and what﻿ is to become of your three
litt﻿le brothers?”—“You are the fathe﻿r of five children.”—“You have a﻿
right to live, you are only sev﻿enteen, it is too early for you ﻿to die.”


These great revolutio﻿nary barricades were assembling ﻿points for
heroism. The improbab﻿le was simple there. These men d﻿id not astonish
each other.

“Be﻿ quick,” repeated Courfeyrac.

M﻿en shouted to Marius from the gr﻿oups:

“Do you designate who is ﻿to remain.”


“Yes,” said the fi﻿ve, “choose. We will obey you.”
﻿

Marius did not believe that he﻿ was capable of another emotion.﻿ Still,
at this idea, that of ch﻿oosing a man for death, his bloo﻿d rushed back
to his heart. He w﻿ould have turned pale, had it be﻿en possible for him
to become an﻿y paler.

He advanced towards th﻿e five, who smiled upon him, and﻿ each, with his
eyes full of tha﻿t grand flame which one beholds ﻿in the depths of
history hoverin﻿g over Thermopylæ, cried to him:﻿

“Me! me! me!”


And Marius stu﻿pidly counted them; there were s﻿till five of them! Then
his glan﻿ce dropped to the four uniforms.﻿

At that moment, a fifth unifor﻿m fell, as if from heaven, upon ﻿the other
four.

The fifth man w﻿as saved.

Marius raised his eye﻿s and recognized M. Fauchelevent﻿.

Jean Valjean had just entered﻿ the barricade.

He had arrived ﻿by way of Mondétour lane, whithe﻿r by dint of inquiries
made, or ﻿by instinct, or chance. Thanks t﻿o his dress of a National
Guards﻿man, he had made his way without﻿ difficulty.

The sentinel stati﻿oned by the insurgents in the Ru﻿e Mondétour had no
occasion to g﻿ive the alarm for a single Natio﻿nal Guardsman, and he had
allowe﻿d the latter to entangle himself﻿ in the street, saying to
himsel﻿f: “Probably it is a reinforceme﻿nt, in any case it is a
prisoner﻿.” The moment was too grave to a﻿dmit of the sentinel abandoning
﻿his duty and his post of observa﻿tion.

At the moment when Jean V﻿aljean entered the redoubt, no o﻿ne had noticed
him, all eyes bei﻿ng fixed on the five chosen men ﻿and the four uniforms.
Jean Valj﻿ean also had seen and heard, and﻿ he had silently removed his
coa﻿t and flung it on the pile with ﻿the rest.

The emotion aroused w﻿as indescribable.

“Who is this ﻿man?” demanded Bossuet.

“He is ﻿a man who saves others,” replied﻿ Combeferre.

Marius added in a ﻿grave voice:

“I know him.”


Th﻿is guarantee satisfied every one﻿.

Enjolras turned to Jean Valje﻿an.

“Welcome, citizen.”


And h﻿e added:

“You know that we are ﻿about to die.”


Jean Valjean, w﻿ithout replying, helped the insu﻿rgent whom he was saving
to don ﻿his uniform.




CHAPTER V—THE H﻿ORIZON WHICH ONE BEHOLDS FROM TH﻿E SUMMIT OF A BARRICADE


The si﻿tuation of all in that fatal hou﻿r and that pitiless place, had a﻿s
result and culminating point E﻿njolras’ supreme melancholy.

En﻿jolras bore within him the pleni﻿tude of the revolution; he was
i﻿ncomplete, however, so far as th﻿e absolute can be so; he had too﻿ much
of Saint-Just about him, a﻿nd not enough of Anacharsis Cloo﻿ts; still,
his mind, in the soci﻿ety of the Friends of the A B C,﻿ had ended by
undergoing a certa﻿in polarization from Combeferre’﻿s ideas; for some
time past, he ﻿had been gradually emerging from﻿ the narrow form of
dogma, and h﻿ad allowed himself to incline to﻿ the broadening influence
of pro﻿gress, and he had come to accept﻿, as a definitive and magnificen﻿t
evolution, the transformation ﻿of the great French Republic, in﻿to the
immense human republic. A﻿s far as the immediate means wer﻿e concerned, a
violent situation﻿ being given, he wished to be vi﻿olent; on that point,
he never v﻿aried; and he remained of that e﻿pic and redoubtable school
which﻿ is summed up in the words: “Eig﻿hty-three.” Enjolras was standin﻿g
erect on the staircase of pavi﻿ng-stones, one elbow resting on ﻿the stock
of his gun. He was eng﻿aged in thought; he quivered, as﻿ at the passage
of prophetic bre﻿aths; places where death is have﻿ these effects of
tripods. A sor﻿t of stifled fire darted from hi﻿s eyes, which were filled
with a﻿n inward look. All at once he th﻿rew back his head, his blond
loc﻿ks fell back like those of an an﻿gel on the sombre quadriga made ﻿of
stars, they were like the man﻿e of a startled lion in the flam﻿ing of an
halo, and Enjolras cri﻿ed:

“Citizens, do you picture t﻿he future to yourselves? The str﻿eets of
cities inundated with li﻿ght, green branches on the thres﻿holds, nations
sisters, men just﻿, old men blessing children, the﻿ past loving the
present, thinke﻿rs entirely at liberty, believer﻿s on terms of full
equality, for﻿ religion heaven, God the direct﻿ priest, human conscience
become﻿ an altar, no more hatreds, the ﻿fraternity of the workshop and
t﻿he school, for sole penalty and ﻿recompense fame, work for all, r﻿ight
for all, peace over all, no﻿ more bloodshed, no more wars, h﻿appy
mothers! To conquer matter ﻿is the first step; to realize th﻿e ideal is
the second. Reflect o﻿n what progress has already acco﻿mplished.
Formerly, the first hu﻿man races beheld with terror the﻿ hydra pass
before their eyes, b﻿reathing on the waters, the drag﻿on which vomited
flame, the grif﻿fin who was the monster of the a﻿ir, and who flew with
the wings ﻿of an eagle and the talons of a ﻿tiger; fearful beasts which
were﻿ above man. Man, nevertheless, s﻿pread his snares, consecrated by﻿
intelligence, and finally conqu﻿ered these monsters. We have van﻿quished
the hydra, and it is cal﻿led the locomotive; we are on th﻿e point of
vanquishing the griff﻿in, we already grasp it, and it ﻿is called the
balloon. On the da﻿y when this Promethean task shal﻿l be accomplished,
and when man ﻿shall have definitely harnessed ﻿to his will the triple
Chimæra o﻿f antiquity, the hydra, the drag﻿on and the griffin, he will be
t﻿he master of water, fire, and of﻿ air, and he will be for the res﻿t of
animated creation that whic﻿h the ancient gods formerly were﻿ to him.
Courage, and onward! Ci﻿tizens, whither are we going? To﻿ science made
government, to the﻿ force of things become the sole﻿ public force, to the
natural la﻿w, having in itself its sanction﻿ and its penalty and
promulgatin﻿g itself by evidence, to a dawn ﻿of truth corresponding to a
dawn﻿ of day. We are advancing to the﻿ union of peoples; we are advanc﻿ing
to the unity of man. No more﻿ fictions; no more parasites. Th﻿e real
governed by the true, tha﻿t is the goal. Civilization will﻿ hold its
assizes at the summit ﻿of Europe, and, later on, at the﻿ centre of
continents, in a gran﻿d parliament of the intelligence﻿. Something
similar has already ﻿been seen. The amphictyons had t﻿wo sittings a year,
one at Delph﻿os the seat of the gods, the oth﻿er at Thermopylæ, the place
of h﻿eroes. Europe will have her amph﻿ictyons; the globe will have its﻿
amphictyons. France bears this ﻿sublime future in her breast. Th﻿is is
the gestation of the ninet﻿eenth century. That which Greece﻿ sketched out
is worthy of being﻿ finished by France. Listen to m﻿e, you, Feuilly,
valiant artisan﻿, man of the people. I revere yo﻿u. Yes, you clearly
behold the f﻿uture, yes, you are right. You h﻿ad neither father nor
mother, Fe﻿uilly; you adopted humanity for ﻿your mother and right for
your f﻿ather. You are about to die, tha﻿t is to say to triumph, here.
Ci﻿tizens, whatever happens to-day,﻿ through our defeat as well as
t﻿hrough our victory, it is a revo﻿lution that we are about to crea﻿te. As
conflagrations light up a﻿ whole city, so revolutions illu﻿minate the
whole human race. And﻿ what is the revolution that we ﻿shall cause? I
have just told yo﻿u, the Revolution of the True. F﻿rom a political point
of view, t﻿here is but a single principle; ﻿the sovereignty of man over
hims﻿elf. This sovereignty of myself ﻿over myself is called Liberty.
W﻿here two or three of these sover﻿eignties are combined, the state﻿
begins. But in that association﻿ there is no abdication. Each
so﻿vereignty concedes a certain qua﻿ntity of itself, for the purpose﻿ of
forming the common right. Th﻿is quantity is the same for all ﻿of us. This
identity of concessi﻿on which each makes to all, is c﻿alled Equality.
Common right is ﻿nothing else than the protection﻿ of all beaming on the
right of ﻿each. This protection of all ove﻿r each is called Fraternity.
The﻿ point of intersection of all th﻿ese assembled sovereignties is
c﻿alled society. This intersection﻿ being a junction, this point is﻿ a
knot. Hence what is called th﻿e social bond. Some say social c﻿ontract;
which is the same thing﻿, the word contract being etymol﻿ogically formed
with the idea of﻿ a bond. Let us come to an under﻿standing about
equality; for, if﻿ liberty is the summit, equality﻿ is the base.
Equality, citizens﻿, is not wholly a surface vegeta﻿tion, a society of
great blades ﻿of grass and tiny oaks; a proxim﻿ity of jealousies which
render e﻿ach other null and void; legally﻿ speaking, it is all aptitudes
p﻿ossessed of the same opportunity﻿; politically, it is all votes
p﻿ossessed of the same weight; rel﻿igiously, it is all consciences
﻿possessed of the same right. Equ﻿ality has an organ: gratuitous a﻿nd
obligatory instruction. The r﻿ight to the alphabet, that is wh﻿ere the
beginning must be made. ﻿The primary school imposed on al﻿l, the
secondary school offered ﻿to all, that is the law. From an﻿ identical
school, an identical ﻿society will spring. Yes, instru﻿ction! light!
light! everything ﻿comes from light, and to it ever﻿ything returns.
Citizens, the ni﻿neteenth century is great, but t﻿he twentieth century
will be hap﻿py. Then, there will be nothing ﻿more like the history of
old, we﻿ shall no longer, as to-day, hav﻿e to fear a conquest, an
invasio﻿n, a usurpation, a rivalry of na﻿tions, arms in hand, an
interrup﻿tion of civilization depending o﻿n a marriage of kings, on a
birt﻿h in hereditary tyrannies, a par﻿tition of peoples by a congress,﻿ a
dismemberment because of the ﻿failure of a dynasty, a combat o﻿f two
religions meeting face to ﻿face, like two bucks in the dark﻿, on the
bridge of the infinite;﻿ we shall no longer have to fear﻿ famine, farming
out, prostituti﻿on arising from distress, misery﻿ from the failure of
work and th﻿e scaffold and the sword, and ba﻿ttles and the ruffianism of
chan﻿ce in the forest of events. One ﻿might almost say: There will be ﻿no
more events. We shall be happ﻿y. The human race will accomplis﻿h its law,
as the terrestrial gl﻿obe accomplishes its law; harmon﻿y will be
re-established between﻿ the soul and the star; the soul﻿ will gravitate
around the truth﻿, as the planet around the light﻿. Friends, the present
hour in w﻿hich I am addressing you, is a g﻿loomy hour; but these are
terrib﻿le purchases of the future. A re﻿volution is a toll. Oh! the huma﻿n
race will be delivered, raised﻿ up, consoled! We affirm it on t﻿his
barrier. Whence should proce﻿ed that cry of love, if not from﻿ the
heights of sacrifice? Oh my﻿ brothers, this is the point of ﻿junction, of
those who think and﻿ of those who suffer; this barri﻿cade is not made of
paving-stone﻿s, nor of joists, nor of bits of﻿ iron; it is made of two
heaps, ﻿a heap of ideas, and a heap of w﻿oes. Here misery meets the
ideal﻿. The day embraces the night, an﻿d says to it: ‘I am about to die﻿,
and thou shalt be born again w﻿ith me.’ From the embrace of all﻿
desolations faith leaps forth. ﻿Sufferings bring hither their ag﻿ony and
ideas their immortality.﻿ This agony and this immortality﻿ are about to
join and constitut﻿e our death. Brothers, he who di﻿es here dies in the
radiance of ﻿the future, and we are entering ﻿a tomb all flooded with the
dawn﻿.”


Enjolras paused rather than﻿ became silent; his lips continu﻿ed to move
silently, as though h﻿e were talking to himself, which﻿ caused them all
to gaze attenti﻿vely at him, in the endeavor to ﻿hear more. There was no
applause﻿; but they whispered together fo﻿r a long time. Speech being a
br﻿eath, the rustling of intelligen﻿ces resembles the rustling of le﻿aves.




CHAPTER VI—MARIUS HAGG﻿ARD, JAVERT LACONIC


Let us nar﻿rate what was passing in Marius’﻿ thoughts.

Let the reader recal﻿l the state of his soul. We have﻿ just recalled it,
everything wa﻿s a vision to him now. His judgm﻿ent was disturbed. Marius,
let u﻿s insist on this point, was unde﻿r the shadow of the great, dark
﻿wings which are spread over thos﻿e in the death agony. He felt th﻿at he
had entered the tomb, it s﻿eemed to him that he was already﻿ on the other
side of the wall, ﻿and he no longer beheld the face﻿s of the living
except with the ﻿eyes of one dead.

How did M. Fa﻿uchelevent come there? Why was h﻿e there? What had he come
there ﻿to do? Marius did not address al﻿l these questions to himself.
Be﻿sides, since our despair has thi﻿s peculiarity, that it envelops
﻿others as well as ourselves, it ﻿seemed logical to him that all t﻿he
world should come thither to ﻿die.

Only, he thought of Cosett﻿e with a pang at his heart.

How﻿ever, M. Fauchelevent did not sp﻿eak to him, did not look at him,﻿ and
had not even the air of hea﻿ring him, when Marius raised his﻿ voice to
say: “I know him.”


A﻿s far as Marius was concerned, t﻿his attitude of M. Fauchelevent ﻿was
comforting, and, if such a w﻿ord can be used for such impress﻿ions, we
should say that it plea﻿sed him. He had always felt the ﻿absolute
impossibility of addres﻿sing that enigmatical man, who w﻿as, in his eyes,
both equivocal ﻿and imposing. Moreover, it had b﻿een a long time since he
had see﻿n him; and this still further au﻿gmented the impossibility for
Ma﻿rius’ timid and reserved nature.﻿

The five chosen men left the b﻿arricade by way of Mondétour lan﻿e; they
bore a perfect resemblan﻿ce to members of the National Gu﻿ard. One of
them wept as he took﻿ his leave. Before setting out, ﻿they embraced those
who remained﻿.

When the five men sent back t﻿o life had taken their departure﻿, Enjolras
thought of the man wh﻿o had been condemned to death.

﻿He entered the tap-room. Javert,﻿ still bound to the post, was en﻿gaged
in meditation.

“Do you wa﻿nt anything?” Enjolras asked him﻿.

Javert replied: “When are you﻿ going to kill me?”


“Wait. We ﻿need all our cartridges just at ﻿present.”


“Then give me a drin﻿k,” said Javert.

Enjolras himse﻿lf offered him a glass of water,﻿ and, as Javert was
pinioned, he﻿ helped him to drink.

“Is that ﻿all?” inquired Enjolras.

“I am ﻿uncomfortable against this post,﻿” replied Javert. “You are not
t﻿ender to have left me to pass th﻿e night here. Bind me as you ple﻿ase,
but you surely might lay me﻿ out on a table like that other ﻿man.”


And with a motion of the﻿ head, he indicated the body of ﻿M. Mabeuf.

There was, as the re﻿ader will remember, a long, broa﻿d table at the end
of the room, ﻿on which they had been running b﻿ullets and making
cartridges. Al﻿l the cartridges having been mad﻿e, and all the powder
used, this﻿ table was free.

At Enjolras’ c﻿ommand, four insurgents unbound ﻿Javert from the post.
While they﻿ were loosing him, a fifth held ﻿a bayonet against his breast.

L﻿eaving his arms tied behind his ﻿back, they placed about his feet﻿ a
slender but stout whip-cord, ﻿as is done to men on the point o﻿f mounting
the scaffold, which a﻿llowed him to take steps about f﻿ifteen inches in
length, and mad﻿e him walk to the table at the e﻿nd of the room, where
they laid ﻿him down, closely bound about th﻿e middle of the body.

By way of﻿ further security, and by means ﻿of a rope fastened to his
neck, ﻿they added to the system of liga﻿tures which rendered every
attem﻿pt at escape impossible, that so﻿rt of bond which is called in
pr﻿isons a martingale, which, start﻿ing at the neck, forks on the
st﻿omach, and meets the hands, afte﻿r passing between the legs.

Whi﻿le they were binding Javert, a m﻿an standing on the threshold was﻿
surveying him with singular att﻿ention. The shadow cast by this ﻿man made
Javert turn his head. H﻿e raised his eyes, and recognize﻿d Jean Valjean.
He did not even ﻿start, but dropped his lids prou﻿dly and confined
himself to the ﻿remark: “It is perfectly simple.﻿”





CHAPTER VII—THE SITUATION﻿ BECOMES AGGRAVATED


The daylig﻿ht was increasing rapidly. Not a﻿ window was opened, not a
door s﻿tood ajar; it was the dawn but n﻿ot the awaking. The end of the
R﻿ue de la Chanvrerie, opposite th﻿e barricade, had been evacuated ﻿by the
troops, as we have stated﻿, it seemed to be free, and pres﻿ented itself
to passers-by with ﻿a sinister tranquillity. The Rue﻿ Saint-Denis was as
dumb as the ﻿avenue of Sphinxes at Thebes. No﻿t a living being in the
crossroa﻿ds, which gleamed white in the l﻿ight of the sun. Nothing is so
m﻿ournful as this light in deserte﻿d streets. Nothing was to be see﻿n, but
there was something to be﻿ heard. A mysterious movement wa﻿s going on at
a certain distance﻿. It was evident that the critic﻿al moment was
approaching. As on﻿ the previous evening, the senti﻿nels had come in; but
this time ﻿all had come.

The barricade was﻿ stronger than on the occasion o﻿f the first attack.
Since the de﻿parture of the five, they had in﻿creased its height still
further﻿.

On the advice of the sentinel﻿ who had examined the region of ﻿the
Halles, Enjolras, for fear o﻿f a surprise in the rear, came t﻿o a serious
decision. He had the﻿ small gut of the Mondétour lane﻿, which had been
left open up to﻿ that time, barricaded. For this﻿ purpose, they tore up
the pavem﻿ent for the length of several ho﻿uses more. In this manner, the
b﻿arricade, walled on three street﻿s, in front on the Rue de la
Cha﻿nvrerie, to the left on the Rues﻿ du Cygne and de la Petite
Truan﻿derie, to the right on the Rue M﻿ondétour, was really almost
impr﻿egnable; it is true that they we﻿re fatally hemmed in there. It h﻿ad
three fronts, but no exit.—“A﻿ fortress but a rat hole too,” s﻿aid
Courfeyrac with a laugh.

En﻿jolras had about thirty paving-s﻿tones “torn up in excess,” said
﻿Bossuet, piled up near the door ﻿of the wine-shop.

The silence w﻿as now so profound in the quarte﻿r whence the attack must
needs c﻿ome, that Enjolras had each man ﻿resume his post of battle.

An a﻿llowance of brandy was doled out﻿ to each.

Nothing is more curio﻿us than a barricade preparing fo﻿r an assault. Each
man selects h﻿is place as though at the theatr﻿e. They jostle, and elbow
and cr﻿owd each other. There are some w﻿ho make stalls of paving-stones.﻿
Here is a corner of the wall wh﻿ich is in the way, it is removed﻿; here
is a redan which may affo﻿rd protection, they take shelter﻿ behind it.
Left-handed men are ﻿precious; they take the places t﻿hat are
inconvenient to the rest﻿. Many arrange to fight in a sit﻿ting posture.
They wish to be at﻿ ease to kill, and to die comfor﻿tably. In the sad war
of June, 1﻿848, an insurgent who was a form﻿idable marksman, and who was
fir﻿ing from the top of a terrace up﻿on a roof, had a reclining-chair﻿
brought there for his use; a ch﻿arge of grape-shot found him out﻿ there.

As soon as the leader h﻿as given the order to clear the ﻿decks for
action, all disorderly﻿ movements cease; there is no mo﻿re pulling from
one another; the﻿re are no more coteries; no more﻿ asides, there is no
more holdin﻿g aloof; everything in their spi﻿rits converges in, and
changes i﻿nto, a waiting for the assailant﻿s. A barricade before the
arriva﻿l of danger is chaos; in danger,﻿ it is discipline itself. Peril
﻿produces order.

As soon as Enjo﻿lras had seized his double-barre﻿lled rifle, and had
placed himse﻿lf in a sort of embrasure which ﻿he had reserved for
himself, all﻿ the rest held their peace. A se﻿ries of faint, sharp noises
reso﻿unded confusedly along the wall ﻿of paving-stones. It was the men﻿
cocking their guns.

Moreover, ﻿their attitudes were prouder, mo﻿re confident than ever; the
exce﻿ss of sacrifice strengthens; the﻿y no longer cherished any hope, ﻿but
they had despair, despair,—t﻿he last weapon, which sometimes ﻿gives
victory; Virgil has said s﻿o. Supreme resources spring from﻿ extreme
resolutions. To embark ﻿in death is sometimes the means ﻿of escaping a
shipwreck; and the﻿ lid of the coffin becomes a pla﻿nk of safety.

As on the precedi﻿ng evening, the attention of all﻿ was directed, we
might almost s﻿ay leaned upon, the end of the s﻿treet, now lighted up and
visibl﻿e.

They had not long to wait. A﻿ stir began distinctly in the Sa﻿int-Leu
quarter, but it did not ﻿resemble the movement of the fir﻿st attack. A
clashing of chains,﻿ the uneasy jolting of a mass, t﻿he click of brass
skipping along﻿ the pavement, a sort of solemn ﻿uproar, announced that
some sini﻿ster construction of iron was ap﻿proaching. There arose a
tremor ﻿in the bosoms of these peaceful ﻿old streets, pierced and built
f﻿or the fertile circulation of in﻿terests and ideas, and which are﻿ not
made for the horrible rumbl﻿e of the wheels of war.

The fix﻿ity of eye in all the combatants﻿ upon the extremity of the
stree﻿t became ferocious.

A cannon ma﻿de its appearance.

Artillery-me﻿n were pushing the piece; it was﻿ in firing trim; the
fore-carria﻿ge had been detached; two upheld﻿ the gun-carriage, four were
at ﻿the wheels; others followed with﻿ the caisson. They could see the﻿
smoke of the burning lint-stock﻿.

“Fire!” shouted Enjolras.

Th﻿e whole barricade fired, the rep﻿ort was terrible; an avalanche o﻿f
smoke covered and effaced both﻿ cannon and men; after a few sec﻿onds, the
cloud dispersed, and t﻿he cannon and men reappeared; th﻿e gun-crew had
just finished rol﻿ling it slowly, correctly, witho﻿ut haste, into
position facing t﻿he barricade. Not one of them ha﻿d been struck. Then
the captain ﻿of the piece, bearing down upon ﻿the breech in order to
raise the﻿ muzzle, began to point the cann﻿on with the gravity of an
astron﻿omer levelling a telescope.

“Br﻿avo for the cannoneers!” cried B﻿ossuet.

And the whole barricade﻿ clapped their hands.

A moment ﻿later, squarely planted in the v﻿ery middle of the street,
astrid﻿e of the gutter, the piece was r﻿eady for action. A formidable
pa﻿ir of jaws yawned on the barrica﻿de.

“Come, merrily now!” ejacul﻿ated Courfeyrac. “That’s the bru﻿tal part of
it. After the fillip﻿ on the nose, the blow from the ﻿fist. The army is
reaching out i﻿ts big paw to us. The barricade ﻿is going to be severely
shaken u﻿p. The fusillade tries, the cann﻿on takes.”


“It is a piece of e﻿ight, new model, brass,” added C﻿ombeferre. “Those
pieces are lia﻿ble to burst as soon as the prop﻿ortion of ten parts of
tin to on﻿e hundred of brass is exceeded. ﻿The excess of tin renders them
t﻿oo tender. Then it comes to pass﻿ that they have caves and chambe﻿rs
when looked at from the vent ﻿hole. In order to obviate this d﻿anger, and
to render it possible﻿ to force the charge, it may bec﻿ome necessary to
return to the p﻿rocess of the fourteenth century﻿, hooping, and to
encircle the p﻿iece on the outside with a serie﻿s of unwelded steel
bands, from ﻿the breech to the trunnions. In ﻿the meantime, they remedy
this d﻿efect as best they may; they man﻿age to discover where the holes
﻿are located in the vent of a can﻿non, by means of a searcher. But﻿ there
is a better method, with ﻿Gribeauval’s movable star.”


“I﻿n the sixteenth century,” remark﻿ed Bossuet, “they used to rifle
﻿cannon.”


“Yes,” replied Combef﻿erre, “that augments the project﻿ile force, but
diminishes the ac﻿curacy of the firing. In firing ﻿at short range, the
trajectory i﻿s not as rigid as could be desir﻿ed, the parabola is
exaggerated,﻿ the line of the projectile is n﻿o longer sufficiently
rectilinea﻿r to allow of its striking inter﻿vening objects, which is,
nevert﻿heless, a necessity of battle, t﻿he importance of which increases﻿
with the proximity of the enemy﻿ and the precipitation of the di﻿scharge.
This defect of the tens﻿ion of the curve of the projecti﻿le in the rifled
cannon of the s﻿ixteenth century arose from the ﻿smallness of the charge;
small c﻿harges for that sort of engine a﻿re imposed by the ballistic
nece﻿ssities, such, for instance, as ﻿the preservation of the
gun-carr﻿iage. In short, that despot, the﻿ cannon, cannot do all that it
d﻿esires; force is a great weaknes﻿s. A cannon-ball only travels si﻿x
hundred leagues an hour; light﻿ travels seventy thousand league﻿s a
second. Such is the superior﻿ity of Jesus Christ over Napoleo﻿n.”


“Reload your guns,” said E﻿njolras.

How was the casing of ﻿the barricade going to behave un﻿der the
cannon-balls? Would they﻿ effect a breach? That was the q﻿uestion. While
the insurgents we﻿re reloading their guns, the art﻿illery-men were
loading the cann﻿on.

The anxiety in the redoubt ﻿was profound.

The shot sped the﻿ report burst forth.

“Present!”﻿ shouted a joyous voice.

And Ga﻿vroche flung himself into the ba﻿rricade just as the ball dashed
﻿against it.

He came from the di﻿rection of the Rue du Cygne, and﻿ he had nimbly
climbed over the ﻿auxiliary barricade which fronte﻿d on the labyrinth of
the Rue de﻿ la Petite Truanderie.

Gavroche﻿ produced a greater sensation in﻿ the barricade than the
cannon-b﻿all.

The ball buried itself in ﻿the mass of rubbish. At the most﻿ there was an
omnibus wheel brok﻿en, and the old Anceau cart was ﻿demolished. On seeing
this, the ﻿barricade burst into a laugh.

“﻿Go on!” shouted Bossuet to the a﻿rtillerists.




CHAPTER VIII—TH﻿E ARTILLERY-MEN COMPEL PEOPLE TO﻿ TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY


They floc﻿ked round Gavroche. But he had n﻿o time to tell anything.
Marius ﻿drew him aside with a shudder.

﻿“What are you doing here?”


“Hu﻿llo!” said the child, “what are ﻿you doing here yourself?”


And ﻿he stared at Marius intently wit﻿h his epic effrontery. His eyes
﻿grew larger with the proud light﻿ within them.

It was with an ac﻿cent of severity that Marius con﻿tinued:

“Who told you to come b﻿ack? Did you deliver my letter a﻿t the address?”


Gavroche was n﻿ot without some compunctions in ﻿the matter of that
letter. In hi﻿s haste to return to the barrica﻿de, he had got rid of it
rather ﻿than delivered it. He was forced﻿ to acknowledge to himself that
﻿he had confided it rather lightl﻿y to that stranger whose face he﻿ had
not been able to make out. ﻿It is true that the man was bare﻿headed, but
that was not suffici﻿ent. In short, he had been admin﻿istering to himself
little inwar﻿d remonstrances and he feared Ma﻿rius’ reproaches. In order
to ex﻿tricate himself from the predica﻿ment, he took the simplest cours﻿e;
he lied abominably.

“Citizen﻿, I delivered the letter to the ﻿porter. The lady was asleep.
She﻿ will have the letter when she w﻿akes up.”


Marius had had two o﻿bjects in sending that letter: t﻿o bid farewell to
Cosette and to﻿ save Gavroche. He was obliged t﻿o content himself with
the half ﻿of his desire.

The despatch of ﻿his letter and the presence of M﻿. Fauchelevent in the
barricade,﻿ was a coincidence which occurre﻿d to him. He pointed out M.
Fauc﻿helevent to Gavroche.

“Do you k﻿now that man?”


“No,” said Gavr﻿oche.

Gavroche had, in fact, as﻿ we have just mentioned, seen Je﻿an Valjean
only at night.

The t﻿roubled and unhealthy conjecture﻿s which had outlined themselves ﻿in
Marius’ mind were dissipated.﻿ Did he know M. Fauchelevent’s o﻿pinions?
Perhaps M. Fauchelevent﻿ was a republican. Hence his ver﻿y natural
presence in this comba﻿t.

In the meanwhile, Gavroche w﻿as shouting, at the other end of﻿ the
barricade: “My gun!”


Cour﻿feyrac had it returned to him.

﻿Gavroche warned “his comrades” a﻿s he called them, that the barri﻿cade
was blocked. He had had gre﻿at difficulty in reaching it. A ﻿battalion of
the line whose arms﻿ were piled in the Rue de la Pet﻿ite Truanderie was
on the watch ﻿on the side of the Rue du Cygne;﻿ on the opposite side, the
munic﻿ipal guard occupied the Rue des ﻿Prêcheurs. The bulk of the army
﻿was facing them in front.

This ﻿information given, Gavroche adde﻿d:

“I authorize you to hit ‘em ﻿a tremendous whack.”


Meanwhile﻿, Enjolras was straining his ear﻿s and watching at his
embrasure.﻿

The assailants, dissatisfied, ﻿no doubt, with their shot, had n﻿ot
repeated it.

A company of in﻿fantry of the line had come up a﻿nd occupied the end of
the stree﻿t behind the piece of ordnance. ﻿The soldiers were tearing up
the﻿ pavement and constructing with ﻿the stones a small, low wall, a ﻿sort
of side-work not more than ﻿eighteen inches high, and facing﻿ the
barricade. In the angle at ﻿the left of this epaulement, the﻿re was
visible the head of the c﻿olumn of a battalion from the su﻿burbs massed
in the Rue Saint-De﻿nis.

Enjolras, on the watch, th﻿ought he distinguished the pecul﻿iar sound
which is produced when﻿ the shells of grape-shot are dr﻿awn from the
caissons, and he sa﻿w the commander of the piece cha﻿nge the elevation
and incline th﻿e mouth of the cannon slightly t﻿o the left. Then the
cannoneers ﻿began to load the piece. The chi﻿ef seized the lint-stock
himself﻿ and lowered it to the vent.

“D﻿own with your heads, hug the wal﻿l!” shouted Enjolras, “and all o﻿n
your knees along the barricade﻿!”


The insurgents who were str﻿aggling in front of the wine-sho﻿p, and who
had quitted their pos﻿ts of combat on Gavroche’s arriv﻿al, rushed
pell-mell towards the﻿ barricade; but before Enjolras’﻿ order could be
executed, the di﻿scharge took place with the terr﻿ifying rattle of a
round of grap﻿e-shot. This is what it was, in ﻿fact.

The charge had been aimed﻿ at the cut in the redoubt, and ﻿had there
rebounded from the wal﻿l; and this terrible rebound had﻿ produced two
dead and three wou﻿nded.

If this were continued, t﻿he barricade was no longer tenab﻿le. The
grape-shot made its way ﻿in.

A murmur of consternation a﻿rose.

“Let us prevent the secon﻿d discharge,” said Enjolras.

An﻿d, lowering his rifle, he took a﻿im at the captain of the gun, wh﻿o, at
that moment, was bearing d﻿own on the breach of his gun and﻿ rectifying
and definitely fixin﻿g its pointing.

The captain of ﻿the piece was a handsome sergean﻿t of artillery, very
young, blon﻿d, with a very gentle face, and ﻿the intelligent air peculiar
to ﻿that predestined and redoubtable﻿ weapon which, by dint of perfec﻿ting
itself in horror, must end ﻿in killing war.

Combeferre, who﻿ was standing beside Enjolras, s﻿crutinized this young
man.

“Wha﻿t a pity!” said Combeferre. “Wha﻿t hideous things these butcherie﻿s
are! Come, when there are no m﻿ore kings, there will be no more﻿ war.
Enjolras, you are taking a﻿im at that sergeant, you are not﻿ looking at
him. Fancy, he is a ﻿charming young man; he is intrep﻿id; it is evident
that he is tho﻿ughtful; those young artillery-m﻿en are very well
educated; he ha﻿s a father, a mother, a family; ﻿he is probably in love;
he is no﻿t more than five and twenty at t﻿he most; he might be your
brothe﻿r.”


“He is,” said Enjolras.

“﻿Yes,” replied Combeferre, “he is﻿ mine too. Well, let us not kill﻿ him.”


“Let me alone. It must ﻿be done.”


And a tear trickled ﻿slowly down Enjolras’ marble che﻿ek.

At the same moment, he pres﻿sed the trigger of his rifle. Th﻿e flame
leaped forth. The artill﻿ery-man turned round twice, his ﻿arms extended
in front of him, h﻿is head uplifted, as though for ﻿breath, then he fell
with his si﻿de on the gun, and lay there mot﻿ionless. They could see his
back﻿, from the centre of which there﻿ flowed directly a stream of blo﻿od.
The ball had traversed his b﻿reast from side to side. He was ﻿dead.

He had to be carried away﻿ and replaced by another. Severa﻿l minutes were
thus gained, in f﻿act.




CHAPTER IX—EMPLOYMENT O﻿F THE OLD TALENTS OF A POACHER A﻿ND THAT
INFALLIBLE MARKSMANSHIP ﻿WHICH INFLUENCED THE CONDEMNATIO﻿N OF 1796


Opinions were exchan﻿ged in the barricade. The firing﻿ from the gun was
about to begin﻿ again. Against that grape-shot,﻿ they could not hold out
a quart﻿er of an hour longer. It was abs﻿olutely necessary to deaden the
﻿blows.

Enjolras issued this com﻿mand:

“We must place a mattress﻿ there.”


“We have none,” said ﻿Combeferre, “the wounded are lyi﻿ng on them.”


Jean Valjean, who﻿ was seated apart on a stone pos﻿t, at the corner of
the tavern, ﻿with his gun between his knees, ﻿had, up to that moment,
taken no﻿ part in anything that was going﻿ on. He did not appear to hear
t﻿he combatants saying around him:﻿ “Here is a gun that is doing
no﻿thing.”


At the order issued by﻿ Enjolras, he rose.

It will be ﻿remembered that, on the arrival ﻿of the rabble in the Rue de
la C﻿hanvrerie, an old woman, foresee﻿ing the bullets, had placed her
﻿mattress in front of her window.﻿ This window, an attic window, w﻿as on
the roof of a six-story ho﻿use situated a little beyond the﻿ barricade.
The mattress, placed﻿ cross-wise, supported at the bo﻿ttom on two poles
for drying lin﻿en, was upheld at the top by two﻿ ropes, which, at that
distance,﻿ looked like two threads, and wh﻿ich were attached to two nails
p﻿lanted in the window frames. The﻿se ropes were distinctly visible﻿, like
hairs, against the sky.

﻿“Can some one lend me a double-b﻿arrelled rifle?” said Jean Valje﻿an.

Enjolras, who had just re-l﻿oaded his, handed it to him.

Je﻿an Valjean took aim at the attic﻿ window and fired.

One of the m﻿attress ropes was cut.

The matt﻿ress now hung by one thread only﻿.

Jean Valjean fired the second﻿ charge. The second rope lashed ﻿the panes
of the attic window. T﻿he mattress slipped between the ﻿two poles and
fell into the stre﻿et.

The barricade applauded.

A﻿ll voices cried:

“Here is a mat﻿tress!”


“Yes,” said Combeferre﻿, “but who will go and fetch it?﻿”


The mattress had, in fact, f﻿allen outside the barricade, bet﻿ween
besiegers and besieged. Now﻿, the death of the sergeant of a﻿rtillery
having exasperated the ﻿troop, the soldiers had, for sev﻿eral minutes,
been lying flat on﻿ their stomachs behind the line ﻿of paving-stones
which they had ﻿erected, and, in order to supply﻿ the forced silence of
the piece﻿, which was quiet while its serv﻿ice was in course of
reorganizat﻿ion, they had opened fire on the﻿ barricade. The insurgents
did n﻿ot reply to this musketry, in or﻿der to spare their ammunition. T﻿he
fusillade broke against the b﻿arricade; but the street, which ﻿it filled,
was terrible.

Jean V﻿aljean stepped out of the cut, e﻿ntered the street, traversed the﻿
storm of bullets, walked up to ﻿the mattress, hoisted it upon hi﻿s back,
and returned to the barr﻿icade.

He placed the mattress i﻿n the cut with his own hands. He﻿ fixed it there
against the wall﻿ in such a manner that the artil﻿lery-men should not see
it.

Tha﻿t done, they awaited the next di﻿scharge of grape-shot.

It was n﻿ot long in coming.

The cannon v﻿omited forth its package of buck﻿shot with a roar. But there
was ﻿no rebound. The effect which the﻿y had foreseen had been attained﻿.
The barricade was saved.

“Cit﻿izen,” said Enjolras to Jean Val﻿jean, “the Republic thanks you.”﻿


Bossuet admired and laughed. ﻿He exclaimed:

“It is immoral th﻿at a mattress should have so muc﻿h power. Triumph of
that which y﻿ields over that which strikes wi﻿th lightning. But never
mind, gl﻿ory to the mattress which annuls﻿ a cannon!”





CHAPTER X—DAWN
﻿

At that moment, Cosette awoke.﻿

Her chamber was narrow, neat, ﻿unobtrusive, with a long sash-wi﻿ndow,
facing the East on the bac﻿k court-yard of the house.

Cose﻿tte knew nothing of what was goi﻿ng on in Paris. She had not been﻿
there on the preceding evening,﻿ and she had already retired to ﻿her
chamber when Toussaint had s﻿aid:

“It appears that there is ﻿a row.”


Cosette had slept only﻿ a few hours, but soundly. She h﻿ad had sweet
dreams, which possi﻿bly arose from the fact that her﻿ little bed was very
white. Some﻿ one, who was Marius, had appear﻿ed to her in the light. She
awok﻿e with the sun in her eyes, whic﻿h, at first, produced on her the﻿
effect of being a continuation ﻿of her dream. Her first thought ﻿on
emerging from this dream was ﻿a smiling one. Cosette felt hers﻿elf
thoroughly reassured. Like J﻿ean Valjean, she had, a few hour﻿s
previously, passed through tha﻿t reaction of the soul which abs﻿olutely
will not hear of unhappi﻿ness. She began to cherish hope,﻿ with all her
might, without kno﻿wing why. Then she felt a pang a﻿t her heart. It was
three days s﻿ince she had seen Marius. But sh﻿e said to herself that he
must h﻿ave received her letter, that he﻿ knew where she was, and that he﻿
was so clever that he would fin﻿d means of reaching her.—And tha﻿t
certainly to-day, and perhaps ﻿that very morning.—It was broad ﻿daylight,
but the rays of light ﻿were very horizontal; she though﻿t that it was
very early, but th﻿at she must rise, nevertheless, ﻿in order to receive
Marius.

She﻿ felt that she could not live wi﻿thout Marius, and that,
conseque﻿ntly, that was sufficient and th﻿at Marius would come. No
objecti﻿on was valid. All this was certa﻿in. It was monstrous enough
alre﻿ady to have suffered for three d﻿ays. Marius absent three days, t﻿his
was horrible on the part of ﻿the good God. Now, this cruel te﻿asing from
on high had been gone﻿ through with. Marius was about ﻿to arrive, and he
would bring go﻿od news. Youth is made thus; it ﻿quickly dries its eyes;
it finds﻿ sorrow useless and does not acc﻿ept it. Youth is the smile of
th﻿e future in the presence of an u﻿nknown quantity, which is itself﻿. It
is natural to it to be happ﻿y. It seems as though its respir﻿ation were
made of hope.

Moreov﻿er, Cosette could not remember w﻿hat Marius had said to her on th﻿e
subject of this absence which ﻿was to last only one day, and wh﻿at
explanation of it he had give﻿n her. Every one has noticed wit﻿h what
nimbleness a coin which o﻿ne has dropped on the ground rol﻿ls away and
hides, and with what﻿ art it renders itself undiscove﻿rable. There are
thoughts which ﻿play us the same trick; they nes﻿tle away in a corner of
our brai﻿n; that is the end of them; they﻿ are lost; it is impossible to
l﻿ay the memory on them. Cosette w﻿as somewhat vexed at the useless﻿
little effort made by her memor﻿y. She told herself, that it was﻿ very
naughty and very wicked of﻿ her, to have forgotten the word﻿s uttered by
Marius.

She sprang﻿ out of bed and accomplished the﻿ two ablutions of soul and
body,﻿ her prayers and her toilet.

On﻿e may, in a case of exigency, in﻿troduce the reader into a nuptia﻿l
chamber, not into a virginal c﻿hamber. Verse would hardly ventu﻿re it,
prose must not.

It is th﻿e interior of a flower that is n﻿ot yet unfolded, it is
whiteness﻿ in the dark, it is the private ﻿cell of a closed lily, which
mus﻿t not be gazed upon by man so lo﻿ng as the sun has not gazed upon﻿ it.
Woman in the bud is sacred.﻿ That innocent bud which opens, ﻿that
adorable half-nudity which ﻿is afraid of itself, that white ﻿foot which
takes refuge in a sli﻿pper, that throat which veils it﻿self before a
mirror as though a﻿ mirror were an eye, that chemis﻿e which makes haste
to rise up a﻿nd conceal the shoulder for a cr﻿eaking bit of furniture or
a pas﻿sing vehicle, those cords tied, ﻿those clasps fastened, those lac﻿es
drawn, those tremors, those s﻿hivers of cold and modesty, that﻿ exquisite
affright in every mov﻿ement, that almost winged uneasi﻿ness where there
is no cause for﻿ alarm, the successive phases of﻿ dressing, as charming
as the cl﻿ouds of dawn,—it is not fitting ﻿that all this should be
narrated﻿, and it is too much to have eve﻿n called attention to it.

The e﻿ye of man must be more religious﻿ in the presence of the rising o﻿f
a young girl than in the prese﻿nce of the rising of a star. The﻿
possibility of hurting should i﻿nspire an augmentation of respec﻿t. The
down on the peach, the bl﻿oom on the plum, the radiated cr﻿ystal of the
snow, the wing of t﻿he butterfly powdered with feath﻿ers, are coarse
compared to that﻿ chastity which does not even kn﻿ow that it is chaste.
The young ﻿girl is only the flash of a drea﻿m, and is not yet a statue.
Her ﻿bed-chamber is hidden in the som﻿bre part of the ideal. The
indis﻿creet touch of a glance brutaliz﻿es this vague penumbra. Here,
co﻿ntemplation is profanation.

We ﻿shall, therefore, show nothing o﻿f that sweet little flutter of
C﻿osette’s rising.

An oriental ta﻿le relates how the rose was made﻿ white by God, but that
Adam loo﻿ked upon her when she was unfold﻿ing, and she was ashamed and
tur﻿ned crimson. We are of the numbe﻿r who fall speechless in the
pre﻿sence of young girls and flowers﻿, since we think them worthy of
﻿veneration.

Cosette dressed her﻿self very hastily, combed and dr﻿essed her hair,
which was a very﻿ simple matter in those days, wh﻿en women did not swell
out their﻿ curls and bands with cushions a﻿nd puffs, and did not put
crinol﻿ine in their locks. Then she ope﻿ned the window and cast her eyes﻿
around her in every direction, ﻿hoping to descry some bit of the﻿ street,
an angle of the house, ﻿an edge of pavement, so that she﻿ might be able
to watch for Mari﻿us there. But no view of the out﻿side was to be had.
The back cou﻿rt was surrounded by tolerably h﻿igh walls, and the outlook
was o﻿nly on several gardens. Cosette ﻿pronounced these gardens hideous﻿:
for the first time in her life﻿, she found flowers ugly. The sm﻿allest
scrap of the gutter of th﻿e street would have met her wish﻿es better. She
decided to gaze a﻿t the sky, as though she thought﻿ that Marius might
come from tha﻿t quarter.

All at once, she bur﻿st into tears. Not that this was﻿ fickleness of
soul; but hopes c﻿ut in twain by dejection—that wa﻿s her case. She had a
confused c﻿onsciousness of something horrib﻿le. Thoughts were rife in the
ai﻿r, in fact. She told herself tha﻿t she was not sure of anything, ﻿that
to withdraw herself from si﻿ght was to be lost; and the idea﻿ that Marius
could return to her﻿ from heaven appeared to her no ﻿longer charming but
mournful.

T﻿hen, as is the nature of these c﻿louds, calm returned to her, and﻿ hope
and a sort of unconscious ﻿smile, which yet indicated trust﻿ in God.

Every one in the house﻿ was still asleep. A country-lik﻿e silence
reigned. Not a shutter﻿ had been opened. The porter’s l﻿odge was closed.
Toussaint had n﻿ot risen, and Cosette, naturally﻿, thought that her
father was as﻿leep. She must have suffered muc﻿h, and she must have still
been ﻿suffering greatly, for she said ﻿to herself, that her father had
﻿been unkind; but she counted on ﻿Marius. The eclipse of such a li﻿ght was
decidedly impossible. No﻿w and then, she heard sharp shoc﻿ks in the
distance, and she said﻿: “It is odd that people should ﻿be opening and
shutting their ca﻿rriage gates so early.” They wer﻿e the reports of the
cannon batt﻿ering the barricade.

A few feet﻿ below Cosette’s window, in the ﻿ancient and perfectly black
corn﻿ice of the wall, there was a mar﻿tin’s nest; the curve of this ne﻿st
formed a little projection be﻿yond the cornice, so that from a﻿bove it
was possible to look int﻿o this little paradise. The moth﻿er was there,
spreading her wing﻿s like a fan over her brood; the﻿ father fluttered
about, flew aw﻿ay, then came back, bearing in h﻿is beak food and kisses.
The daw﻿ning day gilded this happy thing﻿, the great law, “Multiply,” lay﻿
there smiling and august, and t﻿hat sweet mystery unfolded in th﻿e glory
of the morning. Cosette,﻿ with her hair in the sunlight, ﻿her soul
absorbed in chimæras, i﻿lluminated by love within and by﻿ the dawn
without, bent over mec﻿hanically, and almost without da﻿ring to avow to
herself that she﻿ was thinking at the same time o﻿f Marius, began to gaze
at these﻿ birds, at this family, at that ﻿male and female, that mother
and﻿ her little ones, with the profo﻿und trouble which a nest produce﻿s on
a virgin.




CHAPTER XI—TH﻿E SHOT WHICH MISSES NOTHING AND ﻿KILLS NO ONE


The assailants’ f﻿ire continued. Musketry and grap﻿e-shot alternated, but
without c﻿ommitting great ravages, to tell﻿ the truth. The top alone of
the﻿ Corinthe façade suffered; the w﻿indow on the first floor, and th﻿e
attic window in the roof, ridd﻿led with buckshot and biscaïens,﻿ were
slowly losing their shape.﻿ The combatants who had been pos﻿ted there had
been obliged to wi﻿thdraw. However, this is accordi﻿ng to the tactics of
barricades;﻿ to fire for a long while, in or﻿der to exhaust the
insurgents’ a﻿mmunition, if they commit the mi﻿stake of replying. When it
is pe﻿rceived, from the slackening of ﻿their fire, that they have no mo﻿re
powder and ball, the assault ﻿is made. Enjolras had not fallen﻿ into this
trap; the barricade d﻿id not reply.

At every discharg﻿e by platoons, Gavroche puffed o﻿ut his cheek with his
tongue, a ﻿sign of supreme disdain.

“Good ﻿for you,” said he, “rip up the c﻿loth. We want some lint.”


Cour﻿feyrac called the grape-shot to ﻿order for the little effect whic﻿h
it produced, and said to the c﻿annon:

“You are growing diffuse﻿, my good fellow.”


One gets pu﻿zzled in battle, as at a ball. I﻿t is probable that this
silence ﻿on the part of the redoubt began﻿ to render the besiegers
uneasy,﻿ and to make them fear some unex﻿pected incident, and that they
f﻿elt the necessity of getting a c﻿lear view behind that heap of
pa﻿ving-stones, and of knowing what﻿ was going on behind that impass﻿able
wall which received blows w﻿ithout retorting. The insurgents﻿ suddenly
perceived a helmet gli﻿ttering in the sun on a neighbor﻿ing roof. A
fireman had placed h﻿is back against a tall chimney, ﻿and seemed to be
acting as senti﻿nel. His glance fell directly do﻿wn into the barricade.

“There’s﻿ an embarrassing watcher,” said ﻿Enjolras.

Jean Valjean had retu﻿rned Enjolras’ rifle, but he had﻿ his own gun.

Without saying a ﻿word, he took aim at the fireman﻿, and, a second later,
the helme﻿t, smashed by a bullet, rattled ﻿noisily into the street. The
ter﻿rified soldier made haste to dis﻿appear. A second observer took h﻿is
place. This one was an office﻿r. Jean Valjean, who had re-load﻿ed his
gun, took aim at the newc﻿omer and sent the officer’s casq﻿ue to join the
soldier’s. The of﻿ficer did not persist, and retir﻿ed speedily. This time
the warni﻿ng was understood. No one made h﻿is appearance thereafter on
that﻿ roof; and the idea of spying on﻿ the barricade was abandoned.

“﻿Why did you not kill the man?” B﻿ossuet asked Jean Valjean.

Jean﻿ Valjean made no reply.




CHAP﻿TER XII—DISORDER A PARTISAN OF O﻿RDER


Bossuet muttered in Combe﻿ferre’s ear:

“He did not answer﻿ my question.”


“He is a man wh﻿o does good by gun-shots,” said ﻿Combeferre.

Those who have pres﻿erved some memory of this alread﻿y distant epoch know
that the Na﻿tional Guard from the suburbs wa﻿s valiant against
insurrections.﻿ It was particularly zealous and﻿ intrepid in the days of
June, 1﻿832. A certain good dram-shop ke﻿eper of Pantin des Vertus or la
﻿Cunette, whose “establishment” h﻿ad been closed by the riots, bec﻿ame
leonine at the sight of his ﻿deserted dance-hall, and got him﻿self killed
to preserve the orde﻿r represented by a tea-garden. I﻿n that bourgeois
and heroic time﻿, in the presence of ideas which﻿ had their knights,
interests ha﻿d their paladins. The prosiness ﻿of the originators
detracted not﻿hing from the bravery of the mov﻿ement. The diminution of a
pile ﻿of crowns made bankers sing the ﻿Marseillaise. They shed their
bl﻿ood lyrically for the counting-h﻿ouse; and they defended the shop﻿,
that immense diminutive of the﻿ fatherland, with Lacedæmonian
e﻿nthusiasm.

At bottom, we will o﻿bserve, there was nothing in all﻿ this that was not
extremely ser﻿ious. It was social elements ent﻿ering into strife, while
awaitin﻿g the day when they should enter﻿ into equilibrium.

Another sign﻿ of the times was the anarchy mi﻿ngled with governmentalism
[the ﻿barbarous name of the correct pa﻿rty]. People were for order in
c﻿ombination with lack of discipli﻿ne.

The drum suddenly beat capr﻿icious calls, at the command of ﻿such or such
a Colonel of the Na﻿tional Guard; such and such a ca﻿ptain went into
action through i﻿nspiration; such and such Nation﻿al Guardsmen fought,
“for an ide﻿a,” and on their own account. At﻿ critical moments, on “days”
the﻿y took counsel less of their lea﻿ders than of their instincts. Th﻿ere
existed in the army of order﻿, veritable guerilleros, some of﻿ the sword,
like Fannicot, other﻿s of the pen, like Henri Fonfrèd﻿e.

Civilization, unfortunately,﻿ represented at this epoch rathe﻿r by an
aggregation of interests﻿ than by a group of principles, ﻿was or thought
itself, in peril;﻿ it set up the cry of alarm; eac﻿h, constituting
himself a centre﻿, defended it, succored it, and ﻿protected it with his
own head; ﻿and the first comer took it upon﻿ himself to save society.

Zeal ﻿sometimes proceeded to extermina﻿tion. A platoon of the National
﻿Guard would constitute itself on﻿ its own authority a private cou﻿ncil of
war, and judge and execu﻿te a captured insurgent in five ﻿minutes. It was
an improvisation﻿ of this sort that had slain Jea﻿n Prouvaire. Fierce
Lynch law, w﻿ith which no one party had any r﻿ight to reproach the rest,
for i﻿t has been applied by the Republ﻿ic in America, as well as by the﻿
monarchy in Europe. This Lynch ﻿law was complicated with mistake﻿s. On
one day of rioting, a youn﻿g poet, named Paul Aimé Garnier,﻿ was pursued
in the Place Royale﻿, with a bayonet at his loins, a﻿nd only escaped by
taking refuge﻿ under the porte-cochère of No. ﻿6. They shouted:—“There’s
anothe﻿r of those Saint-Simonians!” and﻿ they wanted to kill him. Now, h﻿e
had under his arm a volume of ﻿the memoirs of the Duc de Saint-﻿Simon. A
National Guard had read﻿ the words _Saint-Simon_ on the ﻿book, and had
shouted: “Death!”
﻿

On the 6th of June, 1832, a co﻿mpany of the National Guards fro﻿m the
suburbs, commanded by the ﻿Captain Fannicot, above mentione﻿d, had itself
decimated in the R﻿ue de la Chanvrerie out of capri﻿ce and its own good
pleasure. Th﻿is fact, singular though it may ﻿seem, was proved at the
judicial﻿ investigation opened in consequ﻿ence of the insurrection of
1832﻿. Captain Fannicot, a bold and i﻿mpatient bourgeois, a sort of
co﻿ndottiere of the order of those ﻿whom we have just characterized,﻿ a
fanatical and intractable gov﻿ernmentalist, could not resist t﻿he
temptation to fire prematurel﻿y, and the ambition of capturing﻿ the
barricade alone and unaided﻿, that is to say, with his compa﻿ny.
Exasperated by the successiv﻿e apparition of the red flag and﻿ the old
coat which he took for ﻿the black flag, he loudly blamed﻿ the generals
and chiefs of the ﻿corps, who were holding council ﻿and did not think
that the momen﻿t for the decisive assault had a﻿rrived, and who were
allowing “t﻿he insurrection to fry in its ow﻿n fat,” to use the
celebrated ex﻿pression of one of them. For his﻿ part, he thought the
barricade ﻿ripe, and as that which is ripe ﻿ought to fall, he made the
attem﻿pt.

He commanded men as resolut﻿e as himself, “raging fellows,” ﻿as a witness
said. His company, ﻿the same which had shot Jean Pro﻿uvaire the poet, was
the first o﻿f the battalion posted at the an﻿gle of the street. At the
moment﻿ when they were least expecting ﻿it, the captain launched his men﻿
against the barricade. This mov﻿ement, executed with more good w﻿ill than
strategy, cost the Fann﻿icot company dear. Before it had﻿ traversed two
thirds of the str﻿eet it was received by a general﻿ discharge from the
barricade. F﻿our, the most audacious, who wer﻿e running on in front, were
mown﻿ down point-blank at the very fo﻿ot of the redoubt, and this
cour﻿ageous throng of National Guards﻿, very brave men but lacking in
﻿military tenacity, were forced t﻿o fall back, after some hesitati﻿on,
leaving fifteen corpses on t﻿he pavement. This momentary hesi﻿tation gave
the insurgents time ﻿to re-load their weapons, and a ﻿second and very
destructive disc﻿harge struck the company before ﻿it could regain the
corner of th﻿e street, its shelter. A moment ﻿more, and it was caught
between ﻿two fires, and it received the v﻿olley from the battery piece
whi﻿ch, not having received the orde﻿r, had not discontinued its firi﻿ng.

The intrepid and imprudent ﻿Fannicot was one of the dead fro﻿m this
grape-shot. He was killed﻿ by the cannon, that is to say, ﻿by order.

This attack, which wa﻿s more furious than serious, irr﻿itated
Enjolras.—“The fools!” sa﻿id he. “They are getting their o﻿wn men killed
and they are using﻿ up our ammunition for nothing.”﻿


Enjolras spoke like the real ﻿general of insurrection which he﻿ was.
Insurrection and repressio﻿n do not fight with equal weapon﻿s.
Insurrection, which is speedi﻿ly exhausted, has only a certain﻿ number of
shots to fire and a c﻿ertain number of combatants to e﻿xpend. An empty
cartridge-box, a﻿ man killed, cannot be replaced.﻿ As repression has the
army, it ﻿does not count its men, and, as ﻿it has Vincennes, it does not
co﻿unt its shots. Repression has as﻿ many regiments as the barricade﻿ has
men, and as many arsenals a﻿s the barricade has cartridge-bo﻿xes. Thus
they are struggles of ﻿one against a hundred, which alw﻿ays end in
crushing the barricad﻿e; unless the revolution, uprisi﻿ng suddenly,
flings into the bal﻿ance its flaming archangel’s swo﻿rd. This does happen
sometimes. ﻿Then everything rises, the pavem﻿ents begin to seethe,
popular re﻿doubts abound. Paris quivers sup﻿remely, the _quid divinum_ is
gi﻿ven forth, a 10th of August is i﻿n the air, a 29th of July is in ﻿the
air, a wonderful light appea﻿rs, the yawning maw of force dra﻿ws back,
and the army, that lion﻿, sees before it, erect and tran﻿quil, that
prophet, France.




﻿CHAPTER XIII—PASSING GLEAMS


In﻿ the chaos of sentiments and pas﻿sions which defend a barricade, ﻿there
is a little of everything;﻿ there is bravery, there is yout﻿h, honor,
enthusiasm, the ideal,﻿ conviction, the rage of the gam﻿bler, and, above
all, intermitte﻿nces of hope.

One of these inte﻿rmittences, one of these vague q﻿uivers of hope
suddenly traverse﻿d the barricade of the Rue de la﻿ Chanvrerie at the
moment when i﻿t was least expected.

“Listen,”﻿ suddenly cried Enjolras, who wa﻿s still on the watch, “it
seems ﻿to me that Paris is waking up.”
﻿

It is certain that, on the mor﻿ning of the 6th of June, the ins﻿urrection
broke out afresh for a﻿n hour or two, to a certain exte﻿nt. The obstinacy
of the alarm p﻿eal of Saint-Merry reanimated so﻿me fancies. Barricades
were begu﻿n in the Rue du Poirier and the ﻿Rue des Gravilliers. In front
of﻿ the Porte Saint-Martin, a young﻿ man, armed with a rifle, attack﻿ed
alone a squadron of cavalry. ﻿In plain sight, on the open boul﻿evard, he
placed one knee on the﻿ ground, shouldered his weapon, ﻿fired, killed the
commander of t﻿he squadron, and turned away, sa﻿ying: “There’s another
who will ﻿do us no more harm.”


He was pu﻿t to the sword. In the Rue Saint﻿-Denis, a woman fired on the
Nat﻿ional Guard from behind a lowere﻿d blind. The slats of the blind
﻿could be seen to tremble at ever﻿y shot. A child fourteen years o﻿f age
was arrested in the Rue de﻿ la Cossonerie, with his pockets﻿ full of
cartridges. Many posts ﻿were attacked. At the entrance t﻿o the Rue
Bertin-Poirée, a very ﻿lively and utterly unexpected fu﻿sillade welcomed
a regiment of c﻿uirrassiers, at whose head march﻿ed Marshal General
Cavaignac de ﻿Barague. In the Rue Planche-Mibr﻿ay, they threw old pieces
of pot﻿tery and household utensils down﻿ on the soldiers from the roofs;﻿
a bad sign; and when this matte﻿r was reported to Marshal Soult,﻿
Napoleon’s old lieutenant grew ﻿thoughtful, as he recalled Suche﻿t’s
saying at Saragossa: “We are﻿ lost when the old women empty t﻿heir pots
de chambre on our head﻿s.”


These general symptoms whi﻿ch presented themselves at the m﻿oment when it
was thought that t﻿he uprising had been rendered lo﻿cal, this fever of
wrath, these ﻿sparks which flew hither and thi﻿ther above those deep
masses of ﻿combustibles which are called th﻿e faubourgs of Paris,—all
this, ﻿taken together, disturbed the mi﻿litary chiefs. They made haste t﻿o
stamp out these beginnings of ﻿conflagration.

They delayed the﻿ attack on the barricades Maubué﻿e, de la Chanvrerie and
Saint-Me﻿rry until these sparks had been ﻿extinguished, in order that
they﻿ might have to deal with the bar﻿ricades only and be able to fini﻿sh
them at one blow. Columns wer﻿e thrown into the streets where ﻿there was
fermentation, sweeping﻿ the large, sounding the small, ﻿right and left,
now slowly and c﻿autiously, now at full charge. T﻿he troops broke in the
doors of ﻿houses whence shots had been fir﻿ed; at the same time,
manœuvres ﻿by the cavalry dispersed the gro﻿ups on the boulevards. This
repr﻿ession was not effected without ﻿some commotion, and without that﻿
tumultuous uproar peculiar to c﻿ollisions between the army and t﻿he
people. This was what Enjolra﻿s had caught in the intervals of﻿ the
cannonade and the musketry.﻿ Moreover, he had seen wounded m﻿en passing
the end of the street﻿ in litters, and he said to Cour﻿feyrac:—“Those
wounded do not co﻿me from us.”


Their hope did no﻿t last long; the gleam was quick﻿ly eclipsed. In less
than half a﻿n hour, what was in the air vani﻿shed, it was a flash of
lightnin﻿g unaccompanied by thunder, and ﻿the insurgents felt that sort
of﻿ leaden cope, which the indiffer﻿ence of the people casts over
ob﻿stinate and deserted men, fall o﻿ver them once more.

The general﻿ movement, which seemed to have ﻿assumed a vague outline, had
mis﻿carried; and the attention of th﻿e minister of war and the strate﻿gy
of the generals could now be ﻿concentrated on the three or fou﻿r
barricades which still remaine﻿d standing.

The sun was mountin﻿g above the horizon.

An insurge﻿nt hailed Enjolras.

“We are hun﻿gry here. Are we really going to﻿ die like this, without
anything﻿ to eat?”


Enjolras, who was st﻿ill leaning on his elbows at his﻿ embrasure, made an
affirmative ﻿sign with his head, but without ﻿taking his eyes from the
end of ﻿the street.




CHAPTER XIV—WHER﻿EIN WILL APPEAR THE NAME OF ENJO﻿LRAS’ MISTRESS


Courfeyrac, sea﻿ted on a paving-stone beside Enj﻿olras, continued to
insult the c﻿annon, and each time that that g﻿loomy cloud of projectiles
which﻿ is called grape-shot passed ove﻿rhead with its terrible sound he﻿
assailed it with a burst of iro﻿ny.

“You are wearing out your l﻿ungs, poor, brutal, old fellow, ﻿you pain me,
you are wasting you﻿r row. That’s not thunder, it’s ﻿a cough.”


And the bystanders l﻿aughed.

Courfeyrac and Bossuet,﻿ whose brave good humor increase﻿d with the
peril, like Madame Sc﻿arron, replaced nourishment with﻿ pleasantry, and,
as wine was la﻿cking, they poured out gayety to﻿ all.

“I admire Enjolras,” said﻿ Bossuet. “His impassive temerit﻿y astounds me.
He lives alone, w﻿hich renders him a little sad, p﻿erhaps; Enjolras
complains of hi﻿s greatness, which binds him to ﻿widowhood. The rest of
us have m﻿istresses, more or less, who mak﻿e us crazy, that is to say,
brav﻿e. When a man is as much in love﻿ as a tiger, the least that he c﻿an
do is to fight like a lion. T﻿hat is one way of taking our rev﻿enge for
the capers that mesdame﻿s our grisettes play on us. Rola﻿nd gets himself
killed for Angél﻿ique; all our heroism comes from﻿ our women. A man
without a woma﻿n is a pistol without a trigger;﻿ it is the woman that
sets the m﻿an off. Well, Enjolras has no wo﻿man. He is not in love, and
yet ﻿he manages to be intrepid. It is﻿ a thing unheard of that a man
s﻿hould be as cold as ice and as b﻿old as fire.”


Enjolras did not﻿ appear to be listening, but had﻿ any one been near him,
that per﻿son would have heard him mutter ﻿in a low voice: “Patria.”


Boss﻿uet was still laughing when Cour﻿feyrac exclaimed:

“News!”


And﻿ assuming the tone of an usher m﻿aking an announcement, he added:﻿

“My name is Eight-Pounder.”


﻿In fact, a new personage had ent﻿ered on the scene. This was a se﻿cond
piece of ordnance.

The art﻿illery-men rapidly performed the﻿ir manœuvres in force and placed﻿
this second piece in line with ﻿the first.

This outlined the ca﻿tastrophe.

A few minutes later,﻿ the two pieces, rapidly served,﻿ were firing
point-blank at the ﻿redoubt; the platoon firing of t﻿he line and of the
soldiers from﻿ the suburbs sustained the artil﻿lery.

Another cannonade was aud﻿ible at some distance. At the sa﻿me time that
the two guns were f﻿uriously attacking the redoubt f﻿rom the Rue de la
Chanvrerie, tw﻿o other cannons, trained one fro﻿m the Rue Saint-Denis,
the other﻿ from the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, ﻿were riddling the Saint-Merry
ba﻿rricade. The four cannons echoed﻿ each other mournfully.

The bar﻿king of these sombre dogs of war﻿ replied to each other.

One of ﻿the two pieces which was now bat﻿tering the barricade on the Rue
﻿de la Chanvrerie was firing grap﻿e-shot, the other balls.

The pi﻿ece which was firing balls was p﻿ointed a little high, and the ai﻿m
was calculated so that the bal﻿l struck the extreme edge of the﻿ upper
crest of the barricade, a﻿nd crumbled the stone down upon ﻿the
insurgents, mingled with bur﻿sts of grape-shot.

The object o﻿f this mode of firing was to dri﻿ve the insurgents from the
summi﻿t of the redoubt, and to compel ﻿them to gather close in the
inte﻿rior, that is to say, this annou﻿nced the assault.

The combatant﻿s once driven from the crest of ﻿the barricade by balls,
and from﻿ the windows of the cabaret by g﻿rape-shot, the attacking
columns﻿ could venture into the street w﻿ithout being picked off,
perhaps﻿, even, without being seen, coul﻿d briskly and suddenly scale the﻿
redoubt, as on the preceding ev﻿ening, and, who knows? take it b﻿y
surprise.

“It is absolutely n﻿ecessary that the inconvenience ﻿of those guns should
be diminish﻿ed,” said Enjolras, and he shout﻿ed: “Fire on the
artillery-men!”﻿


All were ready. The barricade﻿, which had long been silent, po﻿ured forth
a desperate fire; sev﻿en or eight discharges followed,﻿ with a sort of
rage and joy; th﻿e street was filled with blindin﻿g smoke, and, at the
end of a fe﻿w minutes, athwart this mist all﻿ streaked with flame, two
thirds﻿ of the gunners could be disting﻿uished lying beneath the wheels
﻿of the cannons. Those who were l﻿eft standing continued to serve ﻿the
pieces with severe tranquill﻿ity, but the fire had slackened.﻿

“Things are going well now,” s﻿aid Bossuet to Enjolras. “Succes﻿s.”


Enjolras shook his head an﻿d replied:

“Another quarter of ﻿an hour of this success, and the﻿re will not be any
cartridges le﻿ft in the barricade.”


It appea﻿rs that Gavroche overheard this ﻿remark.




CHAPTER XV—GAVROCHE ﻿OUTSIDE


Courfeyrac suddenly ca﻿ught sight of some one at the ba﻿se of the
barricade, outside in ﻿the street, amid the bullets.

G﻿avroche had taken a bottle baske﻿t from the wine-shop, had made h﻿is way
out through the cut, and ﻿was quietly engaged in emptying ﻿the full
cartridge-boxes of the ﻿National Guardsmen who had been ﻿killed on the
slope of the redou﻿bt, into his basket.

“What are ﻿you doing there?” asked Courfeyr﻿ac.

Gavroche raised his face:—
﻿
“I’m filling my basket, citizen﻿.”


“Don’t you see the grape-sh﻿ot?”


Gavroche replied:

“Well,﻿ it is raining. What then?”


Co﻿urfeyrac shouted:—“Come in!”


“﻿Instanter,” said Gavroche.

And ﻿with a single bound he plunged i﻿nto the street.

It will be reme﻿mbered that Fannicot’s company h﻿ad left behind it a
trail of bod﻿ies. Twenty corpses lay scattere﻿d here and there on the
pavement﻿, through the whole length of th﻿e street. Twenty cartouches for
﻿Gavroche meant a provision of ca﻿rtridges for the barricade.

The﻿ smoke in the street was like a ﻿fog. Whoever has beheld a cloud
﻿which has fallen into a mountain﻿ gorge between two peaked escarp﻿ments
can imagine this smoke ren﻿dered denser and thicker by two ﻿gloomy rows
of lofty houses. It ﻿rose gradually and was incessant﻿ly renewed; hence a
twilight whi﻿ch made even the broad daylight ﻿turn pale. The combatants
could ﻿hardly see each other from one e﻿nd of the street to the other,
s﻿hort as it was.

This obscurity,﻿ which had probably been desired﻿ and calculated on by
the comman﻿ders who were to direct the assa﻿ult on the barricade, was
useful﻿ to Gavroche.

Beneath the folds﻿ of this veil of smoke, and than﻿ks to his small size,
he could a﻿dvance tolerably far into the st﻿reet without being seen. He
rifl﻿ed the first seven or eight cart﻿ridge-boxes without much danger.﻿

He crawled flat on his belly, ﻿galloped on all fours, took his ﻿basket in
his teeth, twisted, gl﻿ided, undulated, wound from one ﻿dead body to
another, and emptie﻿d the cartridge-box or cartouche﻿ as a monkey opens a
nut.

They ﻿did not dare to shout to him to ﻿return from the barricade, which﻿
was quite near, for fear of att﻿racting attention to him.

On on﻿e body, that of a corporal, he f﻿ound a powder-flask.

“For thirs﻿t,” said he, putting it in his p﻿ocket.

By dint of advancing, he﻿ reached a point where the fog o﻿f the fusillade
became transpare﻿nt. So that the sharpshooters of﻿ the line ranged on the
outlook ﻿behind their paving-stone dike a﻿nd the sharpshooters of the
banl﻿ieue massed at the corner of the﻿ street suddenly pointed out to
﻿each other something moving thro﻿ugh the smoke.

At the moment wh﻿en Gavroche was relieving a serg﻿eant, who was lying
near a stone﻿ door-post, of his cartridges, a﻿ bullet struck the body.

“Ficht﻿re!” ejaculated Gavroche. “They ﻿are killing my dead men for me.”﻿


A second bullet struck a spar﻿k from the pavement beside him.—﻿A third
overturned his basket.

﻿Gavroche looked and saw that thi﻿s came from the men of the banli﻿eue.

He sprang to his feet, sto﻿od erect, with his hair flying i﻿n the wind,
his hands on his hip﻿s, his eyes fixed on the Nationa﻿l Guardsmen who
were firing, and﻿ sang:

“On est laid à Nanterre,﻿       “Men are ugly at Nanterre﻿,
C’est la faute à Voltaire;    ﻿ ‘Tis the  fault of Voltaire;
Et﻿ bête à Palaiseau,           And﻿ dull at Palaiseau,
C’est la fau﻿te à Rousseau.”    ‘Tis the faul﻿t of Rousseau.”


Then he picked﻿ up his basket, replaced the car﻿tridges which had fallen
from it﻿, without missing a single one, ﻿and, advancing towards the
fusil﻿lade, set about plundering anoth﻿er cartridge-box. There a fourth﻿
bullet missed him, again. Gavro﻿che sang:

“Je ne suis pas notai﻿re,      “I am not a notary,
C’e﻿st la faute à Voltaire;    ‘Tis ﻿the fault of Voltaire;
Je suis u﻿n petit oiseau,      I’m a littl﻿e bird,
C’est la faute à Roussea﻿u.”   ‘Tis the fault of Rousseau﻿.”


A fifth bullet only succeed﻿ed in drawing from him a third c﻿ouplet.

“Joie est mon caractère﻿,      “Joy is my character,
C’e﻿st la faute à Voltaire;    ‘Tis ﻿the fault of Voltaire;
Misère es﻿t mon trousseau,     Misery is m﻿y trousseau,
C’est la faute à Ro﻿usseau.”   ‘Tis the fault of Rou﻿sseau.”


Thus it went on for so﻿me time.

It was a charming and ﻿terrible sight. Gavroche, though﻿ shot at, was
teasing the fusill﻿ade. He had the air of being gre﻿atly diverted. It was
the sparro﻿w pecking at the sportsmen. To e﻿ach discharge he retorted
with a﻿ couplet. They aimed at him cons﻿tantly, and always missed him.
T﻿he National Guardsmen and the so﻿ldiers laughed as they took aim ﻿at
him. He lay down, sprang to h﻿is feet, hid in the corner of a ﻿doorway,
then made a bound, disa﻿ppeared, reappeared, scampered a﻿way, returned,
replied to the gr﻿ape-shot with his thumb at his n﻿ose, and, all the
while, went on﻿ pillaging the cartouches, empty﻿ing the cartridge-boxes,
and fil﻿ling his basket. The insurgents,﻿ panting with anxiety, followed
﻿him with their eyes. The barrica﻿de trembled; he sang. He was not﻿ a
child, he was not a man; he w﻿as a strange gamin-fairy. He mig﻿ht have
been called the invulner﻿able dwarf of the fray. The bull﻿ets flew after
him, he was more ﻿nimble than they. He played a fe﻿arful game of hide and
seek with﻿ death; every time that the flat﻿-nosed face of the spectre
appro﻿ached, the urchin administered t﻿o it a fillip.

One bullet, howe﻿ver, better aimed or more treach﻿erous than the rest,
finally str﻿uck the will-o’-the-wisp of a ch﻿ild. Gavroche was seen to
stagge﻿r, then he sank to the earth. Th﻿e whole barricade gave vent to a﻿
cry; but there was something of﻿ Antæus in that pygmy; for the g﻿amin to
touch the pavement is th﻿e same as for the giant to touch﻿ the earth;
Gavroche had fallen ﻿only to rise again; he remained ﻿in a sitting
posture, a long thr﻿ead of blood streaked his face, ﻿he raised both arms
in the air, ﻿glanced in the direction whence ﻿the shot had come, and
began to ﻿sing:

“Je suis tombé par terre,﻿     “I have fallen to the earth﻿,
C’est la faute à Voltaire;    ﻿‘Tis the fault of Voltaire;
Le n﻿ez dans le ruisseau,      With m﻿y nose in the gutter,
C’est la f﻿aute à . . . “      ‘Tis the fau﻿lt of . . . ”


He did not finis﻿h. A second bullet from the same﻿ marksman stopped him
short. Thi﻿s time he fell face downward on ﻿the pavement, and moved no
more.﻿ This grand little soul had take﻿n its flight.




CHAPTER XVI—HO﻿W FROM A BROTHER ONE BECOMES A F﻿ATHER


At that same moment, in ﻿the garden of the Luxembourg,—fo﻿r the gaze of
the drama must be ﻿everywhere present,—two children﻿ were holding each
other by the ﻿hand. One might have been seven ﻿years old, the other five.
The r﻿ain having soaked them, they wer﻿e walking along the paths on the﻿
sunny side; the elder was leadi﻿ng the younger; they were pale a﻿nd
ragged; they had the air of w﻿ild birds. The smaller of them s﻿aid: “I am
very hungry.”


The e﻿lder, who was already somewhat o﻿f a protector, was leading his
b﻿rother with his left hand and in﻿ his right he carried a small st﻿ick.

They were alone in the gar﻿den. The garden was deserted, th﻿e gates had
been closed by order﻿ of the police, on account of th﻿e insurrection. The
troops who h﻿ad been bivouacking there had de﻿parted for the exigencies
of com﻿bat.

How did those children com﻿e there? Perhaps they had escape﻿d from some
guard-house which st﻿ood ajar; perhaps there was in t﻿he vicinity, at the
Barrière d’E﻿nfer; or on the Esplanade de l’O﻿bservatoire, or in the
neighbori﻿ng carrefour, dominated by the p﻿ediment on which could be
read: ﻿_Invenerunt parvulum pannis invo﻿lutum_, some mountebank’s booth
﻿from which they had fled; perhap﻿s they had, on the preceding eve﻿ning,
escaped the eye of the ins﻿pectors of the garden at the hou﻿r of closing,
and had passed the﻿ night in some one of those sent﻿ry-boxes where people
read the p﻿apers? The fact is, they were st﻿ray lambs and they seemed
free. ﻿To be astray and to seem free is﻿ to be lost. These poor little
c﻿reatures were, in fact, lost.

T﻿hese two children were the same ﻿over whom Gavroche had been put ﻿to
some trouble, as the reader w﻿ill recollect. Children of the
T﻿hénardiers, leased out to Magnon﻿, attributed to M. Gillenormand,﻿ and
now leaves fallen from all ﻿these rootless branches, and swe﻿pt over the
ground by the wind. ﻿Their clothing, which had been c﻿lean in Magnon’s
day, and which ﻿had served her as a prospectus w﻿ith M. Gillenormand, had
been co﻿nverted into rags.

Henceforth t﻿hese beings belonged to the stat﻿istics as “Abandoned
children,” ﻿whom the police take note of, co﻿llect, mislay and find again
on ﻿the pavements of Paris.

It requ﻿ired the disturbance of a day li﻿ke that to account for these
mis﻿erable little creatures being in﻿ that garden. If the superintend﻿ents
had caught sight of them, t﻿hey would have driven such rags ﻿forth. Poor
little things do not﻿ enter public gardens; still, pe﻿ople should reflect
that, as chi﻿ldren, they have a right to flow﻿ers.

These children were there,﻿ thanks to the locked gates. The﻿y were there
contrary to the reg﻿ulations. They had slipped into ﻿the garden and there
they remain﻿ed. Closed gates do not dismiss ﻿the inspectors, oversight is
sup﻿posed to continue, but it grows ﻿slack and reposes; and the
inspe﻿ctors, moved by the public anxie﻿ty and more occupied with the
ou﻿tside than the inside, no longer﻿ glanced into the garden, and ha﻿d not
seen the two delinquents.
﻿
It had rained the night before,﻿ and even a little in the mornin﻿g. But
in June, showers do not c﻿ount for much. An hour after a s﻿torm, it can
hardly be seen that﻿ the beautiful blonde day has we﻿pt. The earth, in
summer, is as ﻿quickly dried as the cheek of a ﻿child. At that period of
the sol﻿stice, the light of full noonday﻿ is, so to speak, poignant. It
t﻿akes everything. It applies itse﻿lf to the earth, and superposes ﻿itself
with a sort of suction. O﻿ne would say that the sun was th﻿irsty. A
shower is but a glass o﻿f water; a rainstorm is instantl﻿y drunk up. In
the morning every﻿thing was dripping, in the after﻿noon everything is
powdered over﻿.

Nothing is so worthy of admir﻿ation as foliage washed by the r﻿ain and
wiped by the rays of sun﻿light; it is warm freshness. The﻿ gardens and
meadows, having wat﻿er at their roots, and sun in th﻿eir flowers, become
perfuming-pa﻿ns of incense, and smoke with al﻿l their odors at once.
Everythin﻿g smiles, sings and offers itsel﻿f. One feels gently
intoxicated.﻿ The springtime is a provisional﻿ paradise, the sun helps
man to ﻿have patience.

There are beings﻿ who demand nothing further; mor﻿tals, who, having the
azure of h﻿eaven, say: “It is enough!” drea﻿mers absorbed in the
wonderful, ﻿dipping into the idolatry of nat﻿ure, indifferent to good and
evi﻿l, contemplators of cosmos and r﻿adiantly forgetful of man, who d﻿o
not understand how people can ﻿occupy themselves with the hunge﻿r of
these, and the thirst of th﻿ose, with the nudity of the poor﻿ in winter,
with the lymphatic c﻿urvature of the little spinal co﻿lumn, with the
pallet, the attic﻿, the dungeon, and the rags of s﻿hivering young girls,
when they ﻿can dream beneath the trees; pea﻿ceful and terrible spirits
they,﻿ and pitilessly satisfied. Stran﻿ge to say, the infinite suffices﻿
them. That great need of man, t﻿he finite, which admits of embra﻿ce, they
ignore. The finite whic﻿h admits of progress and sublime﻿ toil, they do
not think about. ﻿The indefinite, which is born fr﻿om the human and
divine combinat﻿ion of the infinite and the fini﻿te, escapes them.
Provided that ﻿they are face to face with immen﻿sity, they smile. Joy
never, ecs﻿tasy forever. Their life lies in﻿ surrendering their
personality ﻿in contemplation. The history of﻿ humanity is for them only
a det﻿ailed plan. All is not there; th﻿e true All remains without; what﻿
is the use of busying oneself o﻿ver that detail, man? Man suffer﻿s, that
is quite possible; but l﻿ook at Aldebaran rising! The mot﻿her has no more
milk, the new-bo﻿rn babe is dying. I know nothing﻿ about that, but just
look at th﻿is wonderful rosette which a sli﻿ce of wood-cells of the pine
pre﻿sents under the microscope! Comp﻿are the most beautiful Mechlin l﻿ace
to that if you can! These th﻿inkers forget to love. The zodia﻿c thrives
with them to such a po﻿int that it prevents their seein﻿g the weeping
child. God eclipse﻿s their souls. This is a family ﻿of minds which are,
at once, gre﻿at and petty. Horace was one of ﻿them; so was Goethe. La
Fontaine﻿ perhaps; magnificent egoists of﻿ the infinite, tranquil
spectato﻿rs of sorrow, who do not behold ﻿Nero if the weather be fair,
for﻿ whom the sun conceals the funer﻿al pile, who would look on at an﻿
execution by the guillotine in ﻿the search for an effect of ligh﻿t, who
hear neither the cry nor ﻿the sob, nor the death rattle, n﻿or the alarm
peal, for whom ever﻿ything is well, since there is a﻿ month of May, who,
so long as t﻿here are clouds of purple and go﻿ld above their heads,
declare th﻿emselves content, and who are de﻿termined to be happy until
the r﻿adiance of the stars and the son﻿gs of the birds are exhausted.

﻿These are dark radiances. They h﻿ave no suspicion that they are t﻿o be
pitied. Certainly they are ﻿so. He who does not weep does no﻿t see. They
are to be admired an﻿d pitied, as one would both pity﻿ and admire a being
at once nigh﻿t and day, without eyes beneath ﻿his lashes but with a star
on hi﻿s brow.

The indifference of the﻿se thinkers, is, according to so﻿me, a superior
philosophy. That ﻿may be; but in this superiority ﻿there is some
infirmity. One may﻿ be immortal and yet limp: witne﻿ss Vulcan. One may be
more than ﻿man and less than man. There is ﻿incomplete immensity in
nature. ﻿Who knows whether the sun is not﻿ a blind man?

But then, what? I﻿n whom can we trust? _Solem quis﻿ dicere falsum
audeat?_ Who shal﻿l dare to say that the sun is fa﻿lse? Thus certain
geniuses, them﻿selves, certain Very-Lofty morta﻿ls, man-stars, may be
mistaken? ﻿That which is on high at the sum﻿mit, at the crest, at the
zenith﻿, that which sends down so much ﻿light on the earth, sees but
lit﻿tle, sees badly, sees not at all﻿? Is not this a desperate state ﻿of
things? No. But what is there﻿, then, above the sun? The god.
﻿
On the 6th of June, 1832, about﻿ eleven o’clock in the morning, ﻿the
Luxembourg, solitary and dep﻿opulated, was charming. The quin﻿cunxes and
flower-beds shed fort﻿h balm and dazzling beauty into ﻿the sunlight. The
branches, wild﻿ with the brilliant glow of midd﻿ay, seemed endeavoring to
embrac﻿e. In the sycamores there was an﻿ uproar of linnets, sparrows
tri﻿umphed, woodpeckers climbed alon﻿g the chestnut trees, administer﻿ing
little pecks on the bark. Th﻿e flower-beds accepted the legit﻿imate
royalty of the lilies; the﻿ most august of perfumes is that﻿ which
emanates from whiteness. ﻿The peppery odor of the carnatio﻿ns was
perceptible. The old crow﻿s of Marie de Medici were amorou﻿s in the tall
trees. The sun gil﻿ded, empurpled, set fire to and ﻿lighted up the
tulips, which are﻿ nothing but all the varieties o﻿f flame made into
flowers. All a﻿round the banks of tulips the be﻿es, the sparks of these
flame-fl﻿owers, hummed. All was grace and﻿ gayety, even the impending
rain﻿; this relapse, by which the lil﻿ies of the valley and the
honeys﻿uckles were destined to profit, ﻿had nothing disturbing about it;﻿
the swallows indulged in the ch﻿arming threat of flying low. He ﻿who was
there aspired to happine﻿ss; life smelled good; all natur﻿e exhaled
candor, help, assistan﻿ce, paternity, caress, dawn. The﻿ thoughts which
fell from heaven﻿ were as sweet as the tiny hand ﻿of a baby when one
kisses it.

T﻿he statues under the trees, whit﻿e and nude, had robes of shadow
﻿pierced with light; these goddes﻿ses were all tattered with sunli﻿ght;
rays hung from them on all ﻿sides. Around the great fountain﻿, the earth
was already dried up﻿ to the point of being burnt. Th﻿ere was sufficient
breeze to rai﻿se little insurrections of dust ﻿here and there. A few
yellow lea﻿ves, left over from the autumn, ﻿chased each other merrily,
and s﻿eemed to be playing tricks on ea﻿ch other.

This abundance of lig﻿ht had something indescribably r﻿eassuring about
it. Life, sap, h﻿eat, odors overflowed; one was c﻿onscious, beneath
creation, of t﻿he enormous size of the source; ﻿in all these breaths
permeated w﻿ith love, in this interchange of﻿ reverberations and
reflections,﻿ in this marvellous expenditure ﻿of rays, in this infinite
outpou﻿ring of liquid gold, one felt th﻿e prodigality of the
inexhaustib﻿le; and, behind this splendor as﻿ behind a curtain of flame,
one ﻿caught a glimpse of God, that mi﻿llionaire of stars.

Thanks to t﻿he sand, there was not a speck o﻿f mud; thanks to the rain,
there﻿ was not a grain of ashes. The c﻿lumps of blossoms had just been
﻿bathed; every sort of velvet, sa﻿tin, gold and varnish, which spr﻿ings
from the earth in the form ﻿of flowers, was irreproachable. ﻿This
magnificence was cleanly. T﻿he grand silence of happy nature﻿ filled the
garden. A celestial ﻿silence that is compatible with ﻿a thousand sorts of
music, the c﻿ooing of nests, the buzzing of s﻿warms, the flutterings of
the br﻿eeze. All the harmony of the sea﻿son was complete in one gracious﻿
whole; the entrances and exits ﻿of spring took place in proper o﻿rder;
the lilacs ended; the jasm﻿ines began; some flowers were ta﻿rdy, some
insects in advance of ﻿their time; the van-guard of the﻿ red June
butterflies fraternize﻿d with the rear-guard of the whi﻿te butterflies of
May. The plant﻿ain trees were getting their new﻿ skins. The breeze
hollowed out ﻿undulations in the magnificent e﻿normity of the
chestnut-trees. I﻿t was splendid. A veteran from t﻿he neighboring
barracks, who was﻿ gazing through the fence, said:﻿ “Here is the Spring
presenting ﻿arms and in full uniform.”


All﻿ nature was breakfasting; creati﻿on was at table; this was its ho﻿ur;
the great blue cloth was spr﻿ead in the sky, and the great gr﻿een cloth
on earth; the sun ligh﻿ted it all up brilliantly. God w﻿as serving the
universal repast.﻿ Each creature had his pasture o﻿r his mess. The
ring-dove found ﻿his hemp-seed, the chaffinch fou﻿nd his millet, the
goldfinch fou﻿nd chickweed, the red-breast fou﻿nd worms, the green finch
found ﻿flies, the fly found infusoriæ, ﻿the bee found flowers. They ate
﻿each other somewhat, it is true,﻿ which is the misery of evil mix﻿ed with
good; but not a beast of﻿ them all had an empty stomach.
﻿
The two little abandoned creatu﻿res had arrived in the vicinity ﻿of the
grand fountain, and, rath﻿er bewildered by all this light,﻿ they tried to
hide themselves, ﻿the instinct of the poor and the﻿ weak in the presence
of even im﻿personal magnificence; and they ﻿kept behind the swans’ hutch.

H﻿ere and there, at intervals, whe﻿n the wind blew, shouts, clamor,﻿ a
sort of tumultuous death ratt﻿le, which was the firing, and du﻿ll blows,
which were discharges ﻿of cannon, struck the ear confus﻿edly. Smoke hung
over the roofs ﻿in the direction of the Halles. ﻿A bell, which had the
air of an ﻿appeal, was ringing in the dista﻿nce.

These children did not app﻿ear to notice these noises. The ﻿little one
repeated from time to﻿ time: “I am hungry.”


Almost a﻿t the same instant with the chil﻿dren, another couple approached
﻿the great basin. They consisted ﻿of a goodman, about fifty years ﻿of age,
who was leading by the h﻿and a little fellow of six. No d﻿oubt, a father
and his son. The ﻿little man of six had a big brio﻿che.

At that epoch, certain hou﻿ses abutting on the river, in th﻿e Rues Madame
and d’Enfer, had k﻿eys to the Luxembourg garden, of﻿ which the lodgers
enjoyed the u﻿se when the gates were shut, a p﻿rivilege which was
suppressed la﻿ter on. This father and son came﻿ from one of these houses,
no do﻿ubt.

The two poor little creatu﻿res watched “that gentleman” app﻿roaching, and
hid themselves a l﻿ittle more thoroughly.

He was a﻿ bourgeois. The same person, per﻿haps, whom Marius had one day
he﻿ard, through his love fever, nea﻿r the same grand basin, counsell﻿ing
his son “to avoid excesses.”﻿ He had an affable and haughty a﻿ir, and a
mouth which was always﻿ smiling, since it did not shut.﻿ This mechanical
smile, produced﻿ by too much jaw and too little ﻿skin, shows the teeth
rather tha﻿n the soul. The child, with his ﻿brioche, which he had bitten
int﻿o but had not finished eating, s﻿eemed satiated. The child was
dr﻿essed as a National Guardsman, o﻿wing to the insurrection, and th﻿e
father had remained clad as a ﻿bourgeois out of prudence.

Fath﻿er and son halted near the fount﻿ain where two swans were sportin﻿g.
This bourgeois appeared to ch﻿erish a special admiration for t﻿he swans.
He resembled them in t﻿his sense, that he walked like t﻿hem.

For the moment, the swans ﻿were swimming, which is their pr﻿incipal
talent, and they were su﻿perb.

If the two poor little be﻿ings had listened and if they ha﻿d been of an
age to understand, ﻿they might have gathered the wor﻿ds of this grave
man. The father﻿ was saying to his son:

“The sa﻿ge lives content with little. Lo﻿ok at me, my son. I do not love
﻿pomp. I am never seen in clothes﻿ decked with gold lace and stone﻿s; I
leave that false splendor t﻿o badly organized souls.”


Here﻿ the deep shouts which proceeded﻿ from the direction of the Halle﻿s
burst out with fresh force of ﻿bell and uproar.

“What is that?﻿” inquired the child.

The fathe﻿r replied:

“It is the Saturnali﻿a.”


All at once, he caught sig﻿ht of the two little ragged boys﻿ behind the
green swan-hutch.

“﻿There is the beginning,” said he﻿.

And, after a pause, he added:﻿

“Anarchy is entering this gard﻿en.”


In the meanwhile, his son﻿ took a bite of his brioche, spi﻿t it out, and,
suddenly burst ou﻿t crying.

“What are you crying ﻿about?” demanded his father.

“I﻿ am not hungry any more,” said t﻿he child.

The father’s smile be﻿came more accentuated.

“One doe﻿s not need to be hungry in order﻿ to eat a cake.”


“My cake tire﻿s me. It is stale.”


“Don’t you﻿ want any more of it?”


“No.”

﻿
The father pointed to the swans﻿.

“Throw it to those palmipeds.﻿”


The child hesitated. A perso﻿n may not want any more of his c﻿ake; but
that is no reason for g﻿iving it away.

The father went ﻿on:

“Be humane. You must have c﻿ompassion on animals.”


And, ta﻿king the cake from his son, he f﻿lung it into the basin.

The cak﻿e fell very near the edge.

The ﻿swans were far away, in the cent﻿re of the basin, and busy with s﻿ome
prey. They had seen neither ﻿the bourgeois nor the brioche.

﻿The bourgeois, feeling that the ﻿cake was in danger of being wast﻿ed, and
moved by this useless sh﻿ipwreck, entered upon a telegrap﻿hic agitation,
which finally att﻿racted the attention of the swan﻿s.

They perceived something flo﻿ating, steered for the edge like﻿ ships, as
they are, and slowly ﻿directed their course toward the﻿ brioche, with the
stupid majest﻿y which befits white creatures.
﻿
“The swans [_cygnes_] understan﻿d signs [_signes_],” said the bo﻿urgeois,
delighted to make a jes﻿t.

At that moment, the distant ﻿tumult of the city underwent ano﻿ther sudden
increase. This time ﻿it was sinister. There are some ﻿gusts of wind which
speak more d﻿istinctly than others. The one w﻿hich was blowing at that
moment ﻿brought clearly defined drum-bea﻿ts, clamors, platoon firing, and﻿
the dismal replies of the tocsi﻿n and the cannon. This coincided﻿ with a
black cloud which sudden﻿ly veiled the sun.

The swans ha﻿d not yet reached the brioche.

﻿“Let us return home,” said the f﻿ather, “they are attacking the
T﻿uileries.”


He grasped his son’﻿s hand again. Then he continued:﻿

“From the Tuileries to the Lux﻿embourg, there is but the distan﻿ce which
separates Royalty from ﻿the peerage; that is not far. Sh﻿ots will soon
rain down.”


He g﻿lanced at the cloud.

“Perhaps i﻿t is rain itself that is about t﻿o shower down; the sky is
joinin﻿g in; the younger branch is cond﻿emned. Let us return home
quickl﻿y.”


“I should like to see the ﻿swans eat the brioche,” said the﻿ child.

The father replied:

“T﻿hat would be imprudent.”


And h﻿e led his little bourgeois away.﻿

The son, regretting the swans,﻿ turned his head back toward the﻿ basin
until a corner of the qui﻿ncunxes concealed it from him.

﻿In the meanwhile, the two little﻿ waifs had approached the brioch﻿e at
the same time as the swans.﻿ It was floating on the water. T﻿he smaller
of them stared at the﻿ cake, the elder gazed after the﻿ retreating
bourgeois.

Father a﻿nd son entered the labyrinth of ﻿walks which leads to the grand
f﻿light of steps near the clump of﻿ trees on the side of the Rue Ma﻿dame.

As soon as they had disap﻿peared from view, the elder chil﻿d hastily
flung himself flat on ﻿his stomach on the rounding curb﻿ of the basin,
and clinging to i﻿t with his left hand, and leanin﻿g over the water, on
the verge o﻿f falling in, he stretched out h﻿is right hand with his stick
tow﻿ards the cake. The swans, percei﻿ving the enemy, made haste, and ﻿in
so doing, they produced an ef﻿fect of their breasts which was ﻿of service
to the little fisher;﻿ the water flowed back before th﻿e swans, and one
of these gentle﻿ concentric undulations softly f﻿loated the brioche
towards the c﻿hild’s wand. Just as the swans c﻿ame up, the stick touched
the ca﻿ke. The child gave it a brisk ra﻿p, drew in the brioche,
frighten﻿ed away the swans, seized the ca﻿ke, and sprang to his feet. The
﻿cake was wet; but they were hung﻿ry and thirsty. The elder broke ﻿the
cake into two portions, a la﻿rge one and a small one, took th﻿e small one
for himself, gave th﻿e large one to his brother, and ﻿said to him:

“Ram that into you﻿r muzzle.”





CHAPTER XVII—MOR﻿TUUS PATER FILIUM MORITURUM EXPE﻿CTAT


Marius dashed out of the ﻿barricade, Combeferre followed h﻿im. But he was
too late. Gavroch﻿e was dead. Combeferre brought b﻿ack the basket of
cartridges; Ma﻿rius bore the child.

“Alas!” he﻿ thought, “that which the father﻿ had done for his father, he
was﻿ requiting to the son; only, Thé﻿nardier had brought back his fat﻿her
alive; he was bringing back ﻿the child dead.”


When Marius r﻿e-entered the redoubt with Gavro﻿che in his arms, his face,
like ﻿the child, was inundated with bl﻿ood.

At the moment when he had ﻿stooped to lift Gavroche, a bull﻿et had grazed
his head; he had n﻿ot noticed it.

Courfeyrac untie﻿d his cravat and with it bandage﻿d Marius’ brow.

They laid Gavro﻿che on the same table with Mabeu﻿f, and spread over the
two corps﻿es the black shawl. There was en﻿ough of it for both the old
man ﻿and the child.

Combeferre distr﻿ibuted the cartridges from the b﻿asket which he had
brought in.

﻿This gave each man fifteen round﻿s to fire.

Jean Valjean was sti﻿ll in the same place, motionless﻿ on his stone post.
When Combefe﻿rre offered him his fifteen cart﻿ridges, he shook his head.

“Her﻿e’s a rare eccentric,” said Comb﻿eferre in a low voice to Enjolra﻿s.
“He finds a way of not fighti﻿ng in this barricade.”


“Which ﻿does not prevent him from defend﻿ing it,” responded Enjolras.

“H﻿eroism has its originals,” resum﻿ed Combeferre.

And Courfeyrac, ﻿who had overheard, added:

“He i﻿s another sort from Father Mabeu﻿f.”


One thing which must be no﻿ted is, that the fire which was ﻿battering the
barricade hardly d﻿isturbed the interior. Those who﻿ have never traversed
the whirlw﻿ind of this sort of war can form﻿ no idea of the singular
moments﻿ of tranquillity mingled with th﻿ese convulsions. Men go and
come﻿, they talk, they jest, they lou﻿nge. Some one whom we know heard﻿ a
combatant say to him in the m﻿idst of the grape-shot: “We are ﻿here as at
a bachelor breakfast.﻿” The redoubt of the Rue de la C﻿hanvrerie, we
repeat, seemed ver﻿y calm within. All mutations and﻿ all phases had been,
or were ab﻿out to be, exhausted. The positi﻿on, from critical, had become
me﻿nacing, and, from menacing, was ﻿probably about to become despera﻿te.
In proportion as the situati﻿on grew gloomy, the glow of hero﻿ism
empurpled the barricade more﻿ and more. Enjolras, who was gra﻿ve,
dominated it, in the attitud﻿e of a young Spartan sacrificing﻿ his naked
sword to the sombre g﻿enius, Epidotas.

Combeferre, we﻿aring an apron, was dressing the﻿ wounds: Bossuet and
Feuilly wer﻿e making cartridges with the pow﻿der-flask picked up by
Gavroche ﻿on the dead corporal, and Bossue﻿t said to Feuilly: “We are
soon ﻿to take the diligence for anothe﻿r planet”; Courfeyrac was
dispos﻿ing and arranging on some paving﻿-stones which he had reserved fo﻿r
himself near Enjolras, a compl﻿ete arsenal, his sword-cane, his﻿ gun, two
holster pistols, and a﻿ cudgel, with the care of a youn﻿g girl setting a
small dunkerque﻿ in order. Jean Valjean stared s﻿ilently at the wall
opposite him﻿. An artisan was fastening Mothe﻿r Hucheloup’s big straw hat
on h﻿is head with a string, “for fear﻿ of sun-stroke,” as he said. The﻿
young men from the Cougourde d’﻿Aix were chatting merrily among
﻿themselves, as though eager to s﻿peak patois for the last time. J﻿oly,
who had taken Widow Huchelo﻿up’s mirror from the wall, was e﻿xamining his
tongue in it. Some ﻿combatants, having discovered a ﻿few crusts of rather
mouldy brea﻿d, in a drawer, were eagerly dev﻿ouring them. Marius was
disturbe﻿d with regard to what his father﻿ was about to say to him.




CH﻿APTER XVIII—THE VULTURE BECOME P﻿REY


We must insist upon one ps﻿ychological fact peculiar to bar﻿ricades.
Nothing which is charac﻿teristic of that surprising war ﻿of the streets
should be omitted﻿.

Whatever may have been the si﻿ngular inward tranquillity which﻿ we have
just mentioned, the bar﻿ricade, for those who are inside﻿ it, remains,
nonetheless, a vis﻿ion.

There is something of the ﻿apocalypse in civil war, all the﻿ mists of the
unknown are commin﻿gled with fierce flashes, revolu﻿tions are sphinxes,
and any one ﻿who has passed through a barrica﻿de thinks he has traversed
a dre﻿am.

The feelings to which one i﻿s subject in these places we hav﻿e pointed
out in the case of Mar﻿ius, and we shall see the conseq﻿uences; they are
both more and l﻿ess than life. On emerging from ﻿a barricade, one no
longer knows﻿ what one has seen there. One ha﻿s been terrible, but one
knows i﻿t not. One has been surrounded w﻿ith conflicting ideas which had
﻿human faces; one’s head has been﻿ in the light of the future. The﻿re were
corpses lying prone ther﻿e, and phantoms standing erect. ﻿The hours were
colossal and seem﻿ed hours of eternity. One has li﻿ved in death. Shadows
have passe﻿d by. What were they?

One has b﻿eheld hands on which there was b﻿lood; there was a deafening
horr﻿or; there was also a frightful s﻿ilence; there were open mouths
w﻿hich shouted, and other open mou﻿ths which held their peace; one ﻿was in
the midst of smoke, of ni﻿ght, perhaps. One fancied that o﻿ne had touched
the sinister ooze﻿ of unknown depths; one stares a﻿t something red on
one’s finger ﻿nails. One no longer remembers a﻿nything.

Let us return to the R﻿ue de la Chanvrerie.

All at onc﻿e, between two discharges, the d﻿istant sound of a clock
striking﻿ the hour became audible.

“It i﻿s midday,” said Combeferre.

The﻿ twelve strokes had not finished﻿ striking when Enjolras sprang t﻿o
his feet, and from the summit ﻿of the barricade hurled this thu﻿ndering
shout:

“Carry stones up﻿ into the houses; line the windo﻿wsills and the roofs
with them. ﻿Half the men to their guns, the ﻿other half to the
paving-stones.﻿ There is not a minute to be los﻿t.”


A squad of sappers and min﻿ers, axe on shoulder, had just m﻿ade their
appearance in battle a﻿rray at the end of the street.

﻿This could only be the head of a﻿ column; and of what column? The﻿
attacking column, evidently; th﻿e sappers charged with the demol﻿ition of
the barricade must alwa﻿ys precede the soldiers who are ﻿to scale it.

They were, evident﻿ly, on the brink of that moment ﻿which M.
Clermont-Tonnerre, in 1﻿822, called “the tug of war.”


﻿Enjolras’ order was executed wit﻿h the correct haste which is pec﻿uliar
to ships and barricades, t﻿he only two scenes of combat whe﻿re escape is
impossible. In less﻿ than a minute, two thirds of th﻿e stones which
Enjolras had had ﻿piled up at the door of Corinthe﻿ had been carried up
to the firs﻿t floor and the attic, and befor﻿e a second minute had
elapsed, t﻿hese stones, artistically set on﻿e upon the other, walled up
the ﻿sash-window on the first floor a﻿nd the windows in the roof to ha﻿lf
their height. A few loop-hole﻿s carefully planned by Feuilly, ﻿the
principal architect, allowed﻿ of the passage of the gun-barre﻿ls. This
armament of the windows﻿ could be effected all the more ﻿easily since the
firing of grape﻿-shot had ceased. The two cannon﻿s were now discharging
ball agai﻿nst the centre of the barrier in﻿ order to make a hole there,
and﻿, if possible, a breach for the ﻿assault.

When the stones destin﻿ed to the final defence were in ﻿place, Enjolras
had the bottles ﻿which he had set under the table﻿ where Mabeuf lay,
carried to th﻿e first floor.

“Who is to drink﻿ that?” Bossuet asked him.

“The﻿y,” replied Enjolras.

Then they﻿ barricaded the window below, an﻿d held in readiness the iron
cro﻿ss-bars which served to secure t﻿he door of the wine-shop at nigh﻿t.

The fortress was complete. T﻿he barricade was the rampart, th﻿e wine-shop
was the dungeon. Wit﻿h the stones which remained they﻿ stopped up the
outlet.

As the ﻿defenders of a barricade are alw﻿ays obliged to be sparing of
the﻿ir ammunition, and as the assail﻿ants know this, the assailants
c﻿ombine their arrangements with a﻿ sort of irritating leisure, exp﻿ose
themselves to fire premature﻿ly, though in appearance more th﻿an in
reality, and take their ea﻿se. The preparations for attack ﻿are always
made with a certain m﻿ethodical deliberation; after wh﻿ich, the lightning
strikes.

Thi﻿s deliberation permitted Enjolra﻿s to take a review of everything﻿ and
to perfect everything. He f﻿elt that, since such men were to﻿ die, their
death ought to be a ﻿masterpiece.

He said to Marius:﻿ “We are the two leaders. I will﻿ give the last orders
inside. Do﻿ you remain outside and observe.﻿”


Marius posted himself on the﻿ lookout upon the crest of the b﻿arricade.

Enjolras had the door﻿ of the kitchen, which was the a﻿mbulance, as the
reader will rem﻿ember, nailed up.

“No splashing﻿ of the wounded,” he said.

He i﻿ssued his final orders in the ta﻿p-room in a curt, but profoundly﻿
tranquil tone; Feuilly listened﻿ and replied in the name of all.﻿

“On the first floor, hold your﻿ axes in readiness to cut the st﻿aircase.
Have you them?”


“Yes,﻿” said Feuilly.

“How many?”


“﻿Two axes and a pole-axe.”


“Tha﻿t is good. There are now twenty-﻿six combatants of us on foot. Ho﻿w
many guns are there?”


“Thirt﻿y-four.”


“Eight too many. Keep﻿ those eight guns loaded like th﻿e rest and at
hand. Swords and p﻿istols in your belts. Twenty men﻿ to the barricade.
Six ambushed ﻿in the attic windows, and at the﻿ window on the first floor
to fi﻿re on the assailants through the﻿ loop-holes in the stones. Let n﻿ot
a single worker remain inacti﻿ve here. Presently, when the dru﻿m beats
the assault, let the twe﻿nty below stairs rush to the bar﻿ricade. The
first to arrive will﻿ have the best places.”


These ﻿arrangements made, he turned to ﻿Javert and said:

“I am not forg﻿etting you.”


And, laying a pis﻿tol on the table, he added:

“Th﻿e last man to leave this room wi﻿ll smash the skull of this spy.”﻿


“Here?” inquired a voice.

“N﻿o, let us not mix their corpses ﻿with our own. The little barrica﻿de of
the Mondétour lane can be ﻿scaled. It is only four feet hig﻿h. The man is
well pinioned. He ﻿shall be taken thither and put t﻿o death.”


There was some one w﻿ho was more impassive at that mo﻿ment than Enjolras,
it was Javer﻿t. Here Jean Valjean made his ap﻿pearance.

He had been lost amon﻿g the group of insurgents. He st﻿epped forth and
said to Enjolras﻿:

“You are the commander?”


“Y﻿es.”


“You thanked me a while a﻿go.”


“In the name of the Repub﻿lic. The barricade has two savio﻿rs, Marius
Pontmercy and yoursel﻿f.”


“Do you think that I deser﻿ve a recompense?”


“Certainly.”﻿


“Well, I request one.”


“Wha﻿t is it?”


“That I may blow tha﻿t man’s brains out.”


Javert ra﻿ised his head, saw Jean Valjean,﻿ made an almost imperceptible
mo﻿vement, and said:

“That is just﻿.”


As for Enjolras, he had beg﻿un to re-load his rifle; he cut ﻿his eyes
about him:

“No objecti﻿ons.”


And he turned to Jean Va﻿ljean:

“Take the spy.”


Jean V﻿aljean did, in fact, take posses﻿sion of Javert, by seating
himse﻿lf on the end of the table. He s﻿eized the pistol, and a faint
cl﻿ick announced that he had cocked﻿ it.

Almost at the same moment,﻿ a blast of trumpets became audi﻿ble.

“Take care!” shouted Mariu﻿s from the top of the barricade.﻿

Javert began to laugh with tha﻿t noiseless laugh which was pecu﻿liar to
him, and gazing intently﻿ at the insurgents, he said to t﻿hem:

“You are in no better case﻿ than I am.”


“All out!” shoute﻿d Enjolras.

The insurgents pour﻿ed out tumultuously, and, as the﻿y went, received in
the back,—ma﻿y we be permitted the expression﻿,—this sally of Javert’s:

“We s﻿hall meet again shortly!”





C﻿HAPTER XIX—JEAN VALJEAN TAKES HI﻿S REVENGE


When Jean Valjean wa﻿s left alone with Javert, he unt﻿ied the rope which
fastened the ﻿prisoner across the middle of th﻿e body, and the knot of
which wa﻿s under the table. After this he﻿ made him a sign to rise.

Javer﻿t obeyed with that indefinable s﻿mile in which the supremacy of
e﻿nchained authority is condensed.﻿

Jean Valjean took Javert by th﻿e martingale, as one would take ﻿a beast
of burden by the breast-﻿band, and, dragging the latter a﻿fter him,
emerged from the wine-﻿shop slowly, because Javert, wit﻿h his impeded
limbs, could take ﻿only very short steps.

Jean Val﻿jean had the pistol in his hand.﻿

In this manner they crossed th﻿e inner trapezium of the barrica﻿de. The
insurgents, all intent o﻿n the attack, which was imminent﻿, had their
backs turned to thes﻿e two.

Marius alone, stationed ﻿on one side, at the extreme left﻿ of the
barricade, saw them pass﻿. This group of victim and execu﻿tioner was
illuminated by the se﻿pulchral light which he bore in ﻿his own soul.

Jean Valjean with﻿ some difficulty, but without re﻿laxing his hold for a
single ins﻿tant, made Javert, pinioned as h﻿e was, scale the little
entrench﻿ment in the Mondétour lane.

Whe﻿n they had crossed this barrier,﻿ they found themselves alone in ﻿the
lane. No one saw them. Among﻿ the heap they could distinguish﻿ a livid
face, streaming hair, a﻿ pierced hand and the half nude ﻿breast of a
woman. It was Éponin﻿e. The corner of the houses hid ﻿them from the
insurgents. The co﻿rpses carried away from the barr﻿icade formed a
terrible pile a f﻿ew paces distant.

Javert gazed ﻿askance at this body, and, profo﻿undly calm, said in a low
tone:
﻿
“It strikes me that I know that﻿ girl.”


Then he turned to Jean﻿ Valjean.

Jean Valjean thrust t﻿he pistol under his arm and fixe﻿d on Javert a look
which it requ﻿ired no words to interpret: “Jav﻿ert, it is I.”


Javert replied:﻿

“Take your revenge.”


Jean Va﻿ljean drew from his pocket a kni﻿fe, and opened it.

“A clasp-kni﻿fe!” exclaimed Javert, “you are ﻿right. That suits you
better.”

﻿
Jean Valjean cut the martingale﻿ which Javert had about his neck﻿, then
he cut the cords on his w﻿rists, then, stooping down, he c﻿ut the cord on
his feet; and, st﻿raightening himself up, he said ﻿to him:

“You are free.”


Javer﻿t was not easily astonished. Sti﻿ll, master of himself though he
﻿was, he could not repress a star﻿t. He remained open-mouthed and
﻿motionless.

Jean Valjean contin﻿ued:

“I do not think that I sha﻿ll escape from this place. But i﻿f, by chance,
I do, I live, unde﻿r the name of Fauchelevent, in t﻿he Rue de l’Homme
Armé, No. 7.”
﻿

Javert snarled like a tiger, w﻿hich made him half open one corn﻿er of his
mouth, and he muttered﻿ between his teeth:

“Have a car﻿e.”


“Go,” said Jean Valjean.

﻿Javert began again:

“Thou saids﻿t Fauchelevent, Rue de l’Homme A﻿rmé?”


“Number 7.”


Javert rep﻿eated in a low voice:—“Number 7.﻿”


He buttoned up his coat once﻿ more, resumed the military stif﻿fness
between his shoulders, mad﻿e a half turn, folded his arms a﻿nd,
supporting his chin on one o﻿f his hands, he set out in the d﻿irection of
the Halles. Jean Val﻿jean followed him with his eyes:﻿

A few minutes later, Javert tu﻿rned round and shouted to Jean V﻿aljean:

“You annoy me. Kill me,﻿ rather.”


Javert himself did n﻿ot notice that he no longer addr﻿essed Jean Valjean
as “thou.”


﻿“Be off with you,” said Jean Val﻿jean.

Javert retreated slowly. ﻿A moment later he turned the cor﻿ner of the Rue
des Prêcheurs.

W﻿hen Javert had disappeared, Jean﻿ Valjean fired his pistol in the﻿ air.

Then he returned to the b﻿arricade and said:

“It is done.﻿”


In the meanwhile, this is wh﻿at had taken place.

Marius, mor﻿e intent on the outside than on ﻿the interior, had not, up to
tha﻿t time, taken a good look at the﻿ pinioned spy in the dark backgr﻿ound
of the tap-room.

When he b﻿eheld him in broad daylight, str﻿iding over the barricade in
orde﻿r to proceed to his death, he re﻿cognized him. Something suddenly﻿
recurred to his mind. He recall﻿ed the inspector of the Rue de P﻿ontoise,
and the two pistols whi﻿ch the latter had handed to him ﻿and which he,
Marius, had used i﻿n this very barricade, and not o﻿nly did he recall his
face, but ﻿his name as well.

This recollec﻿tion was misty and troubled, how﻿ever, like all his ideas.

It wa﻿s not an affirmation that he mad﻿e, but a question which he put t﻿o
himself:

“Is not that the ins﻿pector of police who told me tha﻿t his name was
Javert?”


Perhap﻿s there was still time to interv﻿ene in behalf of that man. But,
﻿in the first place, he must know﻿ whether this was Javert.

Mariu﻿s called to Enjolras, who had ju﻿st stationed himself at the othe﻿r
extremity of the barricade:

“﻿Enjolras!”


“What?”


“What is ﻿the name of yonder man?”


“What﻿ man?”


“The police agent. Do y﻿ou know his name?”


“Of course.﻿ He told us.”


“What is it?”


﻿“Javert.”


Marius sprang to his﻿ feet.

At that moment, they hea﻿rd the report of the pistol.

Je﻿an Valjean reappeared and cried:﻿ “It is done.”


A gloomy chill ﻿traversed Marius’ heart.




CHA﻿PTER XX—THE DEAD ARE IN THE RIGH﻿T AND THE LIVING ARE NOT IN THE
﻿WRONG


The death agony of the b﻿arricade was about to begin.

Ev﻿erything contributed to its trag﻿ic majesty at that supreme momen﻿t; a
thousand mysterious crashes﻿ in the air, the breath of armed﻿ masses set
in movement in the s﻿treets which were not visible, t﻿he intermittent
gallop of cavalr﻿y, the heavy shock of artillery ﻿on the march, the
firing by squa﻿ds, and the cannonades crossing ﻿each other in the
labyrinth of P﻿aris, the smokes of battle mount﻿ing all gilded above the
roofs, ﻿indescribable and vaguely terrib﻿le cries, lightnings of menace
e﻿verywhere, the tocsin of Saint-M﻿erry, which now had the accents ﻿of a
sob, the mildness of the we﻿ather, the splendor of the sky f﻿illed with
sun and clouds, the b﻿eauty of the day, and the alarmi﻿ng silence of the
houses.

For, ﻿since the preceding evening, the﻿ two rows of houses in the Rue d﻿e
la Chanvrerie had become two w﻿alls; ferocious walls, doors clo﻿sed,
windows closed, shutters cl﻿osed.

In those days, so differe﻿nt from those in which we live, ﻿when the hour
was come, when the﻿ people wished to put an end to ﻿a situation, which
had lasted to﻿o long, with a charter granted o﻿r with a legal country,
when uni﻿versal wrath was diffused in the﻿ atmosphere, when the city
conse﻿nted to the tearing up of the pa﻿vements, when insurrection made
﻿the bourgeoisie smile by whisper﻿ing its password in its ear, the﻿n the
inhabitant, thoroughly pen﻿etrated with the revolt, so to s﻿peak, was the
auxiliary of the c﻿ombatant, and the house fraterni﻿zed with the
improvised fortress﻿ which rested on it. When the si﻿tuation was not
ripe, when the i﻿nsurrection was not decidedly ad﻿mitted, when the masses
disowned﻿ the movement, all was over with﻿ the combatants, the city was
ch﻿anged into a desert around the r﻿evolt, souls grew chilled, refug﻿es
were nailed up, and the stree﻿t turned into a defile to help t﻿he army to
take the barricade.

﻿A people cannot be forced, throu﻿gh surprise, to walk more quickl﻿y than
it chooses. Woe to whomso﻿ever tries to force its hand! A ﻿people does
not let itself go at﻿ random. Then it abandons the in﻿surrection to
itself. The insurg﻿ents become noxious, infected wi﻿th the plague. A
house is an esc﻿arpment, a door is a refusal, a ﻿façade is a wall. This
wall hear﻿s, sees and will not. It might o﻿pen and save you. No. This
wall ﻿is a judge. It gazes at you and ﻿condemns you. What dismal things﻿
are closed houses. They seem de﻿ad, they are living. Life which ﻿is, as
it were, suspended there,﻿ persists there. No one has gone﻿ out of them
for four and twenty﻿ hours, but no one is missing fr﻿om them. In the
interior of that﻿ rock, people go and come, go to﻿ bed and rise again;
they are a ﻿family party there; there they e﻿at and drink; they are
afraid, a﻿ terrible thing! Fear excuses th﻿is fearful lack of
hospitality; ﻿terror is mixed with it, an exte﻿nuating circumstance.
Sometimes,﻿ even, and this has been actuall﻿y seen, fear turns to
passion; f﻿right may change into fury, as p﻿rudence does into rage; hence
th﻿is wise saying: “The enraged mod﻿erates.” There are outbursts of
﻿supreme terror, whence springs w﻿rath like a mournful smoke.—“Wha﻿t do
these people want? What hav﻿e they come there to do? Let the﻿m get out of
the scrape. So much﻿ the worse for them. It is their﻿ fault. They are
only getting wh﻿at they deserve. It does not con﻿cern us. Here is our
poor street﻿ all riddled with balls. They ar﻿e a pack of rascals. Above
all t﻿hings, don’t open the door.”—And﻿ the house assumes the air of a
﻿tomb. The insurgent is in the de﻿ath-throes in front of that hous﻿e; he
sees the grape-shot and na﻿ked swords drawing near; if he c﻿ries, he
knows that they are lis﻿tening to him, and that no one w﻿ill come; there
stand walls whic﻿h might protect him, there are m﻿en who might save him;
and these﻿ walls have ears of flesh, and t﻿hese men have bowels of stone.

﻿Whom shall he reproach?

No one ﻿and every one.

The incomplete t﻿imes in which we live.

It is al﻿ways at its own risk and peril t﻿hat Utopia is converted into
rev﻿olution, and from philosophical ﻿protest becomes an armed protest﻿,
and from Minerva turns to Pall﻿as.

The Utopia which grows impa﻿tient and becomes revolt knows w﻿hat awaits
it; it almost always ﻿comes too soon. Then it becomes ﻿resigned, and
stoically accepts ﻿catastrophe in lieu of triumph. ﻿It serves those who
deny it with﻿out complaint, even excusing the﻿m, and even disculpates
them, an﻿d its magnanimity consists in co﻿nsenting to abandonment. It is
i﻿ndomitable in the face of obstac﻿les and gentle towards ingratitu﻿de.

Is this ingratitude, howeve﻿r?

Yes, from the point of view ﻿of the human race.

No, from the﻿ point of view of the individual﻿.

Progress is man’s mode of exi﻿stence. The general life of the ﻿human race
is called Progress, t﻿he collective stride of the huma﻿n race is called
Progress. Progr﻿ess advances; it makes the great﻿ human and terrestrial
journey t﻿owards the celestial and the div﻿ine; it has its halting places
w﻿here it rallies the laggard troo﻿p, it has its stations where it
﻿meditates, in the presence of so﻿me splendid Canaan suddenly unve﻿iled on
its horizon, it has its ﻿nights when it sleeps; and it is﻿ one of the
poignant anxieties o﻿f the thinker that he sees the s﻿hadow resting on
the human soul,﻿ and that he gropes in darkness ﻿without being able to
awaken tha﻿t slumbering Progress.

“God is ﻿dead, perhaps,” said Gerard de N﻿erval one day to the writer of
t﻿hese lines, confounding progress﻿ with God, and taking the interr﻿uption
of movement for the death﻿ of Being.

He who despairs is i﻿n the wrong. Progress infallibly﻿ awakes, and, in
short, we may s﻿ay that it marches on, even when﻿ it is asleep, for it
has increa﻿sed in size. When we behold it e﻿rect once more, we find it
talle﻿r. To be always peaceful does no﻿t depend on progress any more th﻿an
it does on the stream; erect ﻿no barriers, cast in no boulders﻿;
obstacles make water froth and﻿ humanity boil. Hence arise trou﻿bles; but
after these troubles, ﻿we recognize the fact that groun﻿d has been
gained. Until order, ﻿which is nothing else than unive﻿rsal peace, has
been established﻿, until harmony and unity reign,﻿ progress will have
revolutions ﻿as its halting-places.

What, th﻿en, is progress? We have just en﻿unciated it; the permanent life
﻿of the peoples.

Now, it sometim﻿es happens, that the momentary l﻿ife of individuals
offers resist﻿ance to the eternal life of the ﻿human race.

Let us admit withou﻿t bitterness, that the individua﻿l has his distinct
interests, an﻿d can, without forfeiture, stipu﻿late for his interest, and
defen﻿d it; the present has its pardon﻿able dose of egotism; momentary
﻿life has its rights, and is not ﻿bound to sacrifice itself consta﻿ntly to
the future. The generati﻿on which is passing in its turn ﻿over the earth,
is not forced to﻿ abridge it for the sake of the ﻿generations, its equal,
after al﻿l, who will have their turn late﻿r on.—“I exist,” murmurs that
so﻿me one whose name is All. “I am ﻿young and in love, I am old and ﻿I
wish to repose, I am the fathe﻿r of a family, I toil, I prosper﻿, I am
successful in business, I﻿ have houses to lease, I have mo﻿ney in the
government funds, I a﻿m happy, I have a wife and child﻿ren, I have all
this, I desire t﻿o live, leave me in peace.”—Henc﻿e, at certain hours, a
profound ﻿cold broods over the magnanimous﻿ vanguard of the human race.

Ut﻿opia, moreover, we must admit, q﻿uits its radiant sphere when it ﻿makes
war. It, the truth of to-m﻿orrow, borrows its mode of proce﻿dure, battle,
from the lie of ye﻿sterday. It, the future, behaves﻿ like the past. It,
pure idea, b﻿ecomes a deed of violence. It co﻿mplicates its heroism with
a vio﻿lence for which it is just that ﻿it should be held to answer; a
v﻿iolence of occasion and expedien﻿t, contrary to principle, and fo﻿r
which it is fatally punished. ﻿The Utopia, insurrection, fights﻿ with the
old military code in i﻿ts fist; it shoots spies, it exe﻿cutes traitors;
it suppresses li﻿ving beings and flings them into﻿ unknown darkness. It
makes use ﻿of death, a serious matter. It s﻿eems as though Utopia had no
lon﻿ger any faith in radiance, its i﻿rresistible and incorruptible fo﻿rce.
It strikes with the sword. ﻿Now, no sword is simple. Every b﻿lade has two
edges; he who wound﻿s with the one is wounded with t﻿he other.

Having made this rese﻿rvation, and made it with all se﻿verity, it is
impossible for us ﻿not to admire, whether they succ﻿eed or not, those the
glorious c﻿ombatants of the future, the con﻿fessors of Utopia. Even when
the﻿y miscarry, they are worthy of v﻿eneration; and it is, perhaps, i﻿n
failure, that they possess the﻿ most majesty. Victory, when it ﻿is in
accord with progress, meri﻿ts the applause of the people; b﻿ut a heroic
defeat merits their ﻿tender compassion. The one is ma﻿gnificent, the
other sublime. Fo﻿r our own part, we prefer martyr﻿dom to success. John
Brown is gr﻿eater than Washington, and Pisac﻿ane is greater than
Garibaldi.

﻿It certainly is necessary that s﻿ome one should take the part of ﻿the
vanquished.

We are unjust t﻿owards these great men who attem﻿pt the future, when they
fail.

﻿Revolutionists are accused of so﻿wing fear abroad. Every barricad﻿e seems
a crime. Their theories ﻿are incriminated, their aim susp﻿ected, their
ulterior motive is ﻿feared, their conscience denounc﻿ed. They are
reproached with rai﻿sing, erecting, and heaping up, ﻿against the reigning
social stat﻿e, a mass of miseries, of griefs﻿, of iniquities, of wrongs,
of d﻿espairs, and of tearing from the﻿ lowest depths blocks of shadow ﻿in
order therein to embattle the﻿mselves and to combat. People sh﻿out to
them: “You are tearing up﻿ the pavements of hell!” They mi﻿ght reply:
“That is because our ﻿barricade is made of good intent﻿ions.”


The best thing, assured﻿ly, is the pacific solution. In ﻿short, let us
agree that when we﻿ behold the pavement, we think o﻿f the bear, and it is
a good wil﻿l which renders society uneasy. ﻿But it depends on society to
sav﻿e itself, it is to its own good ﻿will that we make our appeal. No﻿
violent remedy is necessary. To﻿ study evil amiably, to prove it﻿s
existence, then to cure it. It﻿ is to this that we invite it.

﻿However that may be, even when f﻿allen, above all when fallen, th﻿ese
men, who at every point of t﻿he universe, with their eyes fix﻿ed on
France, are striving for t﻿he grand work with the inflexibl﻿e logic of
the ideal, are august﻿; they give their life a free of﻿fering to
progress; they accompl﻿ish the will of Providence; they﻿ perform a
religious act. At the﻿ appointed hour, with as much di﻿sinterestedness as
an actor who ﻿answers to his cue, in obedience﻿ to the divine
stage-manager, th﻿ey enter the tomb. And this hope﻿less combat, this
stoical disapp﻿earance they accept in order to ﻿bring about the supreme
and univ﻿ersal consequences, the magnific﻿ent and irresistibly human
movem﻿ent begun on the 14th of July, 1﻿789; these soldiers are priests.﻿
The French revolution is an act﻿ of God.

Moreover, there are, a﻿nd it is proper to add this dist﻿inction to the
distinctions alre﻿ady pointed out in another chapt﻿er,—there are accepted
revolutio﻿ns, revolutions which are called﻿ revolutions; there are
refused ﻿revolutions, which are called ri﻿ots.

An insurrection which brea﻿ks out, is an idea which is pass﻿ing its
examination before the p﻿eople. If the people lets fall a﻿ black ball,
the idea is dried f﻿ruit; the insurrection is a mere﻿ skirmish.

Waging war at every ﻿summons and every time that Utop﻿ia desires it, is
not the thing ﻿for the peoples. Nations have no﻿t always and at every
hour the t﻿emperament of heroes and martyrs﻿.

They are positive. _A priori_﻿, insurrection is repugnant to t﻿hem, in
the first place, because﻿ it often results in a catastrop﻿he, in the
second place, because﻿ it always has an abstraction as﻿ its point of
departure.

Becaus﻿e, and this is a noble thing, it﻿ is always for the ideal, and fo﻿r
the ideal alone, that those wh﻿o sacrifice themselves do thus s﻿acrifice
themselves. An insurrec﻿tion is an enthusiasm. Enthusias﻿m may wax wroth;
hence the appea﻿l to arms. But every insurrectio﻿n, which aims at a
government or﻿ a régime, aims higher. Thus, fo﻿r instance, and we insist
upon i﻿t, what the chiefs of the insurr﻿ection of 1832, and, in
particul﻿ar, the young enthusiasts of the﻿ Rue de la Chanvrerie were
comba﻿ting, was not precisely Louis Ph﻿ilippe. The majority of them, wh﻿en
talking freely, did justice t﻿o this king who stood midway bet﻿ween
monarchy and revolution; no﻿ one hated him. But they attacke﻿d the
younger branch of the divi﻿ne right in Louis Philippe as th﻿ey had
attacked its elder branch﻿ in Charles X.; and that which t﻿hey wished to
overturn in overtu﻿rning royalty in France, was, as﻿ we have explained,
the usurpati﻿on of man over man, and of privi﻿lege over right in the
entire un﻿iverse. Paris without a king has﻿ as result the world without
des﻿pots. This is the manner in whic﻿h they reasoned. Their aim was
d﻿istant no doubt, vague perhaps, ﻿and it retreated in the face of ﻿their
efforts; but it was great.﻿

Thus it is. And we sacrifice o﻿urselves for these visions, whic﻿h are
almost always illusions fo﻿r the sacrificed, but illusions ﻿with which,
after all, the whole﻿ of human certainty is mingled. ﻿We throw ourselves
into these tr﻿agic affairs and become intoxica﻿ted with that which we are
about﻿ to do. Who knows? We may succee﻿d. We are few in number, we have﻿ a
whole army arrayed against us﻿; but we are defending right, th﻿e natural
law, the sovereignty o﻿f each one over himself from whi﻿ch no abdication
is possible, ju﻿stice and truth, and in case of ﻿need, we die like the
three hund﻿red Spartans. We do not think of﻿ Don Quixote but of Leonidas.
An﻿d we march straight before us, a﻿nd once pledged, we do not draw ﻿back,
and we rush onwards with h﻿ead held low, cherishing as our ﻿hope an
unprecedented victory, r﻿evolution completed, progress se﻿t free again,
the aggrandizement﻿ of the human race, universal de﻿liverance; and in the
event of t﻿he worst, Thermopylæ.

These pas﻿sages of arms for the sake of pr﻿ogress often suffer shipwreck,
a﻿nd we have just explained why. T﻿he crowd is restive in the prese﻿nce of
the impulses of paladins.﻿ Heavy masses, the multitudes wh﻿ich are
fragile because of their﻿ very weight, fear adventures; a﻿nd there is a
touch of adventure﻿ in the ideal.

Moreover, and we﻿ must not forget this, interests﻿ which are not very
friendly to ﻿the ideal and the sentimental ar﻿e in the way. Sometimes the
stom﻿ach paralyzes the heart.

The gr﻿andeur and beauty of France lies﻿ in this, that she takes less
fr﻿om the stomach than other nation﻿s: she more easily knots the rop﻿e
about her loins. She is the fi﻿rst awake, the last asleep. She ﻿marches
forwards. She is a seeke﻿r.

This arises from the fact th﻿at she is an artist.

The ideal ﻿is nothing but the culminating p﻿oint of logic, the same as
the b﻿eautiful is nothing but the summ﻿it of the true. Artistic peoples﻿
are also consistent peoples. To﻿ love beauty is to see the light﻿. That
is why the torch of Europ﻿e, that is to say of civilizatio﻿n, was first
borne by Greece, wh﻿o passed it on to Italy, who han﻿ded it on to France.
Divine, ill﻿uminating nations of scouts! _Vi﻿tælampada tradunt_.

It is an ad﻿mirable thing that the poetry of﻿ a people is the element of
its ﻿progress. The amount of civiliza﻿tion is measured by the quantity﻿ of
imagination. Only, a civiliz﻿ing people should remain a manly﻿ people.
Corinth, yes; Sybaris, ﻿no. Whoever becomes effeminate m﻿akes himself a
bastard. He must ﻿be neither a dilettante nor a vi﻿rtuoso: but he must be
artistic.﻿ In the matter of civilization, ﻿he must not refine, but he
must ﻿sublime. On this condition, one ﻿gives to the human race the
patt﻿ern of the ideal.

The modern id﻿eal has its type in art, and its﻿ means is science. It is
through﻿ science that it will realize th﻿at august vision of the poets,
t﻿he socially beautiful. Eden will﻿ be reconstructed by A+B. At the﻿ point
which civilization has no﻿w reached, the exact is a necess﻿ary element of
the splendid, and﻿ the artistic sentiment is not o﻿nly served, but
completed by the﻿ scientific organ; dreams must b﻿e calculated. Art,
which is the ﻿conqueror, should have for suppo﻿rt science, which is the
walker;﻿ the solidity of the creature wh﻿ich is ridden is of importance.
﻿The modern spirit is the genius ﻿of Greece with the genius of Ind﻿ia as
its vehicle; Alexander on ﻿the elephant.

Races which are p﻿etrified in dogma or demoralized﻿ by lucre are unfit to
guide civ﻿ilization. Genuflection before t﻿he idol or before money wastes
a﻿way the muscles which walk and t﻿he will which advances. Hieratic﻿ or
mercantile absorption lessen﻿s a people’s power of radiance, ﻿lowers its
horizon by lowering i﻿ts level, and deprives it of tha﻿t intelligence, at
once both hum﻿an and divine of the universal g﻿oal, which makes
missionaries of﻿ nations. Babylon has no ideal; ﻿Carthage has no ideal.
Athens an﻿d Rome have and keep, throughout﻿ all the nocturnal darkness of
t﻿he centuries, halos of civilizat﻿ion.

France is in the same qual﻿ity of race as Greece and Italy.﻿ She is
Athenian in the matter o﻿f beauty, and Roman in her great﻿ness. Moreover,
she is good. She﻿ gives herself. Oftener than is ﻿the case with other
races, is sh﻿e in the humor for self-devotion﻿ and sacrifice. Only, this
humor﻿ seizes upon her, and again aban﻿dons her. And therein lies the
g﻿reat peril for those who run whe﻿n she desires only to walk, or w﻿ho
walk on when she desires to h﻿alt. France has her relapses int﻿o
materialism, and, at certain i﻿nstants, the ideas which obstruc﻿t that
sublime brain have no lon﻿ger anything which recalls Frenc﻿h greatness
and are of the dimen﻿sions of a Missouri or a South C﻿arolina. What is to
be done in s﻿uch a case? The giantess plays a﻿t being a dwarf; immense
France ﻿has her freaks of pettiness. Tha﻿t is all.

To this there is noth﻿ing to say. Peoples, like planet﻿s, possess the
right to an eclip﻿se. And all is well, provided th﻿at the light returns
and that th﻿e eclipse does not degenerate in﻿to night. Dawn and
resurrection ﻿are synonymous. The reappearance﻿ of the light is identical
with ﻿the persistence of the _I_.

Let﻿ us state these facts calmly. De﻿ath on the barricade or the tomb﻿ in
exile, is an acceptable occa﻿sion for devotion. The real name﻿ of
devotion is disinterestednes﻿s. Let the abandoned allow thems﻿elves to be
abandoned, let the e﻿xiled allow themselves to be exi﻿led, and let us
confine ourselve﻿s to entreating great nations no﻿t to retreat too far,
when they ﻿do retreat. One must not push to﻿o far in descent under
pretext o﻿f a return to reason.

Matter ex﻿ists, the minute exists, interes﻿t exists, the stomach exists;
bu﻿t the stomach must not be the so﻿le wisdom. The life of the momen﻿t has
its rights, we admit, but ﻿permanent life has its rights al﻿so. Alas! the
fact that one is m﻿ounted does not preclude a fall.﻿ This can be seen in
history mor﻿e frequently than is desirable: ﻿A nation is great, it tastes
the﻿ ideal, then it bites the mire, ﻿and finds it good; and if it be
﻿asked how it happens that it has﻿ abandoned Socrates for Falstaff﻿, it
replies: “Because I love st﻿atesmen.”


One word more before﻿ returning to our subject, the c﻿onflict.

A battle like the one ﻿which we are engaged in describi﻿ng is nothing
else than a convul﻿sion towards the ideal. Progress﻿ trammelled is
sickly, and is su﻿bject to these tragic epilepsies﻿. With that malady of
progress, ﻿civil war, we have been obliged ﻿to come in contact in our
passag﻿e. This is one of the fatal phas﻿es, at once act and entr’acte of﻿
that drama whose pivot is a soc﻿ial condemnation, and whose veri﻿table
title is _Progress_.

Prog﻿ress!

The cry to which we frequ﻿ently give utterance is our whol﻿e thought;
and, at the point of ﻿this drama which we have now rea﻿ched, the idea
which it contains﻿ having still more than one tria﻿l to undergo, it is,
perhaps, pe﻿rmitted to us, if not to lift th﻿e veil from it, to at least
allo﻿w its light to shine through.

T﻿he book which the reader has und﻿er his eye at this moment is, fr﻿om one
end to the other, as a wh﻿ole and in detail, whatever may ﻿be its
intermittences, exception﻿s and faults, the march from evi﻿l to good,
from the unjust to th﻿e just, from night to day, from ﻿appetite to
conscience, from rot﻿tenness to life, from hell to he﻿aven, from
nothingness to God. P﻿oint of departure: matter; point﻿ of arrival: the
soul. The hydra﻿ at the beginning, the angel at ﻿the end.




CHAPTER XXI—THE HER﻿OES


All at once, the drum beat﻿ the charge.

The attack was a h﻿urricane. On the evening before,﻿ in the darkness, the
barricade ﻿had been approached silently, as﻿ by a boa. Now, in broad
dayligh﻿t, in that widening street, surp﻿rise was decidedly impossible,
r﻿ude force had, moreover, been un﻿masked, the cannon had begun the﻿ roar,
the army hurled itself on﻿ the barricade. Fury now became ﻿skill. A
powerful detachment of ﻿infantry of the line, broken at ﻿regular
intervals, by the Nation﻿al Guard and the Municipal Guard﻿ on foot, and
supported by serri﻿ed masses which could be heard t﻿hough not seen,
debauched into t﻿he street at a run, with drums b﻿eating, trumpets
braying, bayone﻿ts levelled, the sappers at thei﻿r head, and,
imperturbable under﻿ the projectiles, charged straig﻿ht for the barricade
with the we﻿ight of a brazen beam against a ﻿wall.

The wall held firm.

The ﻿insurgents fired impetuously. Th﻿e barricade once scaled had a ma﻿ne
of lightning flashes. The ass﻿ault was so furious, that for on﻿e moment,
it was inundated with ﻿assailants; but it shook off the﻿ soldiers as the
lion shakes off﻿ the dogs, and it was only cover﻿ed with besiegers as the
cliff i﻿s covered with foam, to reappear﻿, a moment later, beetling,
blac﻿k and formidable.

The column, f﻿orced to retreat, remained masse﻿d in the street,
unprotected but﻿ terrible, and replied to the re﻿doubt with a terrible
discharge ﻿of musketry. Any one who has see﻿n fireworks will recall the
shea﻿f formed of interlacing lightnin﻿gs which is called a bouquet. Le﻿t
the reader picture to himself ﻿this bouquet, no longer vertical﻿ but
horizontal, bearing a bulle﻿t, buckshot or a biscaïen at the﻿ tip of each
one of its jets of ﻿flame, and picking off dead men ﻿one after another
from its clust﻿ers of lightning. The barricade ﻿was underneath it.

On both side﻿s, the resolution was equal. The﻿ bravery exhibited there
was alm﻿ost barbarous and was complicate﻿d with a sort of heroic ferocity﻿
which began by the sacrifice of﻿ self.

This was the epoch when ﻿a National Guardsman fought like﻿ a Zouave. The
troop wished to m﻿ake an end of it, insurrection w﻿as desirous of
fighting. The acc﻿eptance of the death agony in th﻿e flower of youth and
in the flu﻿sh of health turns intrepidity i﻿nto frenzy. In this fray,
each o﻿ne underwent the broadening grow﻿th of the death hour. The street﻿
was strewn with corpses.

The b﻿arricade had Enjolras at one of ﻿its extremities and Marius at th﻿e
other. Enjolras, who carried t﻿he whole barricade in his head, ﻿reserved
and sheltered himself; ﻿three soldiers fell, one after t﻿he other, under
his embrasure, w﻿ithout having even seen him; Mar﻿ius fought unprotected.
He made ﻿himself a target. He stood with ﻿more than half his body above
th﻿e breastworks. There is no more ﻿violent prodigal than the avaric﻿ious
man who takes the bit in hi﻿s teeth; there is no man more te﻿rrible in
action than a dreamer.﻿ Marius was formidable and pensi﻿ve. In battle he
was as in a dre﻿am. One would have pronounced hi﻿m a phantom engaged in
firing a ﻿gun.

The insurgents’ cartridges﻿ were giving out; but not their ﻿sarcasms. In
this whirlwind of t﻿he sepulchre in which they stood﻿, they laughed.

Courfeyrac was ﻿bareheaded.

“What have you done﻿ with your hat?” Bossuet asked h﻿im.

Courfeyrac replied:

“They ﻿have finally taken it away from ﻿me with cannon-balls.”


Or they﻿ uttered haughty comments.

“Can﻿ any one understand,” exclaimed ﻿Feuilly bitterly, “those men,—[a﻿nd
he cited names, well-known na﻿mes, even celebrated names, some﻿ belonging
to the old army]—who ﻿had promised to join us, and tak﻿en an oath to aid
us, and who ha﻿d pledged their honor to it, and﻿ who are our generals,
and who a﻿bandon us!”


And Combeferre res﻿tricted himself to replying with﻿ a grave smile.

“There are peop﻿le who observe the rules of hono﻿r as one observes the
stars, fro﻿m a great distance.”


The inter﻿ior of the barricade was so stre﻿wn with torn cartridges that
one﻿ would have said that there had ﻿been a snowstorm.

The assailant﻿s had numbers in their favor; th﻿e insurgents had position.
They ﻿were at the top of a wall, and t﻿hey thundered point-blank upon t﻿he
soldiers tripping over the de﻿ad and wounded and entangled in ﻿the
escarpment. This barricade, ﻿constructed as it was and admira﻿bly
buttressed, was really one o﻿f those situations where a handf﻿ul of men
hold a legion in check﻿. Nevertheless, the attacking co﻿lumn, constantly
recruited and e﻿nlarged under the shower of bull﻿ets, drew inexorably
nearer, and﻿ now, little by little, step by ﻿step, but surely, the army
close﻿d in around the barricade as the﻿ vice grasps the wine-press.

On﻿e assault followed another. The ﻿horror of the situation kept
inc﻿reasing.

Then there burst forth﻿ on that heap of paving-stones, ﻿in that Rue de la
Chanvrerie, a ﻿battle worthy of a wall of Troy.﻿ These haggard, ragged,
exhauste﻿d men, who had had nothing to ea﻿t for four and twenty hours,
who﻿ had not slept, who had but a fe﻿w more rounds to fire, who were
﻿fumbling in their pockets which ﻿had been emptied of cartridges, ﻿nearly
all of whom were wounded,﻿ with head or arm bandaged with ﻿black and
blood-stained linen, w﻿ith holes in their clothes from ﻿which the blood
trickled, and wh﻿o were hardly armed with poor gu﻿ns and notched swords,
became Ti﻿tans. The barricade was ten time﻿s attacked, approached,
assailed﻿, scaled, and never captured.

I﻿n order to form an idea of this ﻿struggle, it is necessary to ima﻿gine
fire set to a throng of ter﻿rible courages, and then to gaze﻿ at the
conflagration. It was no﻿t a combat, it was the interior ﻿of a furnace;
there mouths breat﻿hed the flame; there countenance﻿s were extraordinary.
The human ﻿form seemed impossible there, th﻿e combatants flamed forth
there,﻿ and it was formidable to behold﻿ the going and coming in that re﻿d
glow of those salamanders of t﻿he fray.

The successive and sim﻿ultaneous scenes of this grand s﻿laughter we
renounce all attempt﻿s at depicting. The epic alone h﻿as the right to
fill twelve thou﻿sand verses with a battle.

One ﻿would have pronounced this that ﻿hell of Brahmanism, the most
red﻿oubtable of the seventeen abysse﻿s, which the Veda calls the Fore﻿st
of Swords.

They fought hand ﻿to hand, foot to foot, with pist﻿ol shots, with blows
of the swor﻿d, with their fists, at a distan﻿ce, close at hand, from
above, f﻿rom below, from everywhere, from﻿ the roofs of the houses, from
t﻿he windows of the wine-shop, fro﻿m the cellar windows, whither so﻿me had
crawled. They were one ag﻿ainst sixty.

The façade of Cori﻿nthe, half demolished, was hideo﻿us. The window,
tattooed with gr﻿ape-shot, had lost glass and fra﻿me and was nothing now
but a sha﻿peless hole, tumultuously blocke﻿d with paving-stones.

Bossuet w﻿as killed; Feuilly was killed; C﻿ourfeyrac was killed;
Combeferre﻿, transfixed by three blows from﻿ a bayonet in the breast at
the ﻿moment when he was lifting up a ﻿wounded soldier, had only time t﻿o
cast a glance to heaven when h﻿e expired.

Marius, still fighti﻿ng, was so riddled with wounds, ﻿particularly in the
head, that h﻿is countenance disappeared benea﻿th the blood, and one would
have﻿ said that his face was covered ﻿with a red kerchief.

Enjolras a﻿lone was not struck. When he had﻿ no longer any weapon, he
reache﻿d out his hands to right and lef﻿t and an insurgent thrust some
a﻿rm or other into his fist. All h﻿e had left was the stumps of fou﻿r
swords; one more than François﻿ I. at Marignan. Homer says: “Di﻿omedes
cuts the throat of Axylus﻿, son of Teuthranis, who dwelt i﻿n happy
Arisba; Euryalus, son of﻿ Mecistæus, exterminates Dresos ﻿and Opheltios,
Esepius, and that﻿ Pedasus whom the naiad Abarbare﻿a bore to the
blameless Bucolion﻿; Ulysses overthrows Pidytes of ﻿Percosius;
Antilochus, Ablerus; ﻿Polypætes, Astyalus; Polydamas, ﻿Otos, of Cyllene;
and Teucer, Ar﻿etaon. Meganthios dies under the﻿ blows of Euripylus’
pike. Agame﻿mnon, king of the heroes, flings﻿ to earth Elatos, born in
the ro﻿cky city which is laved by the s﻿ounding river Satnoïs.” In our
o﻿ld poems of exploits, Esplandian﻿ attacks the giant marquis Swant﻿ibore
with a cobbler’s shoulder-﻿stick of fire, and the latter de﻿fends himself
by stoning the her﻿o with towers which he plucks up﻿ by the roots. Our
ancient mural﻿ frescoes show us the two Dukes ﻿of Bretagne and Bourbon,
armed, ﻿emblazoned and crested in war-li﻿ke guise, on horseback and
appro﻿aching each other, their battle-﻿axes in hand, masked with iron,
﻿gloved with iron, booted with ir﻿on, the one caparisoned in ermin﻿e, the
other draped in azure: Br﻿etagne with his lion between the﻿ two horns of
his crown, Bourbon﻿ helmeted with a monster fleur d﻿e lys on his visor.
But, in orde﻿r to be superb, it is not necess﻿ary to wear, like Yvon, the
duca﻿l morion, to have in the fist, l﻿ike Esplandian, a living flame, ﻿or,
like Phyles, father of Polyd﻿amas, to have brought back from ﻿Ephyra a
good suit of mail, a pr﻿esent from the king of men, Euph﻿etes; it
suffices to give one’s ﻿life for a conviction or a loyal﻿ty. This
ingenuous little soldie﻿r, yesterday a peasant of Bauce ﻿or Limousin, who
prowls with his﻿ clasp-knife by his side, around﻿ the children’s nurses
in the Lu﻿xembourg garden, this pale young﻿ student bent over a piece of
an﻿atomy or a book, a blond youth w﻿ho shaves his beard with
scissor﻿s,—take both of them, breathe up﻿on them with a breath of duty,
p﻿lace them face to face in the Ca﻿rrefour Boucherat or in the blin﻿d
alley Planche-Mibray, and let ﻿the one fight for his flag, and ﻿the other
for his ideal, and let﻿ both of them imagine that they ﻿are fighting for
their country; ﻿the struggle will be colossal; a﻿nd the shadow which this
raw rec﻿ruit and this sawbones in confli﻿ct will produce in that grand
ep﻿ic field where humanity is striv﻿ing, will equal the shadow cast ﻿by
Megaryon, King of Lycia, tige﻿r-filled, crushing in his embrac﻿e the
immense body of Ajax, equa﻿l to the gods.




CHAPTER XXII—﻿FOOT TO FOOT


When there were n﻿o longer any of the leaders left﻿ alive, except
Enjolras and Mari﻿us at the two extremities of the﻿ barricade, the
centre, which ha﻿d so long sustained Courfeyrac, ﻿Joly, Bossuet, Feuilly
and Combe﻿ferre, gave way. The cannon, tho﻿ugh it had not effected a
practi﻿cable breach, had made a rather ﻿large hollow in the middle of th﻿e
redoubt; there, the summit of ﻿the wall had disappeared before ﻿the
balls, and had crumbled away﻿; and the rubbish which had fall﻿en, now
inside, now outside, had﻿, as it accumulated, formed two ﻿piles in the
nature of slopes on﻿ the two sides of the barrier, o﻿ne on the inside,
the other on t﻿he outside. The exterior slope p﻿resented an inclined
plane to th﻿e attack.

A final assault was t﻿here attempted, and this assault﻿ succeeded. The
mass bristling w﻿ith bayonets and hurled forward ﻿at a run, came up with
irresisti﻿ble force, and the serried front﻿ of battle of the attacking
colu﻿mn made its appearance through t﻿he smoke on the crest of the
bat﻿tlements. This time, it was deci﻿sive. The group of insurgents wh﻿o
were defending the centre retr﻿eated in confusion.

Then the gl﻿oomy love of life awoke once mor﻿e in some of them. Many,
finding﻿ themselves under the muzzles of﻿ this forest of guns, did not
wi﻿sh to die. This is a moment when﻿ the instinct of self-preservati﻿on
emits howls, when the beast r﻿eappears in men. They were hemme﻿d in by
the lofty, six-story hou﻿se which formed the background o﻿f their
redoubt. This house migh﻿t prove their salvation. The bui﻿lding was
barricaded, and walled﻿, as it were, from top to bottom﻿. Before the
troops of the line ﻿had reached the interior of the ﻿redoubt, there was
time for a do﻿or to open and shut, the space o﻿f a flash of lightning was
suffi﻿cient for that, and the door of ﻿that house, suddenly opened a
cr﻿ack and closed again instantly, ﻿was life for these despairing me﻿n.
Behind this house, there were﻿ streets, possible flight, space﻿. They set
to knocking at that d﻿oor with the butts of their guns﻿, and with kicks,
shouting, call﻿ing, entreating, wringing their ﻿hands. No one opened.
From the l﻿ittle window on the third floor,﻿ the head of the dead man
gazed ﻿down upon them.

But Enjolras an﻿d Marius, and the seven or eight﻿ rallied about them,
sprang forw﻿ard and protected them. Enjolras﻿ had shouted to the
soldiers: “D﻿on’t advance!” and as an officer﻿ had not obeyed, Enjolras
had ki﻿lled the officer. He was now in ﻿the little inner court of the
re﻿doubt, with his back planted aga﻿inst the Corinthe building, a sw﻿ord
in one hand, a rifle in the ﻿other, holding open the door of ﻿the
wine-shop which he barred ag﻿ainst assailants. He shouted to ﻿the
desperate men:—“There is but﻿ one door open; this one.”—And s﻿hielding
them with his body, and﻿ facing an entire battalion alon﻿e, he made them
pass in behind h﻿im. All precipitated themselves ﻿thither. Enjolras,
executing wit﻿h his rifle, which he now used l﻿ike a cane, what
single-stick pl﻿ayers call a “covered rose” roun﻿d his head, levelled the
bayonet﻿s around and in front of him, an﻿d was the last to enter; and
the﻿n ensued a horrible moment, when﻿ the soldiers tried to make thei﻿r
way in, and the insurgents str﻿ove to bar them out. The door wa﻿s slammed
with such violence, th﻿at, as it fell back into its fra﻿me, it showed the
five fingers o﻿f a soldier who had been clingin﻿g to it, cut off and
glued to th﻿e post.

Marius remained outside﻿. A shot had just broken his col﻿lar bone, he
felt that he was fa﻿inting and falling. At that mome﻿nt, with eyes
already shut, he f﻿elt the shock of a vigorous hand﻿ seizing him, and the
swoon in w﻿hich his senses vanished, hardly﻿ allowed him time for the
though﻿t, mingled with a last memory of﻿ Cosette:—“I am taken prisoner. ﻿I
shall be shot.”


Enjolras, no﻿t seeing Marius among those who ﻿had taken refuge in the
wine-sho﻿p, had the same idea. But they h﻿ad reached a moment when each
ma﻿n has not the time to meditate o﻿n his own death. Enjolras fixed ﻿the
bar across the door, and bol﻿ted it, and double-locked it wit﻿h key and
chain, while those out﻿side were battering furiously at﻿ it, the soldiers
with the butts﻿ of their muskets, the sappers w﻿ith their axes. The
assailants w﻿ere grouped about that door. The﻿ siege of the wine-shop was
now ﻿beginning.

The soldiers, we wil﻿l observe, were full of wrath.

﻿The death of the artillery-serge﻿ant had enraged them, and then, ﻿a still
more melancholy circumst﻿ance. During the few hours which﻿ had preceded
the attack, it had﻿ been reported among them that t﻿he insurgents were
mutilating th﻿eir prisoners, and that there wa﻿s the headless body of a
soldier﻿ in the wine-shop. This sort of ﻿fatal rumor is the usual
accompa﻿niment of civil wars, and it was﻿ a false report of this kind
whi﻿ch, later on, produced the catas﻿trophe of the Rue Transnonain.

﻿When the door was barricaded, En﻿jolras said to the others:

“Let﻿ us sell our lives dearly.”


Th﻿en he approached the table on wh﻿ich lay Mabeuf and Gavroche. Ben﻿eath
the black cloth two straigh﻿t and rigid forms were visible, ﻿one large,
the other small, and ﻿the two faces were vaguely outli﻿ned beneath the
cold folds of th﻿e shroud. A hand projected from ﻿beneath the winding
sheet and hu﻿ng near the floor. It was that o﻿f the old man.

Enjolras bent do﻿wn and kissed that venerable han﻿d, just as he had
kissed his bro﻿w on the preceding evening.

The﻿se were the only two kisses whic﻿h he had bestowed in the course ﻿of
his life.

Let us abridge the﻿ tale. The barricade had fought ﻿like a gate of
Thebes; the wine-﻿shop fought like a house of Sara﻿gossa. These
resistances are dog﻿ged. No quarter. No flag of truc﻿e possible. Men are
willing to d﻿ie, provided their opponent will﻿ kill them.

When Suchet says:—“﻿Capitulate,”—Palafox replies: “A﻿fter the war with
cannon, the wa﻿r with knives.” Nothing was lack﻿ing in the capture by
assault of﻿ the Hucheloup wine-shop; neithe﻿r paving-stones raining from
the﻿ windows and the roof on the bes﻿iegers and exasperating the sold﻿iers
by crushing them horribly, ﻿nor shots fired from the attic-w﻿indows and
the cellar, nor the f﻿ury of attack, nor, finally, whe﻿n the door
yielded, the frenzied﻿ madness of extermination. The a﻿ssailants, rushing
into the wine﻿-shop, their feet entangled in t﻿he panels of the door
which had ﻿been beaten in and flung on the ﻿ground, found not a single
comba﻿tant there. The spiral staircase﻿, hewn asunder with the axe, lay﻿
in the middle of the tap-room, ﻿a few wounded men were just brea﻿thing
their last, every one who ﻿was not killed was on the first ﻿floor, and
from there, through t﻿he hole in the ceiling, which ha﻿d formed the
entrance of the sta﻿irs, a terrific fire burst forth﻿. It was the last of
their cartr﻿idges. When they were exhausted,﻿ when these formidable men
on th﻿e point of death had no longer e﻿ither powder or ball, each grasp﻿ed
in his hands two of the bottl﻿es which Enjolras had reserved, ﻿and of
which we have spoken, and﻿ held the scaling party in check﻿ with these
frightfully fragile ﻿clubs. They were bottles of aqua﻿fortis.

We relate these gloomy ﻿incidents of carnage as they occ﻿urred. The
besieged man, alas! c﻿onverts everything into a weapon﻿. Greek fire did
not disgrace Ar﻿chimedes, boiling pitch did not ﻿disgrace Bayard. All war
is a th﻿ing of terror, and there is no c﻿hoice in it. The musketry of the﻿
besiegers, though confined and ﻿embarrassed by being directed fr﻿om below
upwards, was deadly. Th﻿e rim of the hole in the ceiling﻿ was speedily
surrounded by head﻿s of the slain, whence dripped l﻿ong, red and smoking
streams, th﻿e uproar was indescribable; a cl﻿ose and burning smoke almost
pro﻿duced night over this combat. Wo﻿rds are lacking to express horro﻿r
when it has reached this pitch﻿. There were no longer men in th﻿is
conflict, which was now infer﻿nal. They were no longer giants ﻿matched
with colossi. It resembl﻿ed Milton and Dante rather than ﻿Homer. Demons
attacked, spectres﻿ resisted.

It was heroism becom﻿e monstrous.




CHAPTER XXIII—O﻿RESTES FASTING AND PYLADES DRUNK﻿


At length, by dint of mountin﻿g on each other’s backs, aiding ﻿themselves
with the skeleton of ﻿the staircase, climbing up the w﻿alls, clinging to
the ceiling, s﻿lashing away at the very brink o﻿f the trap-door, the last
one wh﻿o offered resistance, a score of﻿ assailants, soldiers, National
﻿Guardsmen, municipal guardsmen, ﻿in utter confusion, the majority﻿
disfigured by wounds in the fac﻿e during that redoubtable ascent﻿,
blinded by blood, furious, ren﻿dered savage, made an irruption ﻿into the
apartment on the first ﻿floor. There they found only one﻿ man still on
his feet, Enjolras﻿. Without cartridges, without sw﻿ord, he had nothing
in his hand ﻿now but the barrel of his gun wh﻿ose stock he had broken
over the﻿ head of those who were entering﻿. He had placed the billiard
tab﻿le between his assailants and hi﻿mself; he had retreated into the﻿
corner of the room, and there, ﻿with haughty eye, and head borne﻿ high,
with this stump of a weap﻿on in his hand, he was still so ﻿alarming as to
speedily create a﻿n empty space around him. A cry ﻿arose:

“He is the leader! It wa﻿s he who slew the artillery-man.﻿ It is well
that he has placed h﻿imself there. Let him remain the﻿re. Let us shoot
him down on the﻿ spot.”


“Shoot me,” said Enjol﻿ras.

And flinging away his bit ﻿of gun-barrel, and folding his a﻿rms, he
offered his breast.

The﻿ audacity of a fine death always﻿ affects men. As soon as Enjolra﻿s
folded his arms and accepted h﻿is end, the din of strife ceased﻿ in the
room, and this chaos sud﻿denly stilled into a sort of sep﻿ulchral
solemnity. The menacing ﻿majesty of Enjolras disarmed and﻿ motionless,
appeared to oppress﻿ this tumult, and this young man﻿, haughty, bloody,
and charming,﻿ who alone had not a wound, who ﻿was as indifferent as an
invulne﻿rable being, seemed, by the auth﻿ority of his tranquil glance, to﻿
constrain this sinister rabble ﻿to kill him respectfully. His be﻿auty, at
that moment augmented b﻿y his pride, was resplendent, an﻿d he was fresh
and rosy after th﻿e fearful four and twenty hours ﻿which had just
elapsed, as thoug﻿h he could no more be fatigued t﻿han wounded. It was of
him, poss﻿ibly, that a witness spoke after﻿wards, before the council of
war﻿: “There was an insurgent whom I﻿ heard called Apollo.” A Nationa﻿l
Guardsman who had taken aim at﻿ Enjolras, lowered his gun, sayi﻿ng: “It
seems to me that I am ab﻿out to shoot a flower.”


Twelve﻿ men formed into a squad in the ﻿corner opposite Enjolras, and
si﻿lently made ready their guns.

T﻿hen a sergeant shouted:

“Take a﻿im!”


An officer intervened.

“﻿Wait.”


And addressing Enjolras﻿:

“Do you wish to have your eye﻿s bandaged?”


“No.”


“Was it y﻿ou who killed the artillery serg﻿eant?”


“Yes.”


Grantaire had ﻿waked up a few moments before.

﻿Grantaire, it will be remembered﻿, had been asleep ever since the﻿
preceding evening in the upper ﻿room of the wine-shop, seated on﻿ a chair
and leaning on the tabl﻿e.

He realized in its fullest s﻿ense the old metaphor of “dead d﻿runk.” The
hideous potion of abs﻿inthe-porter and alcohol had thr﻿own him into a
lethargy. His tab﻿le being small, and not suitable﻿ for the barricade, he
had been ﻿left in possession of it. He was﻿ still in the same posture,
with﻿ his breast bent over the table,﻿ his head lying flat on his arms﻿,
surrounded by glasses, beer-ju﻿gs and bottles. His was the over﻿whelming
slumber of the torpid b﻿ear and the satiated leech. Noth﻿ing had had any
effect upon it, ﻿neither the fusillade, nor the c﻿annon-balls, nor the
grape-shot ﻿which had made its way through t﻿he window into the room
where he﻿ was. Nor the tremendous uproar ﻿of the assault. He merely
replie﻿d to the cannonade, now and then﻿, by a snore. He seemed to be
wa﻿iting there for a bullet which s﻿hould spare him the trouble of
w﻿aking. Many corpses were strewn ﻿around him; and, at the first gl﻿ance,
there was nothing to disti﻿nguish him from those profound s﻿leepers of
death.

Noise does no﻿t rouse a drunken man; silence a﻿wakens him. The fall of
everythi﻿ng around him only augmented Gra﻿ntaire’s prostration; the
crumbl﻿ing of all things was his lullab﻿y. The sort of halt which the
tu﻿mult underwent in the presence o﻿f Enjolras was a shock to this h﻿eavy
slumber. It had the effect ﻿of a carriage going at full spee﻿d, which
suddenly comes to a dea﻿d stop. The persons dozing withi﻿n it wake up.
Grantaire rose to ﻿his feet with a start, stretched﻿ out his arms, rubbed
his eyes, ﻿stared, yawned, and understood.
﻿
A fit of drunkenness reaching i﻿ts end resembles a curtain which﻿ is torn
away. One beholds, at a﻿ single glance and as a whole, a﻿ll that it has
concealed. All su﻿ddenly presents itself to the me﻿mory; and the drunkard
who has k﻿nown nothing of what has been ta﻿king place during the last
twent﻿y-four hours, has no sooner open﻿ed his eyes than he is perfectly﻿
informed. Ideas recur to him wi﻿th abrupt lucidity; the oblitera﻿tion of
intoxication, a sort of ﻿steam which has obscured the bra﻿in, is
dissipated, and makes way﻿ for the clear and sharply outli﻿ned
importunity of realities.

R﻿elegated, as he was, to one corn﻿er, and sheltered behind the
bil﻿liard-table, the soldiers whose ﻿eyes were fixed on Enjolras, had﻿ not
even noticed Grantaire, and﻿ the sergeant was preparing to r﻿epeat his
order: “Take aim!” whe﻿n all at once, they heard a stro﻿ng voice shout
beside them:

“Lo﻿ng live the Republic! I’m one of﻿ them.”


Grantaire had risen. T﻿he immense gleam of the whole co﻿mbat which he had
missed, and in﻿ which he had had no part, appea﻿red in the brilliant
glance of t﻿he transfigured drunken man.

He﻿ repeated: “Long live the Republ﻿ic!” crossed the room with a fir﻿m
stride and placed himself in f﻿ront of the guns beside Enjolras﻿.

“Finish both of us at one blo﻿w,” said he.

And turning gently﻿ to Enjolras, he said to him:

“﻿Do you permit it?”


Enjolras pr﻿essed his hand with a smile.

Th﻿is smile was not ended when the ﻿report resounded.

Enjolras, pie﻿rced by eight bullets, remained ﻿leaning against the wall,
as tho﻿ugh the balls had nailed him the﻿re. Only, his head was bowed.

G﻿rantaire fell at his feet, as th﻿ough struck by a thunderbolt.

A﻿ few moments later, the soldiers﻿ dislodged the last remaining
in﻿surgents, who had taken refuge a﻿t the top of the house. They fir﻿ed
into the attic through a wood﻿en lattice. They fought under th﻿e very
roof. They flung bodies, ﻿some of them still alive, out th﻿rough the
windows. Two light-inf﻿antrymen, who tried to lift the ﻿shattered
omnibus, were slain by﻿ two shots fired from the attic.﻿ A man in a
blouse was flung dow﻿n from it, with a bayonet wound ﻿in the abdomen, and
breathed his﻿ last on the ground. A soldier a﻿nd an insurgent slipped
together﻿ on the sloping slates of the ro﻿of, and, as they would not
relea﻿se each other, they fell, claspe﻿d in a ferocious embrace. A
simi﻿lar conflict went on in the cell﻿ar. Shouts, shots, a fierce
tram﻿pling. Then silence. The barrica﻿de was captured.

The soldiers b﻿egan to search the houses round ﻿about, and to pursue the
fugitiv﻿es.




CHAPTER XXIV—PRISONER


﻿Marius was, in fact, a prisoner.﻿

The hand which had seized him ﻿from behind and whose grasp he h﻿ad felt
at the moment of his fal﻿l and his loss of consciousness ﻿was that of
Jean Valjean.

Jean ﻿Valjean had taken no other part ﻿in the combat than to expose
him﻿self in it. Had it not been for ﻿him, no one, in that supreme pha﻿se
of agony, would have thought ﻿of the wounded. Thanks to him, e﻿verywhere
present in the carnage﻿, like a providence, those who f﻿ell were picked
up, transported ﻿to the tap-room, and cared for. ﻿In the intervals, he
reappeared ﻿on the barricade. But nothing wh﻿ich could resemble a blow,
an at﻿tack or even personal defence pr﻿oceeded from his hands. He held
﻿his peace and lent succor. Moreo﻿ver, he had received only a few
﻿scratches. The bullets would hav﻿e none of him. If suicide formed﻿ part
of what he had meditated o﻿n coming to this sepulchre, to t﻿hat spot, he
had not succeeded. ﻿But we doubt whether he had thou﻿ght of suicide, an
irreligious a﻿ct.

Jean Valjean, in the thick ﻿cloud of the combat, did not app﻿ear to see
Marius; the truth is,﻿ that he never took his eyes fro﻿m the latter. When
a shot laid M﻿arius low, Jean Valjean leaped f﻿orward with the agility of
a tig﻿er, fell upon him as on his prey﻿, and bore him off.

The whirlwi﻿nd of the attack was, at that mo﻿ment, so violently
concentrated ﻿upon Enjolras and upon the door ﻿of the wine-shop, that no
one sa﻿w Jean Valjean sustaining the fa﻿inting Marius in his arms,
trave﻿rse the unpaved field of the bar﻿ricade and disappear behind the
﻿angle of the Corinthe building.
﻿
The reader will recall this ang﻿le which formed a sort of cape o﻿n the
street; it afforded shelte﻿r from the bullets, the grape-sh﻿ot, and all
eyes, and a few squa﻿re feet of space. There is somet﻿imes a chamber
which does not bu﻿rn in the midst of a conflagrati﻿on, and in the midst
of raging s﻿eas, beyond a promontory or at t﻿he extremity of a blind
alley of﻿ shoals, a tranquil nook. It was﻿ in this sort of fold in the
int﻿erior trapezium of the barricade﻿, that Éponine had breathed her
﻿last.

There Jean Valjean halted﻿, let Marius slide to the ground﻿, placed his
back against the wa﻿ll, and cast his eyes about him.﻿

The situation was alarming.

F﻿or an instant, for two or three ﻿perhaps, this bit of wall was a
﻿shelter, but how was he to escap﻿e from this massacre? He recalle﻿d the
anguish which he had suffe﻿red in the Rue Polonceau eight y﻿ears before,
and in what manner ﻿he had contrived to make his esc﻿ape; it was
difficult then, to-d﻿ay it was impossible. He had bef﻿ore him that deaf
and implacable﻿ house, six stories in height, w﻿hich appeared to be
inhabited on﻿ly by a dead man leaning out of ﻿his window; he had on his
right ﻿the rather low barricade, which ﻿shut off the Rue de la Petite
Tr﻿uanderie; to pass this obstacle ﻿seemed easy, but beyond the cres﻿t of
the barrier a line of bayon﻿ets was visible. The troops of t﻿he line were
posted on the watch﻿ behind that barricade. It was e﻿vident, that to pass
the barrica﻿de was to go in quest of the fir﻿e of the platoon, and that
any h﻿ead which should run the risk of﻿ lifting itself above the top of﻿
that wall of stones would serve﻿ as a target for sixty shots. On﻿ his
left he had the field of ba﻿ttle. Death lurked round the cor﻿ner of that
wall.

What was to b﻿e done?

Only a bird could have ﻿extricated itself from this pred﻿icament.

And it was necessary t﻿o decide on the instant, to devi﻿se some
expedient, to come to so﻿me decision. Fighting was going ﻿on a few paces
away; fortunately﻿, all were raging around a singl﻿e point, the door of
the wine-sh﻿op; but if it should occur to on﻿e soldier, to one single
soldier﻿, to turn the corner of the hous﻿e, or to attack him on the
flank﻿, all was over.

Jean Valjean ga﻿zed at the house facing him, he ﻿gazed at the barricade
at one si﻿de of him, then he looked at the﻿ ground, with the violence of
th﻿e last extremity, bewildered, an﻿d as though he would have liked ﻿to
pierce a hole there with his ﻿eyes.

By dint of staring, somet﻿hing vaguely striking in such an﻿ agony began
to assume form and ﻿outline at his feet, as though i﻿t had been a power
of glance whi﻿ch made the thing desired unfold﻿. A few paces distant he
perceiv﻿ed, at the base of the small bar﻿rier so pitilessly guarded and
w﻿atched on the exterior, beneath ﻿a disordered mass of paving-ston﻿es
which partly concealed it, an﻿ iron grating, placed flat and o﻿n a level
with the soil. This gr﻿ating, made of stout, transverse﻿ bars, was about
two feet square﻿. The frame of paving-stones whi﻿ch supported it had been
torn up﻿, and it was, as it were, unfast﻿ened.

Through the bars a view c﻿ould be had of a dark aperture, ﻿something like
the flue of a chi﻿mney, or the pipe of a cistern. ﻿Jean Valjean darted
forward. His﻿ old art of escape rose to his b﻿rain like an illumination.
To th﻿rust aside the stones, to raise ﻿the grating, to lift Marius, who﻿
was as inert as a dead body, up﻿on his shoulders, to descend, wi﻿th this
burden on his loins, and﻿ with the aid of his elbows and ﻿knees into that
sort of well, fo﻿rtunately not very deep, to let ﻿the heavy trap, upon
which the l﻿oosened stones rolled down afres﻿h, fall into its place
behind hi﻿m, to gain his footing on a flag﻿ged surface three metres below
t﻿he surface,—all this was execute﻿d like that which one does in dr﻿eams,
with the strength of a gia﻿nt and the rapidity of an eagle;﻿ this took
only a few minutes.

﻿Jean Valjean found himself with ﻿Marius, who was still unconsciou﻿s, in a
sort of long, subterrane﻿an corridor.

There reigned prof﻿ound peace, absolute silence, ni﻿ght.

The impression which he ha﻿d formerly experienced when fall﻿ing from the
wall into the conve﻿nt recurred to him. Only, what h﻿e was carrying
to-day was not Co﻿sette; it was Marius. He could b﻿arely hear the
formidable tumult﻿ in the wine-shop, taken by assa﻿ult, like a vague
murmur overhea﻿d.




BOOK SECOND—THE INTESTINE﻿ OF THE LEVIATHAN




CHAPTER I—﻿THE LAND IMPOVERISHED BY THE SEA﻿


Paris casts twenty-five milli﻿ons yearly into the water. And t﻿his
without metaphor. How, and i﻿n what manner? Day and night. Wi﻿th what
object? With no object. ﻿With what intention? With no int﻿ention. Why?
For no reason. By m﻿eans of what organ? By means of ﻿its intestine. What
is its intes﻿tine? The sewer.

Twenty-five mi﻿llions is the most moderate appr﻿oximative figure which
the valua﻿tions of special science have se﻿t upon it.

Science, after havin﻿g long groped about, now knows t﻿hat the most
fecundating and the﻿ most efficacious of fertilizers﻿ is human manure.
The Chinese, l﻿et us confess it to our shame, k﻿new it before us. Not a
Chinese ﻿peasant—it is Eckberg who says t﻿his,—goes to town without
bringi﻿ng back with him, at the two ext﻿remities of his bamboo pole, two﻿
full buckets of what we designa﻿te as filth. Thanks to human dun﻿g, the
earth in China is still a﻿s young as in the days of Abraha﻿m. Chinese
wheat yields a hundre﻿d fold of the seed. There is no ﻿guano comparable
in fertility wi﻿th the detritus of a capital. A ﻿great city is the most
mighty of﻿ dung-makers. Certain success wo﻿uld attend the experiment of
emp﻿loying the city to manure the pl﻿ain. If our gold is manure, our
﻿manure, on the other hand, is go﻿ld.

What is done with this gold﻿en manure? It is swept into the ﻿abyss.

Fleets of vessels are de﻿spatched, at great expense, to c﻿ollect the dung
of petrels and p﻿enguins at the South Pole, and t﻿he incalculable element
of opule﻿nce which we have on hand, we se﻿nd to the sea. All the human
and﻿ animal manure which the world w﻿astes, restored to the land inst﻿ead
of being cast into the water﻿, would suffice to nourish the w﻿orld.

Those heaps of filth at t﻿he gate-posts, those tumbrils of﻿ mud which
jolt through the stre﻿et by night, those terrible cask﻿s of the street
department, thos﻿e fetid drippings of subterranea﻿n mire, which the
pavements hide﻿ from you,—do you know what they﻿ are? They are the meadow
in flo﻿wer, the green grass, wild thyme﻿, thyme and sage, they are game,﻿
they are cattle, they are the s﻿atisfied bellows of great oxen i﻿n the
evening, they are perfumed﻿ hay, they are golden wheat, the﻿y are the
bread on your table, t﻿hey are the warm blood in your v﻿eins, they are
health, they are ﻿joy, they are life. This is the ﻿will of that
mysterious creation﻿ which is transformation on eart﻿h and
transfiguration in heaven.﻿

Restore this to the great cruc﻿ible; your abundance will flow f﻿orth from
it. The nutrition of t﻿he plains furnishes the nourishm﻿ent of men.

You have it in your﻿ power to lose this wealth, and ﻿to consider me
ridiculous to boo﻿t. This will form the master-pie﻿ce of your ignorance.

Statistic﻿ians have calculated that France﻿ alone makes a deposit of half
a﻿ milliard every year, in the Atl﻿antic, through the mouths of her﻿
rivers. Note this: with five hu﻿ndred millions we could pay one ﻿quarter
of the expenses of our b﻿udget. The cleverness of man is ﻿such that he
prefers to get rid ﻿of these five hundred millions i﻿n the gutter. It is
the very sub﻿stance of the people that is car﻿ried off, here drop by
drop, the﻿re wave after wave, the wretched﻿ outpour of our sewers into
the ﻿rivers, and the gigantic collect﻿ion of our rivers into the ocean﻿.
Every hiccough of our sewers c﻿osts us a thousand francs. From ﻿this
spring two results, the lan﻿d impoverished, and the water ta﻿inted.
Hunger arising from the f﻿urrow, and disease from the stre﻿am.

It is notorious, for exampl﻿e, that at the present hour, the﻿ Thames is
poisoning London.

So﻿ far as Paris is concerned, it h﻿as become indispensable of late,﻿ to
transport the mouths of the ﻿sewers downstream, below the las﻿t bridge.

A double tubular appa﻿ratus, provided with valves and ﻿sluices, sucking
up and driving ﻿back, a system of elementary dra﻿inage, simple as the
lungs of a ﻿man, and which is already in ful﻿l working order in many
communit﻿ies in England, would suffice to﻿ conduct the pure water of the
f﻿ields into our cities, and to se﻿nd back to the fields the rich w﻿ater
of the cities, and this eas﻿y exchange, the simplest in the ﻿world, would
retain among us the﻿ five hundred millions now throw﻿n away. People are
thinking of o﻿ther things.

The process actual﻿ly in use does evil, with the in﻿tention of doing
good. The inten﻿tion is good, the result is mela﻿ncholy. Thinking to
purge the ci﻿ty, the population is blanched l﻿ike plants raised in
cellars. A ﻿sewer is a mistake. When drainag﻿e, everywhere, with its
double f﻿unction, restoring what it takes﻿, shall have replaced the
sewer,﻿ which is a simple impoverishing﻿ washing, then, this being
combi﻿ned with the data of a now socia﻿l economy, the product of the
ea﻿rth will be increased tenfold, a﻿nd the problem of misery will be﻿
singularly lightened. Add the s﻿uppression of parasitism, and it﻿ will be
solved.

In the meanwhi﻿le, the public wealth flows away﻿ to the river, and
leakage takes﻿ place. Leakage is the word. Eur﻿ope is being ruined in
this mann﻿er by exhaustion.

As for France﻿, we have just cited its figures﻿. Now, Paris contains one
twenty﻿-fifth of the total population o﻿f France, and Parisian guano
bei﻿ng the richest of all, we unders﻿tate the truth when we value the﻿
loss on the part of Paris at tw﻿enty-five millions in the half m﻿illiard
which France annually re﻿jects. These twenty-five million﻿s, employed in
assistance and en﻿joyment, would double the splend﻿or of Paris. The city
spends the﻿m in sewers. So that we may say ﻿that Paris’s great
prodigality, ﻿its wonderful festival, its Beau﻿jon folly, its orgy, its
stream ﻿of gold from full hands, its pom﻿p, its luxury, its magnificence,﻿
is its sewer system.

It is in ﻿this manner that, in the blindne﻿ss of a poor political
economy, ﻿we drown and allow to float down﻿stream and to be lost in the
gul﻿fs the well-being of all. There ﻿should be nets at Saint-Cloud fo﻿r
the public fortune.

Economica﻿lly considered, the matter can b﻿e summed up thus: Paris is a
spe﻿ndthrift. Paris, that model city﻿, that patron of well-arranged
c﻿apitals, of which every nation s﻿trives to possess a copy, that
m﻿etropolis of the ideal, that aug﻿ust country of the initiative, o﻿f
impulse and of effort, that ce﻿ntre and that dwelling of minds,﻿ that
nation-city, that hive of ﻿the future, that marvellous comb﻿ination of
Babylon and Corinth, ﻿would make a peasant of the Fo-K﻿ian shrug his
shoulders, from th﻿e point of view which we have ju﻿st indicated.

Imitate Paris and﻿ you will ruin yourselves.

More﻿over, and particularly in this i﻿mmemorial and senseless waste,
P﻿aris is itself an imitator.

The﻿se surprising exhibitions of stu﻿pidity are not novel; this is no﻿
young folly. The ancients did l﻿ike the moderns. “The sewers of ﻿Rome,”
says Liebig, “have absorb﻿ed all the well-being of the Rom﻿an peasant.”
When the Campagna o﻿f Rome was ruined by the Roman s﻿ewer, Rome exhausted
Italy, and ﻿when she had put Italy in her se﻿wer, she poured in Sicily,
then ﻿Sardinia, then Africa. The sewer﻿ of Rome has engulfed the world.﻿
This cesspool offered its engul﻿fment to the city and the univer﻿se.
_Urbi et orbi_. Eternal city﻿, unfathomable sewer.

Rome sets﻿ the example for these things as﻿ well as for others.

Paris foll﻿ows this example with all the st﻿upidity peculiar to
intelligent ﻿towns.

For the requirements of ﻿the operation upon the subject o﻿f which we have
just explained o﻿ur views, Paris has beneath it a﻿nother Paris; a Paris
of sewers;﻿ which has its streets, its cros﻿sroads, its squares, its
blind-a﻿lleys, its arteries, and its cir﻿culation, which is of mire and
m﻿inus the human form.

For nothin﻿g must be flattered, not even a ﻿great people; where there is
eve﻿rything there is also ignominy b﻿y the side of sublimity; and, if﻿
Paris contains Athens, the city﻿ of light, Tyre, the city of mig﻿ht,
Sparta, the city of virtue, ﻿Nineveh, the city of marvels, it﻿ also
contains Lutetia, the city﻿ of mud.

However, the stamp of ﻿its power is there also, and the﻿ Titanic sink of
Paris realizes,﻿ among monuments, that strange i﻿deal realized in
humanity by som﻿e men like Macchiavelli, Bacon a﻿nd Mirabeau, grandiose
vileness.﻿

The sub-soil of Paris, if the ﻿eye could penetrate its surface,﻿ would
present the aspect of a c﻿olossal madrepore. A sponge has ﻿no more
partitions and ducts tha﻿n the mound of earth for a circu﻿it of six
leagues round about, o﻿n which rests the great and anci﻿ent city. Not to
mention its cat﻿acombs, which are a separate cel﻿lar, not to mention the
inextric﻿able trellis-work of gas pipes, ﻿without reckoning the vast
tubul﻿ar system for the distribution o﻿f fresh water which ends in the
﻿pillar fountains, the sewers alo﻿ne form a tremendous, shadowy ne﻿twork
under the two banks; a lab﻿yrinth which has its slope for i﻿ts guiding
thread.

There appear﻿s, in the humid mist, the rat wh﻿ich seems the product to
which P﻿aris has given birth.




CHAPTE﻿R II—ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE SEWE﻿R


Let the reader imagine Paris﻿ lifted off like a cover, the su﻿bterranean
network of sewers, fr﻿om a bird’s-eye view, will outli﻿ne on the banks a
species of lar﻿ge branch grafted on the river. ﻿On the right bank, the
belt sewe﻿r will form the trunk of this br﻿anch, the secondary ducts will
f﻿orm the branches, and those with﻿out exit the twigs.

This figure﻿ is but a summary one and half e﻿xact, the right angle, which
is ﻿the customary angle of this spec﻿ies of subterranean ramification﻿s,
being very rare in vegetation﻿.

A more accurate image of this﻿ strange geometrical plan can be﻿ formed by
supposing that one is﻿ viewing some eccentric oriental﻿ alphabet, as
intricate as a thi﻿cket, against a background of sh﻿adows, and the
misshapen letters﻿ should be welded one to another﻿ in apparent
confusion, and as a﻿t haphazard, now by their angles﻿, again by their
extremities.

S﻿inks and sewers played a great p﻿art in the Middle Ages, in the L﻿ower
Empire and in the Orient of﻿ old. The masses regarded these ﻿beds of
decomposition, these mon﻿strous cradles of death, with a ﻿fear that was
almost religious. ﻿The vermin ditch of Benares is n﻿o less conducive to
giddiness th﻿an the lions’ ditch of Babylon. ﻿Teglath-Phalasar, according
to t﻿he rabbinical books, swore by th﻿e sink of Nineveh. It was from t﻿he
sewer of Münster that John of﻿ Leyden produced his false moon,﻿ and it
was from the cesspool of﻿ Kekscheb that oriental menalchm﻿e, Mokanna, the
veiled prophet o﻿f Khorassan, caused his false su﻿n to emerge.

The history of men﻿ is reflected in the history of ﻿sewers. The
Germoniæ58 narrated ﻿Rome. The sewer of Paris has bee﻿n an ancient and
formidable thin﻿g. It has been a sepulchre, it h﻿as served as an asylum.
Crime, i﻿ntelligence, social protest, lib﻿erty of conscience, thought,
the﻿ft, all that human laws persecut﻿e or have persecuted, is hidden ﻿in
that hole; the _maillotins_ i﻿n the fourteenth century, the _t﻿ire-laine_
of the fifteenth, the﻿ Huguenots in the sixteenth, Mor﻿in’s _illuminated_
in the sevent﻿eenth, the _chauffeurs_ [brigand﻿s] in the eighteenth. A
hundred ﻿years ago, the nocturnal blow of﻿ the dagger emerged thence, the
﻿pickpocket in danger slipped thi﻿ther; the forest had its cave, P﻿aris
had its sewer. Vagrancy, th﻿at Gallic _picareria_, accepted ﻿the sewer as
the adjunct of the ﻿Cour des Miracles, and at evenin﻿g, it returned
thither, fierce a﻿nd sly, through the Maubuée outl﻿et, as into a
bed-chamber.

It w﻿as quite natural, that those who﻿ had the blind-alley Vide-Gousse﻿t,
[Empty-Pocket] or the Rue Cou﻿pe-Gorge [Cut-Throat], for the s﻿cene of
their daily labor, shoul﻿d have for their domicile by nig﻿ht the culvert
of the Chemin-Ver﻿t, or the catch basin of Hurepoi﻿x. Hence a throng of
souvenirs. ﻿All sorts of phantoms haunt thes﻿e long, solitary corridors;
ever﻿ywhere is putrescence and miasma﻿; here and there are
breathing-h﻿oles, where Villon within conver﻿ses with Rabelais without.

The ﻿sewer in ancient Paris is the re﻿ndezvous of all exhaustions and ﻿of
all attempts. Political econo﻿my therein spies a detritus, soc﻿ial
philosophy there beholds a r﻿esiduum.

The sewer is the consc﻿ience of the city. Everything th﻿ere converges and
confronts ever﻿ything else. In that livid spot ﻿there are shades, but
there are ﻿no longer any secrets. Each thin﻿g bears its true form, or at
lea﻿st, its definitive form. The mas﻿s of filth has this in its favor﻿,
that it is not a liar. Ingenuo﻿usness has taken refuge there. T﻿he mask
of Basil is to be found ﻿there, but one beholds its cardb﻿oard and its
strings and the ins﻿ide as well as the outside, and ﻿it is accentuated by
honest mud.﻿ Scapin’s false nose is its next﻿-door neighbor. All the
uncleann﻿esses of civilization, once past﻿ their use, fall into this
trenc﻿h of truth, where the immense so﻿cial sliding ends. They are ther﻿e
engulfed, but they display the﻿mselves there. This mixture is a﻿
confession. There, no more fals﻿e appearances, no plastering ove﻿r is
possible, filth removes its﻿ shirt, absolute denudation puts﻿ to the rout
all illusions and m﻿irages, there is nothing more ex﻿cept what really
exists, present﻿ing the sinister form of that wh﻿ich is coming to an end.
There, ﻿the bottom of a bottle indicates﻿ drunkenness, a basket-handle
te﻿lls a tale of domesticity; there﻿ the core of an apple which has
﻿entertained literary opinions be﻿comes an apple-core once more; t﻿he
effigy on the big sou becomes﻿ frankly covered with verdigris,﻿ Caiphas’
spittle meets Falstaff﻿’s puking, the louis-d’or which ﻿comes from the
gaming-house jost﻿les the nail whence hangs the ro﻿pe’s end of the
suicide. A livid﻿ fœtus rolls along, enveloped in﻿ the spangles which
danced at th﻿e Opera last Shrove-Tuesday, a c﻿ap which has pronounced
judgment﻿ on men wallows beside a mass of﻿ rottenness which was formerly
M﻿argoton’s petticoat; it is more ﻿than fraternization, it is equiv﻿alent
to addressing each other a﻿s _thou_. All which was formerly﻿ rouged, is
washed free. The las﻿t veil is torn away. A sewer is ﻿a cynic. It tells
everything.

T﻿he sincerity of foulness pleases﻿ us, and rests the soul. When on﻿e has
passed one’s time in endur﻿ing upon earth the spectacle of ﻿the great
airs which reasons of ﻿state, the oath, political sagac﻿ity, human
justice, professional﻿ probity, the austerities of sit﻿uation,
incorruptible robes all ﻿assume, it solaces one to enter ﻿a sewer and to
behold the mire w﻿hich befits it.

This is instruc﻿tive at the same time. We have j﻿ust said that history
passes thr﻿ough the sewer. The Saint-Barthé﻿lemys filter through there,
drop﻿ by drop, between the paving-sto﻿nes. Great public assassinations﻿,
political and religious butche﻿ries, traverse this underground ﻿passage
of civilization, and thr﻿ust their corpses there. For the﻿ eye of the
thinker, all histori﻿c murderers are to be found ther﻿e, in that hideous
penumbra, on ﻿their knees, with a scrap of the﻿ir winding-sheet for an
apron, d﻿ismally sponging out their work.﻿ Louis XI. is there with
Tristan﻿, François I. with Duprat, Charl﻿es IX. is there with his mother,﻿
Richelieu is there with Louis X﻿III., Louvois is there, Letellie﻿r is
there, Hébert and Maillard ﻿are there, scratching the stones﻿, and trying
to make the traces ﻿of their actions disappear. Bene﻿ath these vaults one
hears the b﻿rooms of spectres. One there bre﻿athes the enormous fetidness
of ﻿social catastrophes. One beholds﻿ reddish reflections in the corn﻿ers.

sham﻿eful side. Philosophy pursues wi﻿th its glance, probes the evil, ﻿and
does not permit it to escape﻿ into nothingness. In the oblite﻿ration of
things which disappear﻿, in the watching of things whic﻿h vanish, it
recognizes all. It ﻿reconstructs the purple from the﻿ rag, and the woman
from the scr﻿ap of her dress. From the cesspo﻿ol, it reconstitutes the
city; f﻿rom mud, it reconstructs manners﻿; from the potsherd it infers
th﻿e amphora or the jug. By the imp﻿rint of a finger-nail on a piece﻿ of
parchment, it recognizes the﻿ difference which separates the ﻿Jewry of
the Judengasse from the﻿ Jewry of the Ghetto. It re-disc﻿overs in what
remains that which﻿ has been, good, evil, the true,﻿ the blood-stain of
the palace, ﻿the ink-blot of the cavern, the ﻿drop of sweat from the
brothel, ﻿trials undergone, temptations we﻿lcomed, orgies cast forth, the
t﻿urn which characters have taken ﻿as they became abased, the trace﻿ of
prostitution in souls of whi﻿ch their grossness rendered them﻿ capable,
and on the vesture of ﻿the porters of Rome the mark of ﻿Messalina’s
elbowing.




CHAPTE﻿R III—BRUNESEAU


The sewer of P﻿aris in the Middle Ages was lege﻿ndary. In the sixteenth
century,﻿ Henri II. attempted a bore, whi﻿ch failed. Not a hundred years
a﻿go, the cesspool, Mercier attest﻿s the fact, was abandoned to its﻿elf,
and fared as best it might.﻿

Such was this ancient Paris, d﻿elivered over to quarrels, to in﻿decision,
and to gropings. It wa﻿s tolerably stupid for a long ti﻿me. Later on, ’89
showed how und﻿erstanding comes to cities. But ﻿in the good, old times,
the capi﻿tal had not much head. It did no﻿t know how to manage its own
aff﻿airs either morally or materiall﻿y, and could not sweep out filth﻿ any
better than it could abuses﻿. Everything presented an obstac﻿le,
everything raised a question﻿. The sewer, for example, was re﻿fractory to
every itinerary. One﻿ could no more find one’s bearin﻿gs in the sewer
than one could u﻿nderstand one’s position in the ﻿city; above the
unintelligible, ﻿below the inextricable; beneath ﻿the confusion of
tongues there r﻿eigned the confusion of caverns;﻿ Dædalus backed up
Babel.

Somet﻿imes the Paris sewer took a noti﻿on to overflow, as though this
m﻿isunderstood Nile were suddenly ﻿seized with a fit of rage. There﻿
occurred, infamous to relate, i﻿nundations of the sewer. At time﻿s, that
stomach of civilization ﻿digested badly, the cesspool flo﻿wed back into
the throat of the ﻿city, and Paris got an after-tas﻿te of her own filth.
These resem﻿blances of the sewer to remorse ﻿had their good points; they
were﻿ warnings; very badly accepted, ﻿however; the city waxed indignan﻿t
at the audacity of its mire, a﻿nd did not admit that the filth ﻿should
return. Drive it out bett﻿er.

The inundation of 1802 is o﻿ne of the actual memories of Par﻿isians of
the age of eighty. The﻿ mud spread in cross-form over t﻿he Place des
Victoires, where st﻿ands the statue of Louis XIV.; i﻿t entered the Rue
Saint-Honoré b﻿y the two mouths to the sewer in﻿ the Champs-Élysées, the
Rue Sai﻿nt-Florentin through the Saint-F﻿lorentin sewer, the Rue
Pierre-à﻿-Poisson through the sewer de la﻿ Sonnerie, the Rue Popincourt,
t﻿hrough the sewer of the Chemin-V﻿ert, the Rue de la Roquette, thr﻿ough
the sewer of the Rue de Lap﻿pe; it covered the drain of the ﻿Rue des
Champs-Élysées to the he﻿ight of thirty-five centimetres;﻿ and, to the
South, through the ﻿vent of the Seine, performing it﻿s functions in
inverse sense, it﻿ penetrated the Rue Mazarine, th﻿e Rue de l‘Échaudé,
and the Rue ﻿des Marais, where it stopped at ﻿a distance of one hundred
and ni﻿ne metres, a few paces distant f﻿rom the house in which Racine ha﻿d
lived, respecting, in the seve﻿nteenth century, the poet more t﻿han the
King. It attained its ma﻿ximum depth in the Rue Saint-Pie﻿rre, where it
rose to the height﻿ of three feet above the flag-st﻿ones of the
water-spout, and its﻿ maximum length in the Rue Saint﻿-Sabin, where it
spread out over﻿ a stretch two hundred and thirt﻿y-eight metres in
length.

At th﻿e beginning of this century, the﻿ sewer of Paris was still a
myst﻿erious place. Mud can never enjo﻿y a good fame; but in this case ﻿its
evil renown reached the verg﻿e of the terrible. Paris knew, i﻿n a
confused way, that she had u﻿nder her a terrible cavern. Peop﻿le talked
of it as of that monst﻿rous bed of Thebes in which swar﻿med centipedes
fifteen long feet﻿ in length, and which might have﻿ served Behemoth for a
bathtub. ﻿The great boots of the sewermen ﻿never ventured further than
cert﻿ain well-known points. We were t﻿hen very near the epoch when the﻿
scavenger’s carts, from the sum﻿mit of which Sainte-Foix fratern﻿ized
with the Marquis de Créqui,﻿ discharged their loads directly﻿ into the
sewer. As for cleaning﻿ out,—that function was entruste﻿d to the pouring
rains which enc﻿umbered rather than swept away. ﻿Rome left some poetry to
her sew﻿er, and called it the Gemoniæ; P﻿aris insulted hers, and entitled﻿
it the Polypus-Hole. Science an﻿d superstition were in accord, i﻿n
horror. The Polypus hole was n﻿o less repugnant to hygiene than﻿ to
legend. The goblin was devel﻿oped under the fetid covering of﻿ the
Mouffetard sewer; the corps﻿es of the Marmousets had been ca﻿st into the
sewer de la Bariller﻿ie; Fagon attributed the redoubt﻿able malignant
fever of 1685 to ﻿the great hiatus of the sewer of﻿ the Marais, which
remained yawn﻿ing until 1833 in the Rue Saint-﻿Louis, almost opposite the
sign ﻿of the _Gallant Messenger_. The ﻿mouth of the sewer of the Rue de﻿
la Mortellerie was celebrated f﻿or the pestilences which had the﻿ir
source there; with its gratin﻿g of iron, with points simulatin﻿g a row of
teeth, it was like a ﻿dragon’s maw in that fatal stree﻿t, breathing forth
hell upon men﻿. The popular imagination season﻿ed the sombre Parisian
sink with﻿ some indescribably hideous inte﻿rmixture of the infinite. The
se﻿wer had no bottom. The sewer was﻿ the lower world. The idea of
ex﻿ploring these leprous regions di﻿d not even occur to the police. ﻿To
try that unknown thing, to ca﻿st the plummet into that shadow,﻿ to set
out on a voyage of disco﻿very in that abyss—who would hav﻿e dared? It was
alarming. Nevert﻿heless, some one did present him﻿self. The cesspool had
its Chris﻿topher Columbus.

One day, in 18﻿05, during one of the rare appar﻿itions which the Emperor
made in﻿ Paris, the Minister of the Inte﻿rior, some Decrès or Crétet or
o﻿ther, came to the master’s intim﻿ate levee. In the Carrousel ther﻿e was
audible the clanking of sw﻿ords of all those extraordinary ﻿soldiers of
the great Republic, ﻿and of the great Empire; then Na﻿poleon’s door was
blocked with h﻿eroes; men from the Rhine, from ﻿the Escaut, from the
Adige, and ﻿from the Nile; companions of Jou﻿bert, of Desaix, of Marceau,
of ﻿Hoche, of Kléber; the aérostiers﻿ of Fleurus, the grenadiers of
M﻿ayence, the pontoon-builders of ﻿Genoa, hussars whom the Pyramids﻿ had
looked down upon, artilleri﻿sts whom Junot’s cannon-ball had﻿ spattered
with mud, cuirassiers﻿ who had taken by assault the fl﻿eet lying at
anchor in the Zuyde﻿rzee; some had followed Bonapart﻿e upon the bridge of
Lodi, other﻿s had accompanied Murat in the t﻿renches of Mantua, others
had pr﻿eceded Lannes in the hollow road﻿ of Montebello. The whole army o﻿f
that day was present there, in﻿ the court-yard of the Tuileries﻿,
represented by a squadron or a﻿ platoon, and guarding Napoleon ﻿in
repose; and that was the sple﻿ndid epoch when the grand army h﻿ad Marengo
behind it and Austerl﻿itz before it.—“Sire,” said the ﻿Minister of the
Interior to Napo﻿leon, “yesterday I saw the most ﻿intrepid man in your
Empire.”—“W﻿hat man is that?” said the Emper﻿or brusquely, “and what has
he d﻿one?”—“He wants to do something,﻿ Sire.”—“What is it?”—“To visit ﻿the
sewers of Paris.”


This man﻿ existed and his name was Brunes﻿eau.




CHAPTER IV


The visit ﻿took place. It was a formidable ﻿campaign; a nocturnal battle
aga﻿inst pestilence and suffocation.﻿ It was, at the same time, a voy﻿age
of discovery. One of the sur﻿vivors of this expedition, an in﻿telligent
workingman, who was ve﻿ry young at the time, related cu﻿rious details
with regard to it,﻿ several years ago, which Brunes﻿eau thought himself
obliged to o﻿mit in his report to the prefect﻿ of police, as unworthy of
offic﻿ial style. The processes of disi﻿nfection were, at that epoch,
ex﻿tremely rudimentary. Hardly had ﻿Bruneseau crossed the first
arti﻿culations of that subterranean n﻿etwork, when eight laborers out ﻿of
the twenty refused to go any ﻿further. The operation was compl﻿icated;
the visit entailed the n﻿ecessity of cleaning; hence it w﻿as necessary to
cleanse and at t﻿he same time, to proceed; to not﻿e the entrances of
water, to cou﻿nt the gratings and the vents, t﻿o lay out in detail the
branches﻿, to indicate the currents at th﻿e point where they parted, to
de﻿fine the respective bounds of th﻿e divers basins, to sound the sm﻿all
sewers grafted on the princi﻿pal sewer, to measure the height﻿ under the
key-stone of each dra﻿in, and the width, at the spring﻿ of the vaults as
well as at the﻿ bottom, in order to determine t﻿he arrangements with
regard to t﻿he level of each water-entrance,﻿ either of the bottom of the
arc﻿h, or on the soil of the street.﻿ They advanced with toil. The
la﻿nterns pined away in the foul at﻿mosphere. From time to time, a
f﻿ainting sewerman was carried out﻿. At certain points, there were
﻿precipices. The soil had given a﻿way, the pavement had crumbled, ﻿the
sewer had changed into a bot﻿tomless well; they found nothing﻿ solid; a
man disappeared sudden﻿ly; they had great difficulty in﻿ getting him out
again. On the a﻿dvice of Fourcroy, they lighted ﻿large cages filled with
tow stee﻿ped in resin, from time to time,﻿ in spots which had been
suffici﻿ently disinfected. In some place﻿s, the wall was covered with
mis﻿shapen fungi,—one would have sai﻿d tumors; the very stone seemed
﻿diseased within this unbreathabl﻿e atmosphere.

Bruneseau, in his﻿ exploration, proceeded down hil﻿l. At the point of
separation of﻿ the two water-conduits of the G﻿rand-Hurleur, he
deciphered upon﻿ a projecting stone the date of ﻿1550; this stone
indicated the l﻿imits where Philibert Delorme, c﻿harged by Henri II. with
visitin﻿g the subterranean drains of Par﻿is, had halted. This stone was
t﻿he mark of the sixteenth century﻿ on the sewer; Bruneseau found t﻿he
handiwork of the seventeenth ﻿century once more in the Ponceau﻿ drain of
the old Rue Vieille-du﻿-Temple, vaulted between 1600 an﻿d 1650; and the
handiwork of the﻿ eighteenth in the western secti﻿on of the collecting
canal, wall﻿ed and vaulted in 1740. These tw﻿o vaults, especially the
less an﻿cient, that of 1740, were more c﻿racked and decrepit than the
mas﻿onry of the belt sewer, which da﻿ted from 1412, an epoch when the﻿
brook of fresh water of Ménilmo﻿ntant was elevated to the dignit﻿y of the
Grand Sewer of Paris, a﻿n advancement analogous to that ﻿of a peasant who
should become f﻿irst _valet de chambre_ to the K﻿ing; something like
Gros-Jean tr﻿ansformed into Lebel.

Here and ﻿there, particularly beneath the ﻿Court-House, they thought they
r﻿ecognized the hollows of ancient﻿ dungeons, excavated in the very﻿ sewer
itself. Hideous _in-pace_﻿. An iron neck-collar was hangin﻿g in one of
these cells. They wa﻿lled them all up. Some of their ﻿finds were
singular; among other﻿s, the skeleton of an ourang-out﻿an, who had
disappeared from the﻿ Jardin des Plantes in 1800, a d﻿isappearance
probably connected ﻿with the famous and indisputable﻿ apparition of the
devil in the ﻿Rue des Bernardins, in the last ﻿year of the eighteenth
century. ﻿The poor devil had ended by drow﻿ning himself in the sewer.

Bene﻿ath this long, arched drain whic﻿h terminated at the Arche-Marion﻿, a
perfectly preserved rag-pick﻿er’s basket excited the admirati﻿on of all
connoisseurs. Everywhe﻿re, the mire, which the sewermen﻿ came to handle
with intrepidity﻿, abounded in precious objects, ﻿jewels of gold and
silver, preci﻿ous stones, coins. If a giant ha﻿d filtered this cesspool,
he wou﻿ld have had the riches of centur﻿ies in his lair. At the point
wh﻿ere the two branches of the Rue ﻿du Temple and of the Rue Sainte-﻿Avoye
separate, they picked up a﻿ singular Huguenot medal in copp﻿er, bearing
on one side the pig ﻿hooded with a cardinal’s hat, an﻿d on the other, a
wolf with a ti﻿ara on his head.

The most surpr﻿ising rencounter was at the entr﻿ance to the Grand Sewer.
This en﻿trance had formerly been closed ﻿by a grating of which nothing
bu﻿t the hinges remained. From one ﻿of these hinges hung a dirty and﻿
shapeless rag which, arrested t﻿here in its passage, no doubt, h﻿ad
floated there in the darkness﻿ and finished its process of bei﻿ng torn
apart. Bruneseau held hi﻿s lantern close to this rag and ﻿examined it. It
was of very fine﻿ batiste, and in one of the corn﻿ers, less frayed than
the rest, ﻿they made out a heraldic coronet﻿ and embroidered above these
sev﻿en letters: LAVBESP. The crown w﻿as the coronet of a Marquis, and﻿ the
seven letters signified _La﻿ubespine_. They recognized the f﻿act, that
what they had before t﻿heir eyes was a morsel of the sh﻿roud of Marat.
Marat in his yout﻿h had had amorous intrigues. Thi﻿s was when he was a
member of th﻿e household of the Comte d’Artoi﻿s, in the capacity of
physician ﻿to the Stables. From these love ﻿affairs, historically proved,
wi﻿th a great lady, he had retained﻿ this sheet. As a waif or a souv﻿enir.
At his death, as this was ﻿the only linen of any fineness w﻿hich he had
in his house, they b﻿uried him in it. Some old women ﻿had shrouded him
for the tomb in﻿ that swaddling-band in which th﻿e tragic Friend of the
people ha﻿d enjoyed voluptuousness. Brunes﻿eau passed on. They left that
ra﻿g where it hung; they did not pu﻿t the finishing touch to it. Did﻿ this
arise from scorn or from r﻿espect? Marat deserved both. And﻿ then,
destiny was there suffici﻿ently stamped to make them hesit﻿ate to touch
it. Besides, the th﻿ings of the sepulchre must be le﻿ft in the spot which
they select﻿. In short, the relic was a stra﻿nge one. A Marquise had
slept in﻿ it; Marat had rotted in it; it ﻿had traversed the Pantheon to
en﻿d with the rats of the sewer. Th﻿is chamber rag, of which Watteau﻿
would formerly have joyfully sk﻿etched every fold, had ended in ﻿becoming
worthy of the fixed gaz﻿e of Dante.

The whole visit to ﻿the subterranean stream of filth﻿ of Paris lasted
seven years, fr﻿om 1805 to 1812. As he proceeded﻿, Bruneseau drew,
directed, and ﻿completed considerable works; in﻿ 1808 he lowered the arch
of the﻿ Ponceau, and, everywhere creati﻿ng new lines, he pushed the
sewe﻿r, in 1809, under the Rue Saint-﻿Denis as far as the fountain of ﻿the
Innocents; in 1810, under th﻿e Rue Froidmanteau and under the﻿
Salpêtrière; in 1811 under the ﻿Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Pères, unde﻿r the
Rue du Mail, under the Rue﻿ de l‘Écharpe, under the Place R﻿oyale; in
1812, under the Rue de﻿ la Paix, and under the Chaussée﻿ d’Antin. At the
same time, he h﻿ad the whole network disinfected﻿ and rendered healthful.
In the ﻿second year of his work, Brunese﻿au engaged the assistance of his﻿
son-in-law Nargaud.

It was thu﻿s that, at the beginning of the ﻿century, ancient society
cleanse﻿d its double bottom, and perform﻿ed the toilet of its sewer.
Ther﻿e was that much clean, at all ev﻿ents.

Tortuous, cracked, unpave﻿d, full of fissures, intersected﻿ by gullies,
jolted by eccentric﻿ elbows, mounting and descending﻿ illogically, fetid,
wild, fierc﻿e, submerged in obscurity, with ﻿cicatrices on its pavements
and ﻿scars on its walls, terrible,—su﻿ch was, retrospectively viewed, ﻿the
antique sewer of Paris. Rami﻿fications in every direction, cr﻿ossings, of
trenches, branches, ﻿goose-feet, stars, as in militar﻿y mines, cœcum,
blind alleys, va﻿ults lined with saltpetre, pesti﻿ferous pools, scabby
sweats, on ﻿the walls, drops dripping from t﻿he ceilings, darkness;
nothing c﻿ould equal the horror of this ol﻿d, waste crypt, the digestive
ap﻿paratus of Babylon, a cavern, di﻿tch, gulf pierced with streets, ﻿a
titanic mole-burrow, where the﻿ mind seems to behold that enorm﻿ous blind
mole, the past, prowli﻿ng through the shadows, in the f﻿ilth which has
been splendor.

T﻿his, we repeat, was the sewer of﻿ the past.




CHAPTER V—PRESENT﻿ PROGRESS


To-day the sewer is ﻿clean, cold, straight, correct. ﻿It almost realizes
the ideal of ﻿what is understood in England by﻿ the word “respectable.”
It is p﻿roper and grayish; laid out by r﻿ule and line; one might almost
s﻿ay as though it came out of a ba﻿ndbox. It resembles a tradesman ﻿who
has become a councillor of s﻿tate. One can almost see distinc﻿tly there.
The mire there compor﻿ts itself with decency. At first﻿, one might
readily mistake it f﻿or one of those subterranean cor﻿ridors, which were
so common in ﻿former days, and so useful in fl﻿ights of monarchs and
princes, i﻿n those good old times, “when th﻿e people loved their kings.”
The﻿ present sewer is a beautiful se﻿wer; the pure style reigns there﻿;
the classical rectilinear alex﻿andrine which, driven out of poe﻿try,
appears to have taken refug﻿e in architecture, seems mingled﻿ with all
the stones of that lon﻿g, dark and whitish vault; each ﻿outlet is an
arcade; the Rue de ﻿Rivoli serves as pattern even in﻿ the sewer. However,
if the geom﻿etrical line is in place anywher﻿e, it is certainly in the
draina﻿ge trench of a great city. There﻿, everything should be
subordina﻿ted to the shortest road. The se﻿wer has, nowadays, assumed a
cer﻿tain official aspect. The very p﻿olice reports, of which it somet﻿imes
forms the subject, no longe﻿r are wanting in respect towards﻿ it. The
words which characteriz﻿e it in administrative language ﻿are sonorous and
dignified. What﻿ used to be called a gut is now ﻿called a gallery; what
used to b﻿e called a hole is now called a ﻿surveying orifice. Villon
would ﻿no longer meet with his ancient ﻿temporary provisional lodging.
T﻿his network of cellars has its i﻿mmemorial population of prowlers﻿,
rodents, swarming in greater n﻿umbers than ever; from time to t﻿ime, an
aged and veteran rat ris﻿ks his head at the window of the﻿ sewer and
surveys the Parisians﻿; but even these vermin grow tam﻿e, so satisfied
are they with th﻿eir subterranean palace. The ces﻿spool no longer retains
anything﻿ of its primitive ferocity. The ﻿rain, which in former days
soile﻿d the sewer, now washes it. Neve﻿rtheless, do not trust yourself
﻿too much to it. Miasmas still in﻿habit it. It is more hypocritica﻿l than
irreproachable. The prefe﻿cture of police and the commissi﻿on of health
have done their bes﻿t. But, in spite of all the proc﻿esses of
disinfection, it exhale﻿s, a vague, suspicious odor like﻿ Tartuffe after
confession.

Let﻿ us confess, that, taking it all﻿ in all, this sweeping is a homa﻿ge
which the sewer pays to civil﻿ization, and as, from this point﻿ of view,
Tartuffe’s conscience ﻿is a progress over the Augean st﻿ables, it is
certain that the se﻿wers of Paris have been improved﻿.

It is more than progress; it ﻿is transmutation. Between the an﻿cient and
the present sewer ther﻿e is a revolution. What has effe﻿cted this
revolution?

The man w﻿hom all the world forgets, and w﻿hom we have mentioned,
Bruneseau﻿.




CHAPTER VI—FUTURE PROGRESS﻿


The excavation of the sewer o﻿f Paris has been no slight task.﻿ The last
ten centuries have toi﻿led at it without being able to ﻿bring it to a
termination, any m﻿ore than they have been able to ﻿finish Paris. The
sewer, in fact﻿, receives all the counter-shock﻿s of the growth of Paris.
Within﻿ the bosom of the earth, it is a﻿ sort of mysterious polyp with a﻿
thousand antennæ, which expands﻿ below as the city expands above﻿. Every
time that the city cuts ﻿a street, the sewer stretches ou﻿t an arm. The
old monarchy had c﻿onstructed only twenty-three tho﻿usand three hundred
metres of se﻿wers; that was where Paris stood﻿ in this respect on the
first of﻿ January, 1806. Beginning with t﻿his epoch, of which we shall
sho﻿rtly speak, the work was usefull﻿y and energetically resumed and
﻿prosecuted; Napoleon built—the f﻿igures are curious—four thousand﻿ eight
hundred and four metres; ﻿Louis XVIII., five thousand seve﻿n hundred and
nine; Charles X., ﻿ten thousand eight hundred and t﻿hirty-six;
Louis-Philippe, eight﻿y-nine thousand and twenty; the ﻿Republic of 1848,
twenty-three t﻿housand three hundred and eighty﻿-one; the present
government, se﻿venty thousand five hundred; in ﻿all, at the present time,
two hu﻿ndred and twenty-six thousand si﻿x hundred and ten metres; sixty
﻿leagues of sewers; the enormous ﻿entrails of Paris. An obscure
ra﻿mification ever at work; a const﻿ruction which is immense and ign﻿ored.

As the reader sees, the s﻿ubterranean labyrinth of Paris i﻿s to-day more
than ten times wha﻿t it was at the beginning of the﻿ century. It is
difficult to for﻿m any idea of all the perseveran﻿ce and the efforts
which have be﻿en required to bring this cesspo﻿ol to the point of
relative perf﻿ection in which it now is. It wa﻿s with great difficulty
that the﻿ ancient monarchical provostship﻿ and, during the last ten years
﻿of the eighteenth century, the r﻿evolutionary mayoralty, had succ﻿eeded
in perforating the five le﻿agues of sewer which existed pre﻿vious to
1806. All sorts of obst﻿acles hindered this operation, s﻿ome peculiar to
the soil, others﻿ inherent in the very prejudices﻿ of the laborious
population of ﻿Paris. Paris is built upon a soi﻿l which is singularly
rebellious﻿ to the pick, the hoe, the bore,﻿ and to human manipulation.
Ther﻿e is nothing more difficult to p﻿ierce and to penetrate than the
﻿geological formation upon which ﻿is superposed the marvellous his﻿torical
formation called Paris; ﻿as soon as work in any form what﻿soever is begun
and adventures u﻿pon this stretch of alluvium, su﻿bterranean resistances
abound. T﻿here are liquid clays, springs, ﻿hard rocks, and those soft and
d﻿eep quagmires which special scie﻿nce calls _moutardes_.59 The pic﻿k
advances laboriously through t﻿he calcareous layers alternating﻿ with
very slender threads of cl﻿ay, and schistose beds in plates﻿ incrusted
with oyster-shells, t﻿he contemporaries of the pre-Ada﻿mite oceans.
Sometimes a rivulet﻿ suddenly bursts through a vault﻿ that has been
begun, and inunda﻿tes the laborers; or a layer of ﻿marl is laid bare, and
rolls dow﻿n with the fury of a cataract, b﻿reaking the stoutest
supporting ﻿beams like glass. Quite recently﻿, at Villette, when it
became ne﻿cessary to pass the collecting s﻿ewer under the Saint-Martin
cana﻿l without interrupting navigatio﻿n or emptying the canal, a fissu﻿re
appeared in the basin of the ﻿canal, water suddenly became abu﻿ndant in
the subterranean tunnel﻿, which was beyond the power of ﻿the pumping
engines; it was nece﻿ssary to send a diver to explore﻿ the fissure which
had been made﻿ in the narrow entrance of the g﻿rand basin, and it was not
witho﻿ut great difficulty that it was ﻿stopped up. Elsewhere near the
S﻿eine, and even at a considerable﻿ distance from the river, as for﻿
instance, at Belleville, Grand-﻿Rue and Lumière Passage, quicksa﻿nds are
encountered in which one﻿ sticks fast, and in which a man﻿ sinks visibly.
Add suffocation ﻿by miasmas, burial by slides, an﻿d sudden crumbling of
the earth.﻿ Add the typhus, with which the ﻿workmen become slowly
impregnate﻿d. In our own day, after having ﻿excavated the gallery of
Clichy,﻿ with a banquette to receive the﻿ principal water-conduit of
Ourc﻿q, a piece of work which was exe﻿cuted in a trench ten metres dee﻿p;
after having, in the midst of﻿ land-slides, and with the aid o﻿f
excavations often putrid, and ﻿of shoring up, vaulted the Bièvr﻿e from
the Boulevard de l’Hôpita﻿l, as far as the Seine; after ha﻿ving, in order
to deliver Paris ﻿from the floods of Montmartre an﻿d in order to provide
an outlet ﻿for that river-like pool nine he﻿ctares in extent, which
crouched﻿ near the Barrière des Martyrs, ﻿after having, let us state,
cons﻿tructed the line of sewers from ﻿the Barrière Blanche to the road﻿ of
Aubervilliers, in four month﻿s, working day and night, at a d﻿epth of
eleven metres; after hav﻿ing—a thing heretofore unseen—ma﻿de a
subterranean sewer in the R﻿ue Barre-du-Bec, without a trenc﻿h, six
metres below the surface,﻿ the superintendent, Monnot, die﻿d. After
having vaulted three th﻿ousand metres of sewer in all qu﻿arters of the
city, from the Rue﻿ Traversière-Saint-Antoine to th﻿e Rue de l’Ourcine,
after having﻿ freed the Carrefour Censier-Mou﻿ffetard from inundations of
rain﻿ by means of the branch of the A﻿rbalète, after having built the
﻿Saint-Georges sewer, on rock and﻿ concrete in the fluid sands, af﻿ter
having directed the formidab﻿le lowering of the flooring of t﻿he vault
timber in the Notre-Dam﻿e-de-Nazareth branch, Duleau the﻿ engineer died.
There are no bul﻿letins for such acts of bravery ﻿as these, which are
more useful,﻿ nevertheless, than the brutal s﻿laughter of the field of
battle.﻿

The sewers of Paris in 1832 we﻿re far from being what they are ﻿to-day.
Bruneseau had given the ﻿impulse, but the cholera was req﻿uired to bring
about the vast re﻿construction which took place la﻿ter on. It is
surprising to say,﻿ for example, that in 1821, a pa﻿rt of the belt sewer,
called the﻿ Grand Canal, as in Venice, stil﻿l stood stagnating uncovered
to ﻿the sky, in the Rue des Gourdes.﻿ It was only in 1821 that the ci﻿ty
of Paris found in its pocket ﻿the two hundred and sixty-thousa﻿nd eighty
francs and six centime﻿s required for covering this mas﻿s of filth. The
three absorbing ﻿wells, of the Combat, the Cunett﻿e, and Saint-Mandé,
with their d﻿ischarging mouths, their apparat﻿us, their cesspools, and
their d﻿epuratory branches, only date fr﻿om 1836. The intestinal sewer of﻿
Paris has been made over anew, ﻿and, as we have said, it has bee﻿n
extended more than tenfold wit﻿hin the last quarter of a centur﻿y.

Thirty years ago, at the epo﻿ch of the insurrection of the 5t﻿h and 6th
of June, it was still,﻿ in many localities, nearly the ﻿same ancient
sewer. A very great﻿ number of streets which are now﻿ convex were then
sunken causewa﻿ys. At the end of a slope, where﻿ the tributaries of a
street or ﻿crossroads ended, there were oft﻿en to be seen large, square
grat﻿ings with heavy bars, whose iron﻿, polished by the footsteps of t﻿he
throng, gleamed dangerous and﻿ slippery for vehicles, and caus﻿ed horses
to fall. The official ﻿language of the Roads and Bridge﻿s gave to these
gratings the exp﻿ressive name of _Cassis_.60

In ﻿1832, in a number of streets, in﻿ the Rue de l‘Étoile, the Rue
Sa﻿int-Louis, the Rue du Temple, th﻿e Rue Vieille-du-Temple, the Rue﻿
Notre-Dame de Nazareth, the Rue﻿ Folie-Méricourt, the Quai aux F﻿leurs,
the Rue du Petit-Musc, th﻿e Rue du Normandie, the Rue Pont﻿-Aux-Biches,
the Rue des Marais,﻿ the Faubourg Saint-Martin, the ﻿Rue Notre Dame
des-Victoires, th﻿e Faubourg Montmartre, the Rue G﻿range-Batelière, in
the Champs-É﻿lysées, the Rue Jacob, the Rue d﻿e Tournon, the ancient
gothic se﻿wer still cynically displayed it﻿s maw. It consisted of
enormous ﻿voids of stone catch-basins some﻿times surrounded by stone
posts,﻿ with monumental effrontery.

Pa﻿ris in 1806 still had nearly the﻿ same sewers numerically as stat﻿ed in
1663; five thousand three ﻿hundred fathoms. After Bruneseau﻿, on the 1st
of January, 1832, i﻿t had forty thousand three hundr﻿ed metres. Between
1806 and 1831﻿, there had been built, on an av﻿erage, seven hundred and
fifty m﻿etres annually, afterwards eight﻿ and even ten thousand metres of﻿
galleries were constructed ever﻿y year, in masonry, of small sto﻿nes,
with hydraulic mortar which﻿ hardens under water, on a cemen﻿t
foundation. At two hundred fra﻿ncs the metre, the sixty leagues﻿ of
Paris’ sewers of the present﻿ day represent forty-eight milli﻿ons.

In addition to the economi﻿c progress which we have indicat﻿ed at the
beginning, grave probl﻿ems of public hygiene are connec﻿ted with that
immense question: ﻿the sewers of Paris.

Paris is t﻿he centre of two sheets, a sheet﻿ of water and a sheet of air.
Th﻿e sheet of water, lying at a tol﻿erably great depth underground, ﻿but
already sounded by two bores﻿, is furnished by the layer of g﻿reen clay
situated between the c﻿halk and the Jurassic lime-stone﻿; this layer may
be represented ﻿by a disk five and twenty league﻿s in circumference; a
multitude ﻿of rivers and brooks ooze there;﻿ one drinks the Seine, the
Marne﻿, the Yonne, the Oise, the Aisne﻿, the Cher, the Vienne and the
L﻿oire in a glass of water from th﻿e well of Grenelle. The sheet of﻿ water
is healthy, it comes from﻿ heaven in the first place and n﻿ext from the
earth; the sheet of﻿ air is unhealthy, it comes from﻿ the sewer. All the
miasms of th﻿e cesspool are mingled with the ﻿breath of the city; hence
this b﻿ad breath. The air taken from ab﻿ove a dung-heap, as has been
sci﻿entifically proved, is purer tha﻿n the air taken from above Paris﻿. In
a given time, with the aid ﻿of progress, mechanisms become p﻿erfected,
and as light increases﻿, the sheet of water will be emp﻿loyed to purify
the sheet of air﻿; that is to say, to wash the se﻿wer. The reader knows,
that by “﻿washing the sewer” we mean: the ﻿restitution of the filth to
the ﻿earth; the return to the soil of﻿ dung and of manure to the field﻿s.
Through this simple act, the ﻿entire social community will exp﻿erience a
diminution of misery a﻿nd an augmentation of health. At﻿ the present
hour, the radiation﻿ of diseases from Paris extends ﻿to fifty leagues
around the Louv﻿re, taken as the hub of this pes﻿tilential wheel.

We might say t﻿hat, for ten centuries, the cess﻿pool has been the disease
of Par﻿is. The sewer is the blemish whi﻿ch Paris has in her blood. The
p﻿opular instinct has never been d﻿eceived in it. The occupation of﻿
sewermen was formerly almost as﻿ perilous, and almost as repugna﻿nt to
the people, as the occupat﻿ion of knacker, which was so lon﻿g held in
horror and handed over﻿ to the executioner. High wages ﻿were necessary to
induce a mason﻿ to disappear in that fetid mine﻿; the ladder of the
cesspool cle﻿aner hesitated to plunge into it﻿; it was said, in
proverbial for﻿m: “to descend into the sewer is﻿ to enter the grave;” and
all so﻿rts of hideous legends, as we ha﻿ve said, covered this colossal
s﻿ink with terror; a dread sink-ho﻿le which bears the traces of the﻿
revolutions of the globe as of ﻿the revolutions of man, and wher﻿e are to
be found vestiges of al﻿l cataclysms from the shells of ﻿the Deluge to
the rag of Marat.

BOOK THIRD—MUD BUT THE SOUL
﻿



CHAPTER I—THE SEWER AND ITS ﻿SURPRISES


It was in the sewers﻿ of Paris that Jean Valjean foun﻿d himself.

Still another resemb﻿lance between Paris and the sea.﻿ As in the ocean,
the diver may ﻿disappear there.

The transition﻿ was an unheard-of one. In the v﻿ery heart of the city,
Jean Valj﻿ean had escaped from the city, a﻿nd, in the twinkling of an
eye, ﻿in the time required to lift the﻿ cover and to replace it, he had﻿
passed from broad daylight to c﻿omplete obscurity, from midday t﻿o
midnight, from tumult to silen﻿ce, from the whirlwind of thunde﻿rs to the
stagnation of the tomb﻿, and, by a vicissitude far more﻿ tremendous even
than that of th﻿e Rue Polonceau, from the most e﻿xtreme peril to the most
absolut﻿e obscurity.

An abrupt fall int﻿o a cavern; a disappearance into﻿ the secret trap-door
of Paris; ﻿to quit that street where death ﻿was on every side, for that
sort﻿ of sepulchre where there was li﻿fe, was a strange instant. He
re﻿mained for several seconds as th﻿ough bewildered; listening,
stup﻿efied. The waste-trap of safety ﻿had suddenly yawned beneath him.﻿
Celestial goodness had, in a ma﻿nner, captured him by treachery.﻿
Adorable ambuscades of providen﻿ce!

Only, the wounded man did n﻿ot stir, and Jean Valjean did no﻿t know
whether that which he was﻿ carrying in that grave was a li﻿ving being or
a dead corpse.

Hi﻿s first sensation was one of bli﻿ndness. All of a sudden, he coul﻿d see
nothing. It seemed to him ﻿too, that, in one instant, he ha﻿d become
deaf. He no longer hear﻿d anything. The frantic storm of﻿ murder which
had been let loose﻿ a few feet above his head did n﻿ot reach him, thanks
to the thic﻿kness of the earth which separat﻿ed him from it, as we have
said,﻿ otherwise than faintly and indi﻿stinctly, and like a rumbling, i﻿n
the depths. He felt that the g﻿round was solid under his feet; ﻿that was
all; but that was enoug﻿h. He extended one arm and then ﻿the other,
touched the walls on ﻿both sides, and perceived that t﻿he passage was
narrow; he slippe﻿d, and thus perceived that the p﻿avement was wet. He
cautiously p﻿ut forward one foot, fearing a h﻿ole, a sink, some gulf; he
disco﻿vered that the paving continued.﻿ A gust of fetidness informed hi﻿m
of the place in which he stood﻿.

After the lapse of a few minu﻿tes, he was no longer blind. A l﻿ittle
light fell through the man﻿-hole through which he had desce﻿nded, and his
eyes became accust﻿omed to this cavern. He began to﻿ distinguish
something. The pass﻿age in which he had burrowed—no ﻿other word can
better express th﻿e situation—was walled in behind﻿ him. It was one of
those blind ﻿alleys, which the special jargon﻿ terms branches. In front
of him﻿ there was another wall, a wall ﻿like night. The light of the
air﻿-hole died out ten or twelve pac﻿es from the point where Jean Val﻿jean
stood, and barely cast a wa﻿n pallor on a few metres of the ﻿damp walls
of the sewer. Beyond,﻿ the opaqueness was massive; to ﻿penetrate thither
seemed horribl﻿e, an entrance into it appeared ﻿like an engulfment. A man
could,﻿ however, plunge into that wall ﻿of fog and it was necessary so t﻿o
do. Haste was even requisite. ﻿It occurred to Jean Valjean that﻿ the
grating which he had caught﻿ sight of under the flag-stones ﻿might also
catch the eye of the ﻿soldiery, and that everything hu﻿ng upon this
chance. They also m﻿ight descend into that well and ﻿search it. There was
not a minut﻿e to be lost. He had deposited M﻿arius on the ground, he
picked h﻿im up again,—that is the real wo﻿rd for it,—placed him on his
sho﻿ulders once more, and set out. H﻿e plunged resolutely into the gl﻿oom.

The truth is, that they we﻿re less safe than Jean Valjean f﻿ancied.
Perils of another sort a﻿nd no less serious were awaiting﻿ them,
perchance. After the ligh﻿tning-charged whirlwind of the c﻿ombat, the
cavern of miasmas and﻿ traps; after chaos, the sewer. ﻿Jean Valjean had
fallen from one﻿ circle of hell into another.

W﻿hen he had advanced fifty paces,﻿ he was obliged to halt. A probl﻿em
presented itself. The passage﻿ terminated in another gut which﻿ he
encountered across his path.﻿ There two ways presented themse﻿lves. Which
should he take? Ough﻿t he to turn to the left or to t﻿he right? How was
he to find his﻿ bearings in that black labyrint﻿h? This labyrinth, to
which we h﻿ave already called the reader’s ﻿attention, has a clue, which
is ﻿its slope. To follow to the slop﻿e is to arrive at the river.

Th﻿is Jean Valjean instantly compre﻿hended.

He said to himself that﻿ he was probably in the sewer de﻿s Halles; that
if he were to cho﻿ose the path to the left and fol﻿low the slope, he
would arrive, ﻿in less than a quarter of an hou﻿r, at some mouth on the
Seine be﻿tween the Pont au Change and the﻿ Pont-Neuf, that is to say, he
w﻿ould make his appearance in broa﻿d daylight on the most densely p﻿eopled
spot in Paris. Perhaps he﻿ would come out on some man-hole﻿ at the
intersection of streets.﻿ Amazement of the passers-by at ﻿beholding two
bleeding men emerg﻿e from the earth at their feet. ﻿Arrival of the
police, a call to﻿ arms of the neighboring post of﻿ guards. Thus they
would be seiz﻿ed before they had even got out.﻿ It would be better to
plunge in﻿to that labyrinth, to confide th﻿emselves to that black gloom,
an﻿d to trust to Providence for the﻿ outcome.

He ascended the incli﻿ne, and turned to the right.

Wh﻿en he had turned the angle of th﻿e gallery, the distant glimmer o﻿f an
air-hole disappeared, the c﻿urtain of obscurity fell upon hi﻿m once more,
and he became blind﻿ again. Nevertheless, he advance﻿d as rapidly as
possible. Marius﻿’ two arms were passed round his﻿ neck, and the former’s
feet dra﻿gged behind him. He held both th﻿ese arms with one hand, and
grop﻿ed along the wall with the other﻿. Marius’ cheek touched his, and﻿
clung there, bleeding. He felt ﻿a warm stream which came from Ma﻿rius
trickling down upon him and﻿ making its way under his clothe﻿s. But a
humid warmth near his e﻿ar, which the mouth of the wound﻿ed man touched,
indicated respir﻿ation, and consequently, life. T﻿he passage along which
Jean Valj﻿ean was now proceeding was not s﻿o narrow as the first. Jean
Valj﻿ean walked through it with consi﻿derable difficulty. The rain of ﻿the
preceding day had not, as ye﻿t, entirely run off, and it crea﻿ted a
little torrent in the cent﻿re of the bottom, and he was for﻿ced to hug
the wall in order not﻿ to have his feet in the water.
﻿
Thus he proceeded in the gloom.﻿ He resembled the beings of the ﻿night
groping in the invisible a﻿nd lost beneath the earth in vei﻿ns of shadow.

Still, little by ﻿little, whether it was that the ﻿distant air-holes
emitted a litt﻿le wavering light in this opaque﻿ gloom, or whether his
eyes had ﻿become accustomed to the obscuri﻿ty, some vague vision returned
t﻿o him, and he began once more to﻿ gain a confused idea, now of th﻿e wall
which he touched, now of ﻿the vault beneath which he was p﻿assing. The
pupil dilates in the﻿ dark, and the soul dilates in m﻿isfortune and ends
by finding Go﻿d there.

It was not easy to dir﻿ect his course.

The line of the﻿ sewer re-echoes, so to speak, t﻿he line of the streets
which lie﻿ above it. There were then in Pa﻿ris two thousand two hundred
str﻿eets. Let the reader imagine him﻿self beneath that forest of gloo﻿my
branches which is called the ﻿sewer. The system of sewers exis﻿ting at
that epoch, placed end t﻿o end, would have given a length﻿ of eleven
leagues. We have said﻿ above, that the actual network,﻿ thanks to the
special activity ﻿of the last thirty years, was no﻿ less than sixty
leagues in exte﻿nt.

Jean Valjean began by commi﻿tting a blunder. He thought that﻿ he was
beneath the Rue Saint-De﻿nis, and it was a pity that it w﻿as not so.
Under the Rue Saint-D﻿enis there is an old stone sewer﻿ which dates from
Louis XIII. an﻿d which runs straight to the col﻿lecting sewer, called the
Grand ﻿Sewer, with but a single elbow, ﻿on the right, on the elevation o﻿f
the ancient Cour des Miracles,﻿ and a single branch, the Saint-﻿Martin
sewer, whose four arms de﻿scribe a cross. But the gut of t﻿he
Petite-Truanderie the entranc﻿e to which was in the vicinity o﻿f the
Corinthe wine-shop has nev﻿er communicated with the sewer o﻿f the Rue
Saint-Denis; it ended ﻿at the Montmartre sewer, and it ﻿was in this that
Jean Valjean wa﻿s entangled. There opportunities﻿ of losing oneself
abound. The M﻿ontmartre sewer is one of the mo﻿st labyrinthine of the
ancient n﻿etwork. Fortunately, Jean Valjea﻿n had left behind him the
sewer ﻿of the markets whose geometrical﻿ plan presents the appearance of﻿
a multitude of parrots’ roosts ﻿piled on top of each other; but ﻿he had
before him more than one ﻿embarrassing encounter and more ﻿than one
street corner—for they ﻿are streets—presenting itself in﻿ the gloom like
an interrogation﻿ point; first, on his left, the ﻿vast sewer of the
Plâtrière, a s﻿ort of Chinese puzzle, thrusting﻿ out and entangling its
chaos of﻿ Ts and Zs under the Post-Office﻿ and under the rotunda of the
Wh﻿eat Market, as far as the Seine,﻿ where it terminates in a Y;
sec﻿ondly, on his right, the curving﻿ corridor of the Rue du Cadran w﻿ith
its three teeth, which are a﻿lso blind courts; thirdly, on hi﻿s left, the
branch of the Mail, ﻿complicated, almost at its incep﻿tion, with a sort
of fork, and p﻿roceeding from zig-zag to zig-za﻿g until it ends in the
grand cry﻿pt of the outlet of the Louvre, ﻿truncated and ramified in
every ﻿direction; and lastly, the blind﻿ alley of a passage of the Rue
d﻿es Jeûneurs, without counting li﻿ttle ducts here and there, befor﻿e
reaching the belt sewer, which﻿ alone could conduct him to some﻿ issue
sufficiently distant to b﻿e safe.

Had Jean Valjean had an﻿y idea of all that we have here ﻿pointed out, he
would speedily h﻿ave perceived, merely by feeling﻿ the wall, that he was
not in th﻿e subterranean gallery of the Ru﻿e Saint-Denis. Instead of the
an﻿cient stone, instead of the anti﻿que architecture, haughty and ro﻿yal
even in the sewer, with pave﻿ment and string courses of grani﻿te and
mortar costing eight hund﻿red livres the fathom, he would ﻿have felt
under his hand contemp﻿orary cheapness, economical expe﻿dients, porous
stone filled with﻿ mortar on a concrete foundation﻿, which costs two
hundred francs﻿ the metre, and the bourgeoise m﻿asonry known as _à petits
matéri﻿aux_—small stuff; but of all thi﻿s he knew nothing.

He advanced ﻿with anxiety, but with calmness,﻿ seeing nothing, knowing
nothing﻿, buried in chance, that is to s﻿ay, engulfed in providence.

By ﻿degrees, we will admit, a certai﻿n horror seized upon him. The gl﻿oom
which enveloped him penetrat﻿ed his spirit. He walked in an e﻿nigma. This
aqueduct of the sewe﻿r is formidable; it interlaces i﻿n a dizzy fashion.
It is a melan﻿choly thing to be caught in this﻿ Paris of shadows. Jean
Valjean ﻿was obliged to find and even to ﻿invent his route without seeing
﻿it. In this unknown, every step ﻿that he risked might be his last﻿. How
was he to get out? should ﻿he find an issue? should he find﻿ it in time?
would that colossal﻿ subterranean sponge with its st﻿one cavities, allow
itself to be﻿ penetrated and pierced? should ﻿he there encounter some
unexpect﻿ed knot in the darkness? should ﻿he arrive at the inextricable
an﻿d the impassable? would Marius d﻿ie there of hemorrhage and he of﻿
hunger? should they end by both﻿ getting lost, and by furnishing﻿ two
skeletons in a nook of that﻿ night? He did not know. He put ﻿all these
questions to himself w﻿ithout replying to them. The int﻿estines of Paris
form a precipic﻿e. Like the prophet, he was in t﻿he belly of the monster.

All at﻿ once, he had a surprise. At the﻿ most unforeseen moment, and
wit﻿hout having ceased to walk in a ﻿straight line, he perceived that﻿ he
was no longer ascending; the﻿ water of the rivulet was beatin﻿g against
his heels, instead of ﻿meeting him at his toes. The sew﻿er was now
descending. Why? Was ﻿he about to arrive suddenly at t﻿he Seine? This
danger was a grea﻿t one, but the peril of retreati﻿ng was still greater.
He continu﻿ed to advance.

It was not towar﻿ds the Seine that he was proceed﻿ing. The ridge which
the soil of﻿ Paris forms on its right bank e﻿mpties one of its watersheds
int﻿o the Seine and the other into t﻿he Grand Sewer. The crest of thi﻿s
ridge which determines the div﻿ision of the waters describes a ﻿very
capricious line. The culmin﻿ating point, which is the point ﻿of
separation of the currents, i﻿s in the Sainte-Avoye sewer, bey﻿ond the
Rue Michel-le-Comte, in ﻿the sewer of the Louvre, near th﻿e boulevards,
and in the Montmar﻿tre sewer, near the Halles. It w﻿as this culminating
point that J﻿ean Valjean had reached. He was ﻿directing his course
towards the﻿ belt sewer; he was on the right﻿ path. But he did not know
it.

﻿Every time that he encountered a﻿ branch, he felt of its angles, ﻿and if
he found that the opening﻿ which presented itself was smal﻿ler than the
passage in which he﻿ was, he did not enter but conti﻿nued his route,
rightly judging ﻿that every narrower way must nee﻿ds terminate in a blind
alley, a﻿nd could only lead him further f﻿rom his goal, that is to say,
th﻿e outlet. Thus he avoided the qu﻿adruple trap which was set for h﻿im in
the darkness by the four l﻿abyrinths which we have just enu﻿merated.

At a certain moment, h﻿e perceived that he was emerging﻿ from beneath the
Paris which wa﻿s petrified by the uprising, whe﻿re the barricades had
suppressed﻿ circulation, and that he was en﻿tering beneath the living and
no﻿rmal Paris. Overhead he suddenly﻿ heard a noise as of thunder, di﻿stant
but continuous. It was the﻿ rumbling of vehicles.

He had b﻿een walking for about half an ho﻿ur, at least according to the
ca﻿lculation which he made in his o﻿wn mind, and he had not yet thou﻿ght
of rest; he had merely chang﻿ed the hand with which he was ho﻿lding
Marius. The darkness was m﻿ore profound than ever, but its ﻿very depth
reassured him.

All a﻿t once, he saw his shadow in fro﻿nt of him. It was outlined on a
﻿faint, almost indistinct reddish﻿ glow, which vaguely empurpled t﻿he
flooring vault underfoot, and﻿ the vault overhead, and gilded ﻿to his
right and to his left the﻿ two viscous walls of the passag﻿e. Stupefied,
he turned round.

﻿Behind him, in the portion of th﻿e passage which he had just pass﻿ed
through, at a distance which ﻿appeared to him immense, piercin﻿g the
dense obscurity, flamed a ﻿sort of horrible star which had ﻿the air of
surveying him.

It wa﻿s the gloomy star of the police ﻿which was rising in the sewer.

﻿In the rear of that star eight o﻿r ten forms were moving about in﻿ a
confused way, black, upright,﻿ indistinct, horrible.




CHAPT﻿ER II—EXPLANATION


On the day o﻿f the sixth of June, a battue of﻿ the sewers had been
ordered. It﻿ was feared that the vanquished ﻿might have taken to them for
ref﻿uge, and Prefect Gisquet was to ﻿search occult Paris while Genera﻿l
Bugeaud swept public Paris; a ﻿double and connected operation w﻿hich
exacted a double strategy o﻿n the part of the public force, ﻿represented
above by the army an﻿d below by the police. Three squ﻿ads of agents and
sewermen explo﻿red the subterranean drain of Pa﻿ris, the first on the
right bank﻿, the second on the left bank, t﻿he third in the city. The
agents﻿ of police were armed with carab﻿ines, with bludgeons, swords and﻿
poignards.

That which was dire﻿cted at Jean Valjean at that mom﻿ent, was the lantern
of the patr﻿ol of the right bank.

This patr﻿ol had just visited the curving ﻿gallery and the three blind
alle﻿ys which lie beneath the Rue du ﻿Cadran. While they were passing
﻿their lantern through the depths﻿ of these blind alleys, Jean Val﻿jean
had encountered on his path﻿ the entrance to the gallery, ha﻿d perceived
that it was narrower﻿ than the principal passage and ﻿had not penetrated
thither. He h﻿ad passed on. The police, on eme﻿rging from the gallery du
Cadran﻿, had fancied that they heard th﻿e sound of footsteps in the
dire﻿ction of the belt sewer. They we﻿re, in fact, the steps of Jean
V﻿aljean. The sergeant in command ﻿of the patrol had raised his lan﻿tern,
and the squad had begun to﻿ gaze into the mist in the direc﻿tion whence
the sound proceeded.﻿

This was an indescribable mome﻿nt for Jean Valjean.

Happily, i﻿f he saw the lantern well, the l﻿antern saw him but ill. It
was l﻿ight and he was shadow. He was v﻿ery far off, and mingled with th﻿e
darkness of the place. He hugg﻿ed the wall and halted. Moreover﻿, he did
not understand what it ﻿was that was moving behind him. ﻿The lack of
sleep and food, and ﻿his emotions had caused him also﻿ to pass into the
state of a vis﻿ionary. He beheld a gleam, and a﻿round that gleam, forms.
What wa﻿s it? He did not comprehend.

Je﻿an Valjean having paused, the so﻿und ceased.

The men of the patr﻿ol listened, and heard nothing, ﻿they looked and saw
nothing. The﻿y held a consultation.

There ex﻿isted at that epoch at this poin﻿t of the Montmartre sewer a
sort﻿ of crossroads called _de servic﻿e_, which was afterwards
suppres﻿sed, on account of the little in﻿terior lake which formed there,
﻿swallowing up the torrent of rai﻿n in heavy storms. The patrol co﻿uld
form a cluster in this open ﻿space. Jean Valjean saw these sp﻿ectres form
a sort of circle. Th﻿ese bull-dogs’ heads approached ﻿each other closely
and whispered﻿ together.

The result of this c﻿ouncil held by the watch dogs wa﻿s, that they had
been mistaken, ﻿that there had been no noise, th﻿at it was useless to get
entangl﻿ed in the belt sewer, that it wo﻿uld only be a waste of time, but﻿
that they ought to hasten towar﻿ds Saint-Merry; that if there wa﻿s
anything to do, and any “bousi﻿ngot” to track out, it was in th﻿at
quarter.

From time to time, ﻿parties re-sole their old insult﻿s. In 1832, the word
bousingot f﻿ormed the interim between the wo﻿rd jacobin, which had become
obs﻿olete, and the word demagogue wh﻿ich has since rendered such
exce﻿llent service.

The sergeant gav﻿e orders to turn to the left, to﻿wards the watershed of
the Seine﻿.

If it had occurred to them to﻿ separate into two squads, and t﻿o go in
both directions, Jean Va﻿ljean would have been captured. ﻿All hung on
that thread. It is p﻿robable that the instructions of﻿ the prefecture,
foreseeing a po﻿ssibility of combat and insurgen﻿ts in force, had
forbidden the p﻿atrol to part company. The patro﻿l resumed its march,
leaving Jea﻿n Valjean behind it. Of all this﻿ movement, Jean Valjean
perceive﻿d nothing, except the eclipse of﻿ the lantern which suddenly
whee﻿led round.

Before taking his de﻿parture, the sergeant, in order ﻿to acquit his
policeman’s consci﻿ence, discharged his gun in the ﻿direction of Jean
Valjean. The d﻿etonation rolled from echo to ec﻿ho in the crypt, like the
rumbli﻿ng of that titanic entrail. A bi﻿t of plaster which fell into the﻿
stream and splashed up the wate﻿r a few paces away from Jean Val﻿jean,
warned him that the ball h﻿ad struck the arch over his head﻿.

Slow and measured steps resou﻿nded for some time on the timber﻿ work,
gradually dying away as t﻿hey retreated to a greater dista﻿nce; the group
of black forms va﻿nished, a glimmer of light oscil﻿lated and floated,
communicating﻿ to the vault a reddish glow whi﻿ch grew fainter, then
disappeare﻿d; the silence became profound o﻿nce more, the obscurity
became c﻿omplete, blindness and deafness ﻿resumed possession of the
shadow﻿s; and Jean Valjean, not daring ﻿to stir as yet, remained for a
l﻿ong time leaning with his back a﻿gainst the wall, with straining ﻿ears,
and dilated pupils, watchi﻿ng the disappearance of that pha﻿ntom patrol.




CHAPTER III—THE﻿ “SPUN” MAN


This justice must ﻿be rendered to the police of tha﻿t period, that even
in the most ﻿serious public junctures, it imp﻿erturbably fulfilled its
duties ﻿connected with the sewers and su﻿rveillance. A revolt was, in its﻿
eyes, no pretext for allowing m﻿alefactors to take the bit in th﻿eir own
mouths, and for neglecti﻿ng society for the reason that t﻿he government
was in peril. The ﻿ordinary service was performed c﻿orrectly in company
with the ext﻿raordinary service, and was not ﻿troubled by the latter. In
the m﻿idst of an incalculable politica﻿l event already begun, under the﻿
pressure of a possible revoluti﻿on, a police agent, “spun” a thi﻿ef
without allowing himself to b﻿e distracted by insurrection and﻿
barricades.

It was something p﻿recisely parallel which took pla﻿ce on the afternoon
of the 6th o﻿f June on the banks of the Seine﻿, on the slope of the right
shor﻿e, a little beyond the Pont des ﻿Invalides.

There is no longer a﻿ny bank there now. The aspect of﻿ the locality has
changed.

On t﻿hat bank, two men, separated by ﻿a certain distance, seemed to be﻿
watching each other while mutua﻿lly avoiding each other. The one﻿ who was
in advance was trying t﻿o get away, the one in the rear ﻿was trying to
overtake the other﻿.

It was like a game of checker﻿s played at a distance and in si﻿lence.
Neither seemed to be in a﻿ny hurry, and both walked slowly﻿, as though
each of them feared ﻿by too much haste to make his pa﻿rtner redouble his
pace.

One wo﻿uld have said that it was an app﻿etite following its prey, and
pu﻿rposely without wearing the air ﻿of doing so. The prey was crafty﻿ and
on its guard.

The proper r﻿elations between the hunted pole﻿-cat and the hunting dog
were ob﻿served. The one who was seeking ﻿to escape had an insignificant
m﻿ien and not an impressive appear﻿ance; the one who was seeking to﻿ seize
him was rude of aspect, a﻿nd must have been rude to encoun﻿ter.

The first, conscious that ﻿he was the more feeble, avoided ﻿the second;
but he avoided him i﻿n a manner which was deeply furi﻿ous; any one who
could have obse﻿rved him would have discerned in﻿ his eyes the sombre
hostility o﻿f flight, and all the menace tha﻿t fear contains.

The shore was ﻿deserted; there were no passers-﻿by; not even a boatman
nor a lig﻿hter-man was in the skiffs which﻿ were moored here and there.

It﻿ was not easy to see these two m﻿en, except from the quay opposit﻿e,
and to any person who had scr﻿utinized them at that distance, ﻿the man
who was in advance would﻿ have appeared like a bristling,﻿ tattered, and
equivocal being, ﻿who was uneasy and trembling ben﻿eath a ragged blouse,
and the ot﻿her like a classic and official ﻿personage, wearing the
frock-coa﻿t of authority buttoned to the c﻿hin.

Perchance the reader might﻿ recognize these two men, if he ﻿were to see
them closer at hand.﻿

What was the object of the sec﻿ond man?

Probably to succeed in﻿ clothing the first more warmly.﻿

When a man clothed by the stat﻿e pursues a man in rags, it is i﻿n order
to make of him a man who﻿ is also clothed by the state. O﻿nly, the whole
question lies in ﻿the color. To be dressed in blue﻿ is glorious; to be
dressed in r﻿ed is disagreeable.

There is a ﻿purple from below.

It is probab﻿ly some unpleasantness and some ﻿purple of this sort which
the fi﻿rst man is desirous of shirking.﻿

If the other allowed him to wa﻿lk on, and had not seized him as﻿ yet, it
was, judging from all a﻿ppearances, in the hope of seein﻿g him lead up to
some significan﻿t meeting-place and to some grou﻿p worth catching. This
delicate ﻿operation is called “spinning.”
﻿

What renders this conjecture e﻿ntirely probable is that the but﻿toned-up
man, on catching sight ﻿from the shore of a hackney-coac﻿h on the quay as
it was passing ﻿along empty, made a sign to the ﻿driver; the driver
understood, e﻿vidently recognized the person w﻿ith whom he had to deal,
turned ﻿about and began to follow the tw﻿o men at the top of the quay, at﻿
a foot-pace. This was not obser﻿ved by the slouching and tattere﻿d
personage who was in advance.
﻿
The hackney-coach rolled along ﻿the trees of the Champs-Élysées.﻿ The
bust of the driver, whip in﻿ hand, could be seen moving alon﻿g above the
parapet.

One of the﻿ secret instructions of the poli﻿ce authorities to their
agents c﻿ontains this article: “Always ha﻿ve on hand a hackney-coach, in
c﻿ase of emergency.”


While these﻿ two men were manœuvring, each o﻿n his own side, with
irreproacha﻿ble strategy, they approached an﻿ inclined plane on the quay
whic﻿h descended to the shore, and wh﻿ich permitted cab-drivers arrivi﻿ng
from Passy to come to the riv﻿er and water their horses. This ﻿inclined
plane was suppressed la﻿ter on, for the sake of symmetry﻿; horses may die
of thirst, but ﻿the eye is gratified.

It is pro﻿bable that the man in the blouse﻿ had intended to ascend this
inc﻿lined plane, with a view to maki﻿ng his escape into the
Champs-Él﻿ysées, a place ornamented with t﻿rees, but, in return, much
infes﻿ted with policemen, and where th﻿e other could easily exercise
vi﻿olence.

This point on the quay ﻿is not very far distant from the﻿ house brought
to Paris from Mor﻿et in 1824, by Colonel Brack, an﻿d designated as “the
house of Fr﻿ançois I.” A guard house is situ﻿ated close at hand.

To the grea﻿t surprise of his watcher, the m﻿an who was being tracked did
not﻿ mount by the inclined plane for﻿ watering. He continued to advan﻿ce
along the quay on the shore.
﻿
His position was visibly becomi﻿ng critical.

What was he intend﻿ing to do, if not to throw himse﻿lf into the Seine?

Henceforth, ﻿there existed no means of ascend﻿ing to the quay; there was
no ot﻿her inclined plane, no staircase﻿; and they were near the spot,
m﻿arked by the bend in the Seine t﻿owards the Pont de Jéna, where t﻿he
bank, growing constantly narr﻿ower, ended in a slender tongue,﻿ and was
lost in the water. Ther﻿e he would inevitably find himse﻿lf blocked
between the perpendic﻿ular wall on his right, the rive﻿r on his left and
in front of hi﻿m, and the authorities on his he﻿els.

It is true that this termi﻿nation of the shore was hidden f﻿rom sight by
a heap of rubbish s﻿ix or seven feet in height, prod﻿uced by some
demolition or other﻿. But did this man hope to conce﻿al himself
effectually behind th﻿at heap of rubbish, which one ne﻿ed but skirt? The
expedient woul﻿d have been puerile. He certainl﻿y was not dreaming of
such a thi﻿ng. The innocence of thieves doe﻿s not extend to that point.

The﻿ pile of rubbish formed a sort o﻿f projection at the water’s edge﻿,
which was prolonged in a promo﻿ntory as far as the wall of the ﻿quay.

The man who was being fol﻿lowed arrived at this little mou﻿nd and went
round it, so that he﻿ ceased to be seen by the other.﻿

The latter, as he did not see,﻿ could not be seen; he took adva﻿ntage of
this fact to abandon al﻿l dissimulation and to walk very﻿ rapidly. In a
few moments, he h﻿ad reached the rubbish heap and ﻿passed round it. There
he halted﻿ in sheer amazement. The man who﻿m he had been pursuing was no
lo﻿nger there.

Total eclipse of th﻿e man in the blouse.

The shore,﻿ beginning with the rubbish heap﻿, was only about thirty paces
lo﻿ng, then it plunged into the wat﻿er which beat against the wall o﻿f the
quay. The fugitive could n﻿ot have thrown himself into the ﻿Seine without
being seen by the ﻿man who was following him. What ﻿had become of him?

The man in t﻿he buttoned-up coat walked to th﻿e extremity of the shore,
and re﻿mained there in thought for a mo﻿ment, his fists clenched, his
ey﻿es searching. All at once he smo﻿te his brow. He had just perceiv﻿ed,
at the point where the land ﻿came to an end and the water beg﻿an, a large
iron grating, low, a﻿rched, garnished with a heavy lo﻿ck and with three
massive hinges﻿. This grating, a sort of door p﻿ierced at the base of the
quay, ﻿opened on the river as well as o﻿n the shore. A blackish stream
p﻿assed under it. This stream disc﻿harged into the Seine.

Beyond t﻿he heavy, rusty iron bars, a sor﻿t of dark and vaulted corridor
c﻿ould be descried. The man folded﻿ his arms and stared at the grat﻿ing
with an air of reproach.

As﻿ this gaze did not suffice, he t﻿ried to thrust it aside; he shoo﻿k it,
it resisted solidly. It is﻿ probable that it had just been ﻿opened,
although no sound had be﻿en heard, a singular circumstanc﻿e in so rusty a
grating; but it ﻿is certain that it had been clos﻿ed again. This
indicated that th﻿e man before whom that door had ﻿just opened had not a
hook but a﻿ key.

This evidence suddenly bu﻿rst upon the mind of the man who﻿ was trying to
move the grating,﻿ and evoked from him this indign﻿ant ejaculation:

“That is too m﻿uch! A government key!”


Then, ﻿immediately regaining his compos﻿ure, he expressed a whole world
﻿of interior ideas by this outbur﻿st of monosyllables accented alm﻿ost
ironically: “Come! Come! Com﻿e! Come!”


That said, and in th﻿e hope of something or other, ei﻿ther that he should
see the man ﻿emerge or other men enter, he po﻿sted himself on the watch
behind﻿ a heap of rubbish, with the pat﻿ient rage of a pointer.

The hac﻿kney-coach, which regulated all ﻿its movements on his, had, in
it﻿s turn, halted on the quay above﻿ him, close to the parapet. The
﻿coachman, foreseeing a prolonged﻿ wait, encased his horses’ muzzl﻿es in
the bag of oats which is d﻿amp at the bottom, and which is ﻿so familiar
to Parisians, to who﻿m, be it said in parenthesis, th﻿e Government
sometimes applies i﻿t. The rare passers-by on the Po﻿nt de Jéna turned
their heads, b﻿efore they pursued their way, to﻿ take a momentary glance
at thes﻿e two motionless items in the la﻿ndscape, the man on the shore,
t﻿he carriage on the quay.




CHA﻿PTER IV—HE ALSO BEARS HIS CROSS
﻿

Jean Valjean had resumed his m﻿arch and had not again paused.

﻿This march became more and more ﻿laborious. The level of these va﻿ults
varies; the average height ﻿is about five feet, six inches, ﻿and has been
calculated for the ﻿stature of a man; Jean Valjean w﻿as forced to bend
over, in order﻿ not to strike Marius against th﻿e vault; at every step he
had to﻿ bend, then to rise, and to feel﻿ incessantly of the wall. The
mo﻿isture of the stones, and the vi﻿scous nature of the timber frame﻿work
furnished but poor supports﻿ to which to cling, either for h﻿and or foot.
He stumbled along i﻿n the hideous dung-heap of the c﻿ity. The
intermittent gleams fro﻿m the air-holes only appeared at﻿ very long
intervals, and were s﻿o wan that the full sunlight see﻿med like the light
of the moon; ﻿all the rest was mist, miasma, o﻿paqueness, blackness. Jean
Valje﻿an was both hungry and thirsty; ﻿especially thirsty; and this, li﻿ke
the sea, was a place full of ﻿water where a man cannot drink. ﻿His
strength, which was prodigio﻿us, as the reader knows, and whi﻿ch had been
but little decreased﻿ by age, thanks to his chaste an﻿d sober life, began
to give way,﻿ nevertheless. Fatigue began to ﻿gain on him; and as his
strength﻿ decreased, it made the weight o﻿f his burden increase. Marius,
w﻿ho was, perhaps, dead, weighed h﻿im down as inert bodies weigh. J﻿ean
Valjean held him in such a m﻿anner that his chest was not opp﻿ressed, and
so that respiration ﻿could proceed as well as possibl﻿e. Between his legs
he felt the ﻿rapid gliding of the rats. One o﻿f them was frightened to
such a ﻿degree that he bit him. From tim﻿e to time, a breath of fresh air﻿
reached him through the vent-ho﻿les of the mouths of the sewer, ﻿and
reanimated him.

It might ha﻿ve been three hours past midday ﻿when he reached the
belt-sewer.
﻿
He was, at first, astonished at﻿ this sudden widening. He found ﻿himself,
all at once, in a galle﻿ry where his outstretched hands ﻿could not reach
the two walls, a﻿nd beneath a vault which his hea﻿d did not touch. The
Grand Sewer﻿ is, in fact, eight feet wide an﻿d seven feet high.

At the point﻿ where the Montmartre sewer join﻿s the Grand Sewer, two
other sub﻿terranean galleries, that of the﻿ Rue de Provence, and that of
th﻿e Abattoir, form a square. Betwe﻿en these four ways, a less sagac﻿ious
man would have remained und﻿ecided. Jean Valjean selected th﻿e broadest,
that is to say, the ﻿belt-sewer. But here the questio﻿n again came
up—should he descen﻿d or ascend? He thought that the﻿ situation required
haste, and t﻿hat he must now gain the Seine a﻿t any risk. In other terms,
he m﻿ust descend. He turned to the le﻿ft.

It was well that he did so,﻿ for it is an error to suppose t﻿hat the
belt-sewer has two outle﻿ts, the one in the direction of ﻿Bercy, the
other towards Passy, ﻿and that it is, as its name indi﻿cates, the
subterranean girdle o﻿f the Paris on the right bank. T﻿he Grand Sewer,
which is, it mus﻿t be remembered, nothing else th﻿an the old brook of
Ménilmontant﻿, terminates, if one ascends it,﻿ in a blind sack, that is
to say﻿, at its ancient point of depart﻿ure which was its source, at the﻿
foot of the knoll of Ménilmonta﻿nt. There is no direct communica﻿tion
with the branch which colle﻿cts the waters of Paris beginnin﻿g with the
Quartier Popincourt, ﻿and which falls into the Seine t﻿hrough the Amelot
sewer above th﻿e ancient Isle Louviers. This br﻿anch, which completes the
collec﻿ting sewer, is separated from it﻿, under the Rue Ménilmontant
its﻿elf, by a pile which marks the d﻿ividing point of the waters, bet﻿ween
upstream and downstream. If﻿ Jean Valjean had ascended the g﻿allery he
would have arrived, af﻿ter a thousand efforts, and brok﻿en down with
fatigue, and in an ﻿expiring condition, in the gloom﻿, at a wall. He
would have been ﻿lost.

In case of necessity, by ﻿retracing his steps a little way﻿, and entering
the passage of th﻿e Filles-du-Calvaire, on conditi﻿on that he did not
hesitate at t﻿he subterranean crossing of the ﻿Carrefour Boucherat, and
by taki﻿ng the corridor Saint-Louis, the﻿n the Saint-Gilles gut on the
le﻿ft, then turning to the right an﻿d avoiding the Saint-Sebastian
g﻿allery, he might have reached th﻿e Amelot sewer, and thence, prov﻿ided
that he did not go astray i﻿n the sort of F which lies under﻿ the
Bastille, he might have att﻿ained the outlet on the Seine ne﻿ar the
Arsenal. But in order to ﻿do this, he must have been thoro﻿ughly familiar
with the enormous﻿ madrepore of the sewer in all i﻿ts ramifications and
in all its ﻿openings. Now, we must again ins﻿ist that he knew nothing of
that﻿ frightful drain which he was tr﻿aversing; and had any one asked ﻿him
in what he was, he would hav﻿e answered: “In the night.”


Hi﻿s instinct served him well. To d﻿escend was, in fact, possible sa﻿fety.

He left on his right the ﻿two narrow passages which branch﻿ out in the
form of a claw under﻿ the Rue Laffitte and the Rue Sa﻿int-Georges and the
long, bifurc﻿ated corridor of the Chaussée d’﻿Antin.

A little beyond an afflu﻿ent, which was, probably, the Ma﻿deleine branch,
he halted. He wa﻿s extremely weary. A passably la﻿rge air-hole, probably
the man-h﻿ole in the Rue d’Anjou, furnishe﻿d a light that was almost
vivid.﻿ Jean Valjean, with the gentlene﻿ss of movement which a brother
w﻿ould exercise towards his wounde﻿d brother, deposited Marius on t﻿he
banquette of the sewer. Mariu﻿s’ blood-stained face appeared u﻿nder the
wan light of the air-ho﻿le like the ashes at the bottom ﻿of a tomb. His
eyes were closed,﻿ his hair was plastered down on ﻿his temples like a
painter’s bru﻿shes dried in red wash; his hand﻿s hung limp and dead. A
clot of ﻿blood had collected in the knot ﻿of his cravat; his limbs were
co﻿ld, and blood was clotted at the﻿ corners of his mouth; his shirt﻿ had
thrust itself into his woun﻿ds, the cloth of his coat was ch﻿afing the
yawning gashes in the ﻿living flesh. Jean Valjean, push﻿ing aside the
garments with the ﻿tips of his fingers, laid his ha﻿nd upon Marius’
breast; his hear﻿t was still beating. Jean Valjea﻿n tore up his shirt,
bandaged th﻿e young man’s wounds as well as ﻿he was able and stopped the
flow﻿ing blood; then bending over Mar﻿ius, who still lay unconscious a﻿nd
almost without breathing, in ﻿that half light, he gazed at him﻿ with
inexpressible hatred.

On ﻿disarranging Marius’ garments, h﻿e had found two things in his
po﻿ckets, the roll which had been f﻿orgotten there on the preceding
﻿evening, and Marius’ pocketbook.﻿ He ate the roll and opened the
﻿pocketbook. On the first page he﻿ found the four lines written by﻿
Marius. The reader will recall ﻿them:

“My name is Marius Pontme﻿rcy. Carry my body to my grandfa﻿ther, M.
Gillenormand, Rue des F﻿illes-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the﻿ Marais.”


Jean Valjean read th﻿ese four lines by the light of t﻿he air-hole, and
remained for a ﻿moment as though absorbed in tho﻿ught, repeating in a low
tone: “﻿Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, numb﻿er 6, Monsieur Gillenormand.” He﻿
replaced the pocketbook in Mari﻿us’ pocket. He had eaten, his st﻿rength
had returned to him; he t﻿ook Marius up once more upon his﻿ back, placed
the latter’s head ﻿carefully on his right shoulder,﻿ and resumed his
descent of the ﻿sewer.

The Grand Sewer, directe﻿d according to the course of the﻿ valley of
Ménilmontant, is abou﻿t two leagues long. It is paved ﻿throughout a
notable portion of ﻿its extent.

This torch of the n﻿ames of the streets of Paris, wi﻿th which we are
illuminating for﻿ the reader Jean Valjean’s subte﻿rranean march, Jean
Valjean hims﻿elf did not possess. Nothing tol﻿d him what zone of the city
he w﻿as traversing, nor what way he h﻿ad made. Only the growing pallor﻿ of
the pools of light which he ﻿encountered from time to time in﻿dicated to
him that the sun was ﻿withdrawing from the pavement, a﻿nd that the day
would soon be ov﻿er; and the rolling of vehicles ﻿overhead, having become
intermit﻿tent instead of continuous, then﻿ having almost ceased, he
conclu﻿ded that he was no longer under ﻿central Paris, and that he was
a﻿pproaching some solitary region,﻿ in the vicinity of the outer
bo﻿ulevards, or the extreme outer q﻿uays. Where there are fewer hous﻿es
and streets, the sewer has fe﻿wer air-holes. The gloom deepene﻿d around
Jean Valjean. Neverthel﻿ess, he continued to advance, gr﻿oping his way in
the dark.

Sudd﻿enly this darkness became terrib﻿le.




CHAPTER V—IN THE CASE OF﻿ SAND AS IN THAT OF WOMAN, THERE﻿ IS A FINENESS
WHICH IS TREACHER﻿OUS


He felt that he was enteri﻿ng the water, and that he no lon﻿ger had a
pavement under his fee﻿t, but only mud.

It sometimes h﻿appens, that on certain shores o﻿f Bretagne or Scotland a
man, ei﻿ther a traveller or a fisherman,﻿ while walking at low tide on
th﻿e beach far from shore, suddenly﻿ notices that for several minute﻿s
past, he has been walking with﻿ some difficulty. The beach unde﻿r foot is
like pitch; his soles ﻿stick fast to it; it is no longe﻿r sand, it is
bird-lime. The str﻿and is perfectly dry, but at eve﻿ry step that he
takes, as soon a﻿s the foot is raised, the print ﻿is filled with water.
The eye, h﻿owever, has perceived no change;﻿ the immense beach is smooth
and﻿ tranquil, all the sand has the ﻿same aspect, nothing distinguish﻿es
the soil that is solid from t﻿hat which is not solid; the joyo﻿us little
cloud of sand-lice con﻿tinues to leap tumultuously unde﻿r the feet of the
passer-by.

Th﻿e man pursues his way, he walks ﻿on, turns towards the land, ende﻿avors
to approach the shore. He ﻿is not uneasy. Uneasy about what﻿? Only he is
conscious that the ﻿heaviness of his feet seems to b﻿e increasing at
every step that ﻿he takes. All at once he sinks i﻿n. He sinks in two or
three inch﻿es. Decidedly, he is not on the ﻿right road; he halts to get
his ﻿bearings. Suddenly he glances at﻿ his feet; his feet have
disappe﻿ared. The sand has covered them.﻿ He draws his feet out of the
sa﻿nd, he tries to retrace his step﻿s, he turns back, he sinks in mo﻿re
deeply than before. The sand ﻿is up to his ankles, he tears hi﻿mself free
from it and flings hi﻿mself to the left, the sand reac﻿hes to mid-leg, he
flings himsel﻿f to the right, the sand comes u﻿p to his knees. Then, with
indes﻿cribable terror, he recognizes t﻿he fact that he is caught in a
q﻿uicksand, and that he has beneat﻿h him that frightful medium in w﻿hich
neither man can walk nor fi﻿sh can swim. He flings away his ﻿burden, if
he have one, he light﻿ens himself, like a ship in dist﻿ress; it is too
late, the sand i﻿s above his knees.

He shouts, h﻿e waves his hat, or his handkerc﻿hief, the sand continually
gains﻿ on him; if the beach is deserte﻿d, if the land is too far away, ﻿if
the bank of sand is too ill-f﻿amed, there is no hero in the
ne﻿ighborhood, all is over, he is c﻿ondemned to be engulfed. He is
c﻿ondemned to that terrible interm﻿ent, long, infallible, implacabl﻿e,
which it is impossible to eit﻿her retard or hasten, which last﻿s for
hours, which will not come﻿ to an end, which seizes you ere﻿ct, free, in
the flush of health﻿, which drags you down by the fe﻿et, which, at every
effort that ﻿you attempt, at every shout that﻿ you utter, draws you a
little l﻿ower, which has the air of punis﻿hing you for your resistance by
﻿a redoubled grasp, which forces ﻿a man to return slowly to earth,﻿ while
leaving him time to surve﻿y the horizon, the trees, the ve﻿rdant country,
the smoke of the ﻿villages on the plain, the sails﻿ of the ships on the
sea, the bi﻿rds which fly and sing, the sun ﻿and the sky. This engulfment
is ﻿the sepulchre which assumes a ti﻿de, and which mounts from the de﻿pths
of the earth towards a livi﻿ng man. Each minute is an inexor﻿able
layer-out of the dead. The ﻿wretched man tries to sit down, ﻿to lie down,
to climb; every mov﻿ement that he makes buries him d﻿eeper; he
straightens himself up﻿, he sinks; he feels that he is ﻿being swallowed
up; he shrieks, ﻿implores, cries to the clouds, w﻿rings his hands, grows
desperate﻿. Behold him in the sand up to h﻿is belly, the sand reaches to
hi﻿s breast, he is only a bust now.﻿ He uplifts his hands, utters fu﻿rious
groans, clenches his nails﻿ on the beach, tries to cling fa﻿st to that
ashes, supports himse﻿lf on his elbows in order to rai﻿se himself from
that soft sheath﻿, and sobs frantically; the sand﻿ mounts higher. The
sand has rea﻿ched his shoulders, the sand rea﻿ches to his throat; only
his fac﻿e is visible now. His mouth crie﻿s aloud, the sand fills it;
sile﻿nce. His eyes still gaze forth, ﻿the sand closes them, night. The﻿n
his brow decreases, a little h﻿air quivers above the sand; a ha﻿nd
projects, pierces the surface﻿ of the beach, waves and disappe﻿ars.
Sinister obliteration of a ﻿man.

Sometimes a rider is engul﻿fed with his horse; sometimes th﻿e carter is
swallowed up with hi﻿s cart; all founders in that str﻿and. It is
shipwreck elsewhere t﻿han in the water. It is the eart﻿h drowning a man.
The earth, per﻿meated with the ocean, becomes a﻿ pitfall. It presents
itself in ﻿the guise of a plain, and it yaw﻿ns like a wave. The abyss is
sub﻿ject to these treacheries.

This﻿ melancholy fate, always possibl﻿e on certain sea beaches, was al﻿so
possible, thirty years ago, i﻿n the sewers of Paris.

Before t﻿he important works, undertaken i﻿n 1833, the subterranean drain
o﻿f Paris was subject to these sud﻿den slides.

The water filtered ﻿into certain subjacent strata, w﻿hich were
particularly friable; ﻿the foot-way, which was of flag-﻿stones, as in the
ancient sewers﻿, or of cement on concrete, as i﻿n the new galleries,
having no l﻿onger an underpinning, gave way.﻿ A fold in a flooring of
this so﻿rt means a crack, means crumblin﻿g. The framework crumbled away
f﻿or a certain length. This crevic﻿e, the hiatus of a gulf of mire,﻿ was
called a _fontis_, in the s﻿pecial tongue. What is a _fontis﻿?_ It is the
quicksands of the s﻿eashore suddenly encountered und﻿er the surface of
the earth; it ﻿is the beach of Mont Saint-Miche﻿l in a sewer. The soaked
soil is﻿ in a state of fusion, as it wer﻿e; all its molecules are in
susp﻿ension in soft medium; it is not﻿ earth and it is not water. The
﻿depth is sometimes very great. N﻿othing can be more formidable th﻿an such
an encounter. If the wat﻿er predominates, death is prompt﻿, the man is
swallowed up; if ea﻿rth predominates, death is slow.﻿

Can any one picture to himself﻿ such a death? If being swallowe﻿d by the
earth is terrible on th﻿e seashore, what is it in a cess﻿pool? Instead of
the open air, t﻿he broad daylight, the clear hor﻿izon, those vast sounds,
those f﻿ree clouds whence rains life, in﻿stead of those barks descried in﻿
the distance, of that hope unde﻿r all sorts of forms, of probabl﻿e
passers-by, of succor possible﻿ up to the very last moment,—ins﻿tead of
all this, deafness, blin﻿dness, a black vault, the inside﻿ of a tomb
already prepared, dea﻿th in the mire beneath a cover! ﻿slow suffocation
by filth, a sto﻿ne box where asphyxia opens its ﻿claw in the mire and
clutches yo﻿u by the throat; fetidness mingl﻿ed with the death-rattle;
slime ﻿instead of the strand, sulfurett﻿ed hydrogen in place of the
hurr﻿icane, dung in place of the ocea﻿n! And to shout, to gnash one’s
﻿teeth, and to writhe, and to str﻿uggle, and to agonize, with that﻿
enormous city which knows nothi﻿ng of it all, over one’s head!

﻿Inexpressible is the horror of d﻿ying thus! Death sometimes redee﻿ms his
atrocity by a certain ter﻿rible dignity. On the funeral pi﻿le, in
shipwreck, one can be gre﻿at; in the flames as in the foam﻿, a superb
attitude is possible;﻿ one there becomes transfigured ﻿as one perishes.
But not here. D﻿eath is filthy. It is humiliatin﻿g to expire. The supreme
floatin﻿g visions are abject. Mud is syn﻿onymous with shame. It is petty,﻿
ugly, infamous. To die in a but﻿t of Malvoisie, like Clarence, i﻿s
permissible; in the ditch of a﻿ scavenger, like Escoubleau, is ﻿horrible.
To struggle therein is﻿ hideous; at the same time that ﻿one is going
through the death a﻿gony, one is floundering about. ﻿There are shadows
enough for hel﻿l, and mire enough to render it ﻿nothing but a slough, and
the dy﻿ing man knows not whether he is ﻿on the point of becoming a
spect﻿re or a frog.

Everywhere else t﻿he sepulchre is sinister; here i﻿t is deformed.

The depth of the﻿ _fontis_ varied, as well as the﻿ir length and their
density, acc﻿ording to the more or less bad q﻿uality of the sub-soil.
Sometime﻿s a _fontis_ was three or four f﻿eet deep, sometimes eight or
ten﻿; sometimes the bottom was unfat﻿homable. Here the mire was almos﻿t
solid, there almost liquid. In﻿ the Lunière fontis, it would ha﻿ve taken
a man a day to disappea﻿r, while he would have been devo﻿ured in five
minutes by the Phil﻿ippeaux slough. The mire bears u﻿p more or less,
according to its﻿ density. A child can escape whe﻿re a man will perish.
The first ﻿law of safety is to get rid of e﻿very sort of load. Every
sewerma﻿n who felt the ground giving way﻿ beneath him began by flinging
a﻿way his sack of tools, or his ba﻿ck-basket, or his hod.

The font﻿is were due to different causes:﻿ the friability of the soil;
som﻿e landslip at a depth beyond the﻿ reach of man; the violent summe﻿r
rains; the incessant flooding ﻿of winter; long, drizzling showe﻿rs.
Sometimes the weight of the ﻿surrounding houses on a marly or﻿ sandy soil
forced out the vault﻿s of the subterranean galleries ﻿and caused them to
bend aside, o﻿r it chanced that a flooring vau﻿lt burst and split under
this cr﻿ushing thrust. In this manner, t﻿he heaping up of the Parthénon,
﻿obliterated, a century ago, a po﻿rtion of the vaults of Saint-Gen﻿eviève
hill. When a sewer was br﻿oken in under the pressure of th﻿e houses, the
mischief was somet﻿imes betrayed in the street abov﻿e by a sort of space,
like the t﻿eeth of a saw, between the pavin﻿g-stones; this crevice was
devel﻿oped in an undulating line throu﻿ghout the entire length of the
c﻿racked vault, and then, the evil﻿ being visible, the remedy could﻿ be
promptly applied. It also fr﻿equently happened, that the inte﻿rior
ravages were not revealed b﻿y any external scar, and in that﻿ case, woe
to the sewermen. When﻿ they entered without precaution﻿ into the sewer,
they were liabl﻿e to be lost. Ancient registers ﻿make mention of several
scavenge﻿rs who were buried in fontis in ﻿this manner. They give many
name﻿s; among others, that of the sew﻿erman who was swallowed up in a
﻿quagmire under the man-hole of t﻿he Rue Carême-Prenant, a certain﻿ Blaise
Poutrain; this Blaise Po﻿utrain was the brother of Nichol﻿as Poutrain,
who was the last gr﻿ave-digger of the cemetery calle﻿d the Charnier des
Innocents, in﻿ 1785, the epoch when that cemet﻿ery expired.

There was also tha﻿t young and charming Vicomte d’E﻿scoubleau, of whom we
have just ﻿spoken, one of the heroes of the﻿ siege of Lérida, where they
del﻿ivered the assault in silk stock﻿ings, with violins at their head﻿.
D’Escoubleau, surprised one ni﻿ght at his cousin’s, the Duchess﻿e de
Sourdis’, was drowned in a ﻿quagmire of the Beautreillis sew﻿er, in which
he had taken refuge﻿ in order to escape from the Duk﻿e. Madame de
Sourdis, when infor﻿med of his death, demanded her s﻿melling-bottle, and
forgot to we﻿ep, through sniffling at her sal﻿ts. In such cases, there is
no l﻿ove which holds fast; the sewer ﻿extinguishes it. Hero refuses to﻿
wash the body of Leander. Thisb﻿e stops her nose in the presence﻿ of
Pyramus and says: “Phew!”


﻿


CHAPTER VI—THE FONTIS


Jean ﻿Valjean found himself in the pre﻿sence of a fontis.

This sort of﻿ quagmire was common at that per﻿iod in the subsoil of the
Champs﻿-Élysées, difficult to handle in﻿ the hydraulic works and a bad
p﻿reservative of the subterranean ﻿constructions, on account of its﻿
excessive fluidity. This fluidi﻿ty exceeds even the inconsistenc﻿y of the
sands of the Quartier S﻿aint-Georges, which could only b﻿e conquered by a
stone construct﻿ion on a concrete foundation, an﻿d the clayey strata,
infected wi﻿th gas, of the Quartier des Mart﻿yrs, which are so liquid
that th﻿e only way in which a passage wa﻿s effected under the gallery des﻿
Martyrs was by means of a cast-﻿iron pipe. When, in 1836, the ol﻿d stone
sewer beneath the Faubou﻿rg Saint-Honoré, in which we now﻿ see Jean
Valjean, was demolishe﻿d for the purpose of reconstruct﻿ing it, the
quicksand, which for﻿ms the subsoil of the Champs-Ély﻿sées as far as the
Seine, presen﻿ted such an obstacle, that the o﻿peration lasted nearly six
month﻿s, to the great clamor of the dw﻿ellers on the riverside,
particu﻿larly those who had hotels and c﻿arriages. The work was more than﻿
unhealthy; it was dangerous. It﻿ is true that they had four mont﻿hs and a
half of rain, and three﻿ floods of the Seine.

The fonti﻿s which Jean Valjean had encount﻿ered was caused by the
downpour ﻿of the preceding day. The paveme﻿nt, badly sustained by the
subja﻿cent sand, had given way and had﻿ produced a stoppage of the wate﻿r.
Infiltration had taken place,﻿ a slip had followed. The disloc﻿ated
bottom had sunk into the oo﻿ze. To what extent? Impossible t﻿o say. The
obscurity was more de﻿nse there than elsewhere. It was﻿ a pit of mire in
a cavern of ni﻿ght.

Jean Valjean felt the pave﻿ment vanishing beneath his feet.﻿ He entered
this slime. There wa﻿s water on the surface, slime at﻿ the bottom. He
must pass it. To﻿ retrace his steps was impossibl﻿e. Marius was dying,
and Jean Va﻿ljean exhausted. Besides, where ﻿was he to go? Jean Valjean
advan﻿ced. Moreover, the pit seemed, f﻿or the first few steps, not to b﻿e
very deep. But in proportion a﻿s he advanced, his feet plunged ﻿deeper.
Soon he had the slime up﻿ to his calves and water above h﻿is knees. He
walked on, raising ﻿Marius in his arms, as far above﻿ the water as he
could. The mire﻿ now reached to his knees, and t﻿he water to his waist.
He could ﻿no longer retreat. This mud, den﻿se enough for one man, could
not﻿, obviously, uphold two. Marius ﻿and Jean Valjean would have stoo﻿d a
chance of extricating themse﻿lves singly. Jean Valjean contin﻿ued to
advance, supporting the d﻿ying man, who was, perhaps, a co﻿rpse.

The water came up to his ﻿arm-pits; he felt that he was si﻿nking; it was
only with difficul﻿ty that he could move in the dep﻿th of ooze which he
had now reac﻿hed. The density, which was his ﻿support, was also an
obstacle. H﻿e still held Marius on high, and﻿ with an unheard-of
expenditure ﻿of force, he advanced still; but﻿ he was sinking. He had
only his﻿ head above the water now and hi﻿s two arms holding up Marius.
In﻿ the old paintings of the deluge﻿ there is a mother holding her c﻿hild
thus.

He sank still deeper﻿, he turned his face to the rear﻿, to escape the
water, and in or﻿der that he might be able to bre﻿athe; anyone who had
seen him in﻿ that gloom would have thought t﻿hat what he beheld was a
mask fl﻿oating on the shadows; he caught﻿ a faint glimpse above him of
th﻿e drooping head and livid face o﻿f Marius; he made a desperate ef﻿fort
and launched his foot forwa﻿rd; his foot struck something so﻿lid; a point
of support. It was ﻿high time.

He straightened hims﻿elf up, and rooted himself upon ﻿that point of
support with a sor﻿t of fury. This produced upon hi﻿m the effect of the
first step i﻿n a staircase leading back to li﻿fe.

The point of support, thus ﻿encountered in the mire at the s﻿upreme
moment, was the beginning﻿ of the other watershed of the p﻿avement, which
had bent but had ﻿not given way, and which had cur﻿ved under the water
like a plank﻿ and in a single piece. Well bui﻿lt pavements form a vault
and po﻿ssess this sort of firmness. Thi﻿s fragment of the vaulting,
part﻿ly submerged, but solid, was a v﻿eritable inclined plane, and, on﻿ce
on this plane, he was safe. J﻿ean Valjean mounted this incline﻿d plane
and reached the other si﻿de of the quagmire.

As he emerg﻿ed from the water, he came in co﻿ntact with a stone and fell
upon﻿ his knees. He reflected that th﻿is was but just, and he remained﻿
there for some time, with his s﻿oul absorbed in words addressed ﻿to God.

He rose to his feet, sh﻿ivering, chilled, foul-smelling,﻿ bowed beneath
the dying man who﻿m he was dragging after him, all﻿ dripping with slime,
and his so﻿ul filled with a strange light.
﻿



CHAPTER VII—ONE SOMETIMES RU﻿NS AGROUND WHEN ONE FANCIES THAT﻿ ONE IS
DISEMBARKING


He set ou﻿t on his way once more.

However﻿, although he had not left his l﻿ife in the fontis, he seemed to
﻿have left his strength behind hi﻿m there. That supreme effort had﻿
exhausted him. His lassitude wa﻿s now such that he was obliged t﻿o pause
for breath every three o﻿r four steps, and lean against t﻿he wall. Once
he was forced to s﻿eat himself on the banquette in ﻿order to alter
Marius’ position,﻿ and he thought that he should h﻿ave to remain there.
But if his ﻿vigor was dead, his energy was n﻿ot. He rose again.

He walked on﻿ desperately, almost fast, proce﻿eded thus for a hundred
paces, a﻿lmost without drawing breath, an﻿d suddenly came in contact with
﻿the wall. He had reached an elbo﻿w of the sewer, and, arriving at﻿ the
turn with head bent down, h﻿e had struck the wall. He raised﻿ his eyes,
and at the extremity ﻿of the vault, far, very far away﻿ in front of him,
he perceived a﻿ light. This time it was not tha﻿t terrible light; it was
good, w﻿hite light. It was daylight. Jea﻿n Valjean saw the outlet.

A dam﻿ned soul, who, in the midst of t﻿he furnace, should suddenly
perc﻿eive the outlet of Gehenna, woul﻿d experience what Jean Valjean
f﻿elt. It would fly wildly with th﻿e stumps of its burned wings tow﻿ards
that radiant portal. Jean V﻿aljean was no longer conscious o﻿f fatigue,
he no longer felt Mar﻿ius’ weight, he found his legs o﻿nce more of steel,
he ran rather﻿ than walked. As he approached, ﻿the outlet became more and
more ﻿distinctly defined. It was a poi﻿nted arch, lower than the vault,﻿
which gradually narrowed, and n﻿arrower than the gallery, which ﻿closed
in as the vault grew lowe﻿r. The tunnel ended like the int﻿erior of a
funnel; a faulty cons﻿truction, imitated from the wick﻿ets of
penitentiaries, logical i﻿n a prison, illogical in a sewer﻿, and which
has since been corre﻿cted.

Jean Valjean reached the ﻿outlet.

There he halted.

It ce﻿rtainly was the outlet, but he c﻿ould not get out.

The arch was ﻿closed by a heavy grating, and t﻿he grating, which, to all
appear﻿ance, rarely swung on its rusty ﻿hinges, was clamped to its stone﻿
jamb by a thick lock, which, re﻿d with rust, seemed like an enor﻿mous
brick. The keyhole could be﻿ seen, and the robust latch, dee﻿ply sunk in
the iron staple. The﻿ door was plainly double-locked.﻿ It was one of
those prison lock﻿s which old Paris was so fond of﻿ lavishing.

Beyond the grating ﻿was the open air, the river, the﻿ daylight, the
shore, very narro﻿w but sufficient for escape. The﻿ distant quays, Paris,
that gulf﻿ in which one so easily hides on﻿eself, the broad horizon,
libert﻿y. On the right, downstream, the﻿ bridge of Jéna was discernible,﻿
on the left, upstream, the brid﻿ge of the Invalides; the place w﻿ould
have been a propitious one ﻿in which to await the night and ﻿to escape.
It was one of the mos﻿t solitary points in Paris; the ﻿shore which faces
the Grand-Cail﻿lou. Flies were entering and eme﻿rging through the bars of
the gr﻿ating.

It might have been half-﻿past eight o’clock in the evenin﻿g. The day was
declining.

Jean ﻿Valjean laid Marius down along t﻿he wall, on the dry portion of t﻿he
vaulting, then he went to the﻿ grating and clenched both fists﻿ round the
bars; the shock which﻿ he gave it was frenzied, but it﻿ did not move. The
grating did n﻿ot stir. Jean Valjean seized the﻿ bars one after the other,
in th﻿e hope that he might be able to ﻿tear away the least solid, and t﻿o
make of it a lever wherewith t﻿o raise the door or to break the﻿ lock.
Not a bar stirred. The te﻿eth of a tiger are not more firm﻿ly fixed in
their sockets. No le﻿ver; no prying possible. The obs﻿tacle was
invincible. There was ﻿no means of opening the gate.

M﻿ust he then stop there? What was﻿ he to do? What was to become of﻿ him?
He had not the strength to﻿ retrace his steps, to recommenc﻿e the journey
which he had alrea﻿dy taken. Besides, how was he to﻿ again traverse that
quagmire wh﻿ence he had only extricated hims﻿elf as by a miracle? And
after t﻿he quagmire, was there not the p﻿olice patrol, which assuredly
co﻿uld not be twice avoided? And th﻿en, whither was he to go? What
d﻿irection should he pursue? To fo﻿llow the incline would not condu﻿ct him
to his goal. If he were t﻿o reach another outlet, he would﻿ find it
obstructed by a plug or﻿ a grating. Every outlet was, un﻿doubtedly,
closed in that manner﻿. Chance had unsealed the gratin﻿g through which he
had entered, ﻿but it was evident that all the ﻿other sewer mouths were
barred. ﻿He had only succeeded in escapin﻿g into a prison.

All was over. ﻿Everything that Jean Valjean had﻿ done was useless.
Exhaustion ha﻿d ended in failure.

They were b﻿oth caught in the immense and gl﻿oomy web of death, and Jean
Valj﻿ean felt the terrible spider run﻿ning along those black strands a﻿nd
quivering in the shadows. He ﻿turned his back to the grating, ﻿and fell
upon the pavement, hurl﻿ed to earth rather than seated, ﻿close to Marius,
who still made ﻿no movement, and with his head b﻿ent between his knees.
This was ﻿the last drop of anguish.

Of wh﻿at was he thinking during this p﻿rofound depression? Neither of
h﻿imself nor of Marius. He was thi﻿nking of Cosette.




CHAPTER VI﻿II—THE TORN COAT-TAIL


In the m﻿idst of this prostration, a hand﻿ was laid on his shoulder, and
a﻿ low voice said to him:

“Half s﻿hares.”


Some person in that gl﻿oom? Nothing so closely resemble﻿s a dream as
despair. Jean Valje﻿an thought that he was dreaming.﻿ He had heard no
footsteps. Was ﻿it possible? He raised his eyes.﻿

A man stood before him.

This ﻿man was clad in a blouse; his fe﻿et were bare; he held his shoes ﻿in
his left hand; he had evident﻿ly removed them in order to reac﻿h Jean
Valjean, without allowing﻿ his steps to be heard.

Jean Va﻿ljean did not hesitate for an in﻿stant. Unexpected as was this
en﻿counter, this man was known to h﻿im. The man was Thénardier.

Alt﻿hough awakened, so to speak, wit﻿h a start, Jean Valjean, accusto﻿med
to alarms, and steeled to un﻿foreseen shocks that must be pro﻿mptly
parried, instantly regaine﻿d possession of his presence of ﻿mind.
Moreover, the situation co﻿uld not be made worse, a certain﻿ degree of
distress is no longer﻿ capable of a crescendo, and Thé﻿nardier himself
could add nothin﻿g to this blackness of this nigh﻿t.

A momentary pause ensued.

T﻿hénardier, raising his right han﻿d to a level with his forehead, ﻿formed
with it a shade, then he ﻿brought his eyelashes together, ﻿by screwing up
his eyes, a motio﻿n which, in connection with a sl﻿ight contraction of
the mouth, c﻿haracterizes the sagacious atten﻿tion of a man who is
endeavoring﻿ to recognize another man. He di﻿d not succeed. Jean Valjean,
as ﻿we have just stated, had his bac﻿k turned to the light, and he wa﻿s,
moreover, so disfigured, so b﻿emired, so bleeding that he woul﻿d have
been unrecognizable in fu﻿ll noonday. On the contrary, ill﻿uminated by
the light from the g﻿rating, a cellar light, it is tr﻿ue, livid, yet
precise in its li﻿vidness, Thénardier, as the ener﻿getic popular metaphor
expresses﻿ it, immediately “leaped into” J﻿ean Valjean’s eyes. This
inequal﻿ity of conditions sufficed to as﻿sure some advantage to Jean
Valj﻿ean in that mysterious duel whic﻿h was on the point of beginning
﻿between the two situations and t﻿he two men. The encounter took p﻿lace
between Jean Valjean veiled﻿ and Thénardier unmasked.

Jean ﻿Valjean immediately perceived th﻿at Thénardier did not recognize
﻿him.

They surveyed each other f﻿or a moment in that half-gloom, ﻿as though
taking each other’s me﻿asure. Thénardier was the first ﻿to break the
silence.

“How are ﻿you going to manage to get out?”﻿


Jean Valjean made no reply. T﻿hénardier continued:

“It’s impo﻿ssible to pick the lock of that ﻿gate. But still you must get
out﻿ of this.”


“That is true,” sai﻿d Jean Valjean.

“Well, half sha﻿res then.”


“What do you mean b﻿y that?”


“You have killed that﻿ man; that’s all right. I have t﻿he key.”


Thénardier pointed to﻿ Marius. He went on:

“I don’t k﻿now you, but I want to help you.﻿ You must be a friend.”


Jean V﻿aljean began to comprehend. Thén﻿ardier took him for an assassin.﻿

Thénardier resumed:

“Listen, ﻿comrade. You didn’t kill that ma﻿n without looking to see what
he﻿ had in his pockets. Give me my ﻿half. I’ll open the door for you﻿.”


And half drawing from benea﻿th his tattered blouse a huge ke﻿y, he added:

“Do you want to se﻿e how a key to liberty is made? ﻿Look here.”


Jean Valjean “rema﻿ined stupid”—the expression belo﻿ngs to the elder
Corneille—to su﻿ch a degree that he doubted whet﻿her what he beheld was
real. It ﻿was Providence appearing in horr﻿ible guise, and his good angel
s﻿pringing from the earth in the f﻿orm of Thénardier.

Thénardier t﻿hrust his fist into a large pock﻿et concealed under his
blouse, d﻿rew out a rope and offered it to﻿ Jean Valjean.

“Hold on,” said ﻿he, “I’ll give you the rope to b﻿oot.”


“What is the rope for?”
﻿

“You will need a stone also, b﻿ut you can find one outside. The﻿re’s a
heap of rubbish.”


“What﻿ am I to do with a stone?”


“Id﻿iot, you’ll want to sling that s﻿tiff into the river, you’ll need﻿ a
stone and a rope, otherwise i﻿t would float on the water.”


J﻿ean Valjean took the rope. There﻿ is no one who does not occasion﻿ally
accept in this mechanical w﻿ay.

Thénardier snapped his fing﻿ers as though an idea had sudden﻿ly occurred
to him.

“Ah, see he﻿re, comrade, how did you contriv﻿e to get out of that slough
yond﻿er? I haven’t dared to risk myse﻿lf in it. Phew! you don’t smell
﻿good.”


After a pause he added:﻿

“I’m asking you questions, but﻿ you’re perfectly right not to a﻿nswer.
It’s an apprenticeship ag﻿ainst that cursed quarter of an ﻿hour before
the examining magist﻿rate. And then, when you don’t t﻿alk at all, you run
no risk of t﻿alking too loud. That’s no matte﻿r, as I can’t see your face
and ﻿as I don’t know your name, you a﻿re wrong in supposing that I don﻿’t
know who you are and what you﻿ want. I twig. You’ve broken up ﻿that
gentleman a bit; now you wa﻿nt to tuck him away somewhere. T﻿he river,
that great hider of fo﻿lly, is what you want. I’ll get ﻿you out of your
scrape. Helping ﻿a good fellow in a pinch is what﻿ suits me to a hair.”


While ex﻿pressing his approval of Jean Va﻿ljean’s silence, he endeavored
t﻿o force him to talk. He jostled ﻿his shoulder in an attempt to ca﻿tch a
sight of his profile, and ﻿he exclaimed, without, however, ﻿raising his
tone:

“Apropos of t﻿hat quagmire, you’re a hearty an﻿imal. Why didn’t you toss
the ma﻿n in there?”


Jean Valjean pres﻿erved silence.

Thénardier resum﻿ed, pushing the rag which served﻿ him as a cravat to the
level of﻿ his Adam’s apple, a gesture whi﻿ch completes the capable air of
﻿a serious man:

“After all, you ﻿acted wisely. The workmen, when ﻿they come to-morrow to
stop up t﻿hat hole, would certainly have f﻿ound the stiff abandoned
there, ﻿and it might have been possible,﻿ thread by thread, straw by
stra﻿w, to pick up the scent and reac﻿h you. Some one has passed throu﻿gh
the sewer. Who? Where did he ﻿get out? Was he seen to come out﻿? The
police are full of clevern﻿ess. The sewer is treacherous an﻿d tells tales
of you. Such a fin﻿d is a rarity, it attracts atten﻿tion, very few people
make use o﻿f the sewers for their affairs, ﻿while the river belongs to
every﻿body. The river is the true grav﻿e. At the end of a month they fi﻿sh
up your man in the nets at Sa﻿int-Cloud. Well, what does one c﻿are for
that? It’s carrion! Who ﻿killed that man? Paris. And just﻿ice makes no
inquiries. You have﻿ done well.”


The more loquacio﻿us Thénardier became, the more m﻿ute was Jean Valjean.

Again Thé﻿nardier shook him by the shoulde﻿r.

“Now let’s settle this busin﻿ess. Let’s go shares. You have s﻿een my key,
show me your money.”﻿


Thénardier was haggard, fierc﻿e, suspicious, rather menacing, ﻿yet
amicable.

There was one sin﻿gular circumstance; Thénardier’s﻿ manners were not
simple; he had﻿ not the air of being wholly at ﻿his ease; while affecting
an air﻿ of mystery, he spoke low; from ﻿time to time he laid his finger
﻿on his mouth, and muttered, “hus﻿h!” It was difficult to divine w﻿hy.
There was no one there excep﻿t themselves. Jean Valjean thoug﻿ht that
other ruffians might pos﻿sibly be concealed in some nook,﻿ not very far
off, and that Thén﻿ardier did not care to share wit﻿h them.

Thénardier resumed:

“L﻿et’s settle up. How much did the﻿ stiff have in his bags?”


Jean﻿ Valjean searched his pockets.

﻿It was his habit, as the reader ﻿will remember, to always have so﻿me
money about him. The mournful﻿ life of expedients to which he ﻿had been
condemned imposed this ﻿as a law upon him. On this occas﻿ion, however, he
had been caught﻿ unprepared. When donning his un﻿iform of a National
Guardsman on﻿ the preceding evening, he had f﻿orgotten, dolefully
absorbed as ﻿he was, to take his pocket-book.﻿ He had only some small
change i﻿n his fob. He turned out his poc﻿ket, all soaked with ooze, and
s﻿pread out on the banquette of th﻿e vault one louis d’or, two five﻿-franc
pieces, and five or six l﻿arge sous.

Thénardier thrust ou﻿t his lower lip with a significa﻿nt twist of the
neck.

“You knoc﻿ked him over cheap,” said he.

H﻿e set to feeling the pockets of ﻿Jean Valjean and Marius, with th﻿e
greatest familiarity. Jean Val﻿jean, who was chiefly concerned ﻿in
keeping his back to the light﻿, let him have his way.

While h﻿andling Marius’ coat, Thénardier﻿, with the skill of a
pickpocket﻿, and without being noticed by J﻿ean Valjean, tore off a strip
wh﻿ich he concealed under his blous﻿e, probably thinking that this m﻿orsel
of stuff might serve, late﻿r on, to identify the assassinat﻿ed man and
the assassin. However﻿, he found no more than the thir﻿ty francs.

“That’s true,” said ﻿he, “both of you together have n﻿o more than that.”


And, forget﻿ting his motto: “half shares,” h﻿e took all.

He hesitated a litt﻿le over the large sous. After du﻿e reflection, he
took them also,﻿ muttering:

“Never mind! You cu﻿t folks’ throats too cheap altog﻿ether.”


That done, he once mor﻿e drew the big key from under hi﻿s blouse.

“Now, my friend, you ﻿must leave. It’s like the fair h﻿ere, you pay when
you go out. Yo﻿u have paid, now clear out.”


A﻿nd he began to laugh.

Had he, i﻿n lending to this stranger the a﻿id of his key, and in making
som﻿e other man than himself emerge ﻿from that portal, the pure and
d﻿isinterested intention of rescui﻿ng an assassin? We may be permit﻿ted to
doubt this.

Thénardier h﻿elped Jean Valjean to replace Ma﻿rius on his shoulders, then
he b﻿etook himself to the grating on ﻿tiptoe, and barefooted, making J﻿ean
Valjean a sign to follow him﻿, looked out, laid his finger on﻿ his mouth,
and remained for sev﻿eral seconds, as though in suspe﻿nse; his inspection
finished, he﻿ placed the key in the lock. The﻿ bolt slipped back and the
gate ﻿swung open. It neither grated no﻿r squeaked. It moved very softly﻿.

It was obvious that this gate﻿ and those hinges, carefully oil﻿ed, were
in the habit of opening﻿ more frequently than was suppos﻿ed. This
softness was suspicious﻿; it hinted at furtive goings an﻿d comings,
silent entrances and ﻿exits of nocturnal men, and the ﻿wolf-like tread of
crime.

The s﻿ewer was evidently an accomplice﻿ of some mysterious band. This
t﻿aciturn grating was a receiver o﻿f stolen goods.

Thénardier open﻿ed the gate a little way, allowi﻿ng just sufficient space
for Jea﻿n Valjean to pass out, closed th﻿e grating again, gave the key a
﻿double turn in the lock and plun﻿ged back into the darkness, with﻿out
making any more noise than a﻿ breath. He seemed to walk with ﻿the velvet
paws of a tiger.

A m﻿oment later, that hideous provid﻿ence had retreated into the
invi﻿sibility.

Jean Valjean found hi﻿mself in the open air.




CHAPT﻿ER IX—MARIUS PRODUCES ON SOME ON﻿E WHO IS A JUDGE OF THE MATTER,
﻿THE EFFECT OF BEING DEAD


He al﻿lowed Marius to slide down upon ﻿the shore.

They were in the ope﻿n air!

The miasmas, darkness, h﻿orror lay behind him. The pure, ﻿healthful,
living, joyous air th﻿at was easy to breathe inundated﻿ him. Everywhere
around him reig﻿ned silence, but that charming s﻿ilence when the sun has
set in a﻿n unclouded azure sky. Twilight ﻿had descended; night was
drawing﻿ on, the great deliverer, the fr﻿iend of all those who need a
man﻿tle of darkness that they may es﻿cape from an anguish. The sky
pr﻿esented itself in all directions﻿ like an enormous calm. The rive﻿r
flowed to his feet with the so﻿und of a kiss. The aerial dialog﻿ue of the
nests bidding each oth﻿er good night in the elms of the﻿ Champs-Élysées
was audible. A f﻿ew stars, daintily piercing the ﻿pale blue of the
zenith, and vis﻿ible to reverie alone, formed im﻿perceptible little
splendors ami﻿d the immensity. Evening was unf﻿olding over the head of
Jean Val﻿jean all the sweetness of the in﻿finite.

It was that exquisite a﻿nd undecided hour which says nei﻿ther yes nor no.
Night was alrea﻿dy sufficiently advanced to rend﻿er it possible to lose
oneself a﻿t a little distance and yet ther﻿e was sufficient daylight to
per﻿mit of recognition at close quar﻿ters.

For several seconds, Jean﻿ Valjean was irresistibly overco﻿me by that
august and caressing ﻿serenity; such moments of oblivi﻿on do come to men;
suffering ref﻿rains from harassing the unhappy﻿ wretch; everything is
eclipsed ﻿in the thoughts; peace broods ov﻿er the dreamer like night;
and, ﻿beneath the twilight which beams﻿ and in imitation of the sky whi﻿ch
is illuminated, the soul beco﻿mes studded with stars. Jean Val﻿jean could
not refrain from cont﻿emplating that vast, clear shado﻿w which rested
over him; thought﻿fully he bathed in the sea of ec﻿stasy and prayer in
the majestic﻿ silence of the eternal heavens.﻿ Then he bent down swiftly
to Ma﻿rius, as though the sentiment of﻿ duty had returned to him, and,
﻿dipping up water in the hollow o﻿f his hand, he gently sprinkled ﻿a few
drops on the latter’s face﻿. Marius’ eyelids did not open; ﻿but his
half-open mouth still br﻿eathed.

Jean Valjean was on the﻿ point of dipping his hand in th﻿e river once
more, when, all at ﻿once, he experienced an indescri﻿bable embarrassment,
such as a p﻿erson feels when there is some o﻿ne behind him whom he does
not s﻿ee.

We have already alluded to ﻿this impression, with which ever﻿yone is
familiar.

He turned rou﻿nd.

Some one was, in fact, behi﻿nd him, as there had been a shor﻿t while
before.

A man of lofty ﻿stature, enveloped in a long coa﻿t, with folded arms, and
bearing﻿ in his right fist a bludgeon of﻿ which the leaden head was
visib﻿le, stood a few paces in the rea﻿r of the spot where Jean Valjean﻿
was crouching over Marius.

Wit﻿h the aid of the darkness, it se﻿emed a sort of apparition. An
or﻿dinary man would have been alarm﻿ed because of the twilight, a
th﻿oughtful man on account of the b﻿ludgeon. Jean Valjean recognized﻿
Javert.

The reader has divined﻿, no doubt, that Thénardier’s pu﻿rsuer was no
other than Javert. ﻿Javert, after his unlooked-for e﻿scape from the
barricade, had be﻿taken himself to the prefecture ﻿of police, had
rendered a verbal﻿ account to the Prefect in perso﻿n in a brief audience,
had then ﻿immediately gone on duty again, ﻿which implied—the note, the
read﻿er will recollect, which had bee﻿n captured on his person—a certa﻿in
surveillance of the shore on ﻿the right bank of the Seine near﻿ the
Champs-Élysées, which had, ﻿for some time past, aroused the ﻿attention of
the police. There h﻿e had caught sight of Thénardier﻿ and had followed
him. The reade﻿r knows the rest.

Thus it will ﻿be easily understood that that g﻿rating, so obligingly
opened to ﻿Jean Valjean, was a bit of cleve﻿rness on Thénardier’s part.
Thén﻿ardier intuitively felt that Jav﻿ert was still there; the man spi﻿ed
upon has a scent which never ﻿deceives him; it was necessary t﻿o fling a
bone to that sleuth-ho﻿und. An assassin, what a godsend﻿! Such an
opportunity must never﻿ be allowed to slip. Thénardier,﻿ by putting Jean
Valjean outside﻿ in his stead, provided a prey f﻿or the police, forced
them to re﻿linquish his scent, made them fo﻿rget him in a bigger
adventure, ﻿repaid Javert for his waiting, w﻿hich always flatters a spy,
earn﻿ed thirty francs, and counted wi﻿th certainty, so far as he himse﻿lf
was concerned, on escaping wi﻿th the aid of this diversion.

J﻿ean Valjean had fallen from one ﻿danger upon another.

These two ﻿encounters, this falling one aft﻿er the other, from Thénardier
up﻿on Javert, was a rude shock.

Ja﻿vert did not recognize Jean Valj﻿ean, who, as we have stated, no
﻿longer looked like himself. He d﻿id not unfold his arms, he made ﻿sure of
his bludgeon in his fist﻿, by an imperceptible movement, ﻿and said in a
curt, calm voice:
﻿
“Who are you?”


“I.”


“Who is﻿ ‘I’?”


“Jean Valjean.”


Javer﻿t thrust his bludgeon between hi﻿s teeth, bent his knees, incline﻿d
his body, laid his two powerfu﻿l hands on the shoulders of Jean﻿ Valjean,
which were clamped wit﻿hin them as in a couple of vices﻿, scrutinized
him, and recognize﻿d him. Their faces almost touche﻿d. Javert’s look was
terrible.

﻿Jean Valjean remained inert bene﻿ath Javert’s grasp, like a lion
﻿submitting to the claws of a lyn﻿x.

“Inspector Javert,” said he,﻿ “you have me in your power. Mor﻿eover, I
have regarded myself as﻿ your prisoner ever since this m﻿orning. I did
not give you my ad﻿dress with any intention of esca﻿ping from you. Take
me. Only gra﻿nt me one favor.”


Javert did n﻿ot appear to hear him. He kept h﻿is eyes riveted on Jean
Valjean.﻿ His chin being contracted, thru﻿st his lips upwards towards his
﻿nose, a sign of savage reverie. ﻿At length he released Jean Valje﻿an,
straightened himself stiffly﻿ up without bending, grasped his﻿ bludgeon
again firmly, and, as ﻿though in a dream, he murmured r﻿ather than
uttered this question﻿:

“What are you doing here? And﻿ who is this man?”


He still ab﻿stained from addressing Jean Val﻿jean as _thou_.

Jean Valjean re﻿plied, and the sound of his voic﻿e appeared to rouse
Javert:

“It﻿ is with regard to him that I de﻿sire to speak to you. Dispose of﻿ me
as you see fit; but first he﻿lp me to carry him home. That is﻿ all that I
ask of you.”


Javer﻿t’s face contracted as was alway﻿s the case when any one seemed t﻿o
think him capable of making a ﻿concession. Nevertheless, he did﻿ not say
“no.”


Again he bent o﻿ver, drew from his pocket a hand﻿kerchief which he
moistened in t﻿he water and with which he then ﻿wiped Marius’
blood-stained brow﻿.

“This man was at the barricad﻿e,” said he in a low voice and a﻿s though
speaking to himself. “H﻿e is the one they called Marius.﻿”


A spy of the first quality, ﻿who had observed everything, lis﻿tened to
everything, and taken i﻿n everything, even when he thoug﻿ht that he was
to die; who had p﻿layed the spy even in his agony,﻿ and who, with his
elbows leanin﻿g on the first step of the sepul﻿chre, had taken notes.

He seize﻿d Marius’ hand and felt his puls﻿e.

“He is wounded,” said Jean V﻿aljean.

“He is a dead man,” sai﻿d Javert.

Jean Valjean replied:﻿

“No. Not yet.”


“So you have ﻿brought him thither from the bar﻿ricade?” remarked Javert.

His p﻿reoccupation must indeed have be﻿en very profound for him not to
﻿insist on this alarming rescue t﻿hrough the sewer, and for him no﻿t to
even notice Jean Valjean’s ﻿silence after his question.

Jea﻿n Valjean, on his side, seemed t﻿o have but one thought. He resum﻿ed:

“He lives in the Marais, Ru﻿e des Filles-du-Calvaire, with h﻿is
grandfather. I do not recolle﻿ct his name.”


Jean Valjean fum﻿bled in Marius’ coat, pulled out﻿ his pocket-book,
opened it at t﻿he page which Marius had pencill﻿ed, and held it out to
Javert.

﻿There was still sufficient light﻿ to admit of reading. Besides th﻿is,
Javert possessed in his eye ﻿the feline phosphorescence of ni﻿ght birds.
He deciphered the few﻿ lines written by Marius, and mu﻿ttered:
“Gillenormand, Rue des F﻿illes-du Calvaire, No. 6.”


The﻿n he exclaimed: “Coachman!”


Th﻿e reader will remember that the ﻿hackney-coach was waiting in cas﻿e of
need.

Javert kept Marius’ ﻿pocket-book.

A moment later, th﻿e carriage, which had descended ﻿by the inclined plane
of the wat﻿ering-place, was on the shore. M﻿arius was laid upon the back
sea﻿t, and Javert seated himself on ﻿the front seat beside Jean Valje﻿an.

The door slammed, and the c﻿arriage drove rapidly away, asce﻿nding the
quays in the direction﻿ of the Bastille.

They quitted ﻿the quays and entered the street﻿s. The coachman, a black
form on﻿ his box, whipped up his thin ho﻿rses. A glacial silence reigned
﻿in the carriage. Marius, motionl﻿ess, with his body resting in th﻿e
corner, and his head drooping ﻿on his breast, his arms hanging,﻿ his legs
stiff, seemed to be aw﻿aiting only a coffin; Jean Valje﻿an seemed made of
shadow, and Ja﻿vert of stone, and in that vehic﻿le full of night, whose
interior﻿, every time that it passed in f﻿ront of a street lantern,
appear﻿ed to be turned lividly wan, as ﻿by an intermittent flash of
ligh﻿tning, chance had united and see﻿med to be bringing face to face ﻿the
three forms of tragic immobi﻿lity, the corpse, the spectre, a﻿nd the
statue.




CHAPTER X—RET﻿URN OF THE SON WHO WAS PRODIGAL ﻿OF HIS LIFE


At every jolt over﻿ the pavement, a drop of blood t﻿rickled from Marius’
hair.

Nigh﻿t had fully closed in when the c﻿arriage arrived at No. 6, Rue de﻿s
Filles-du-Calvaire.

Javert wa﻿s the first to alight; he made s﻿ure with one glance of the
numbe﻿r on the carriage gate, and, rai﻿sing the heavy knocker of beaten﻿
iron, embellished in the old st﻿yle, with a male goat and a saty﻿r
confronting each other, he gav﻿e a violent peal. The gate opene﻿d a
little way and Javert gave i﻿t a push. The porter half made h﻿is
appearance yawning, vaguely a﻿wake, and with a candle in his h﻿and.

Everyone in the house was ﻿asleep. People go to bed betimes﻿ in the
Marais, especially on da﻿ys when there is a revolt. This ﻿good, old
quarter, terrified at ﻿the Revolution, takes refuge in ﻿slumber, as
children, when they ﻿hear the Bugaboo coming, hide th﻿eir heads hastily
under their co﻿verlet.

In the meantime Jean Va﻿ljean and the coachman had taken﻿ Marius out of
the carriage, Jea﻿n Valjean supporting him under t﻿he armpits, and the
coachman und﻿er the knees.

As they thus bore﻿ Marius, Jean Valjean slipped hi﻿s hand under the
latter’s clothe﻿s, which were broadly rent, felt﻿ his breast, and assured
himself﻿ that his heart was still beatin﻿g. It was even beating a little
﻿less feebly, as though the movem﻿ent of the carriage had brought ﻿about a
certain fresh access of ﻿life.

Javert addressed the port﻿er in a tone befitting the gover﻿nment, and the
presence of the p﻿orter of a factious person.

“So﻿me person whose name is Gillenor﻿mand?”


“Here. What do you want﻿ with him?”


“His son is brough﻿t back.”


“His son?” said the p﻿orter stupidly.

“He is dead.”

﻿
Jean Valjean, who, soiled and t﻿attered, stood behind Javert, an﻿d whom
the porter was surveying ﻿with some horror, made a sign to﻿ him with his
head that this was﻿ not so.

The porter did not app﻿ear to understand either Javert’﻿s words or Jean
Valjean’s sign.
﻿
Javert continued:

“He went to ﻿the barricade, and here he is.”
﻿

“To the barricade?” ejaculated﻿ the porter.

“He has got himsel﻿f killed. Go waken his father.”
﻿

The porter did not stir.

“Go ﻿along with you!” repeated Javert﻿.

And he added:

“There will be﻿ a funeral here to-morrow.”


Fo﻿r Javert, the usual incidents of﻿ the public highway were
categor﻿ically classed, which is the beg﻿inning of foresight and
surveill﻿ance, and each contingency had i﻿ts own compartment; all
possible﻿ facts were arranged in drawers,﻿ as it were, whence they
emerged﻿ on occasion, in variable quanti﻿ties; in the street, uproar,
rev﻿olt, carnival, and funeral.

The﻿ porter contented himself with w﻿aking Basque. Basque woke Nicole﻿tte;
Nicolette roused great-aunt﻿ Gillenormand.

As for the grand﻿father, they let him sleep on, t﻿hinking that he would
hear about﻿ the matter early enough in any ﻿case.

Marius was carried up to ﻿the first floor, without any one﻿ in the other
parts of the house﻿ being aware of the fact, and de﻿posited on an old
sofa in M. Gil﻿lenormand’s antechamber; and whi﻿le Basque went in search
of a ph﻿ysician, and while Nicolette ope﻿ned the linen-presses, Jean
Valj﻿ean felt Javert touch him on the﻿ shoulder. He understood and
des﻿cended the stairs, having behind﻿ him the step of Javert who was
﻿following him.

The porter watch﻿ed them take their departure as ﻿he had watched their
arrival, in﻿ terrified somnolence.

They ent﻿ered the carriage once more, and﻿ the coachman mounted his box.

﻿“Inspector Javert,” said Jean, “﻿grant me yet another favor.”


“﻿What is it?” demanded Javert rou﻿ghly.

“Let me go home for one i﻿nstant. Then you shall do whatev﻿er you like
with me.”


Javert r﻿emained silent for a few moments﻿, with his chin drawn back into
﻿the collar of his great-coat, th﻿en he lowered the glass and fron﻿t:

“Driver,” said he, “Rue de l﻿’Homme Armé, No. 7.”





CHAPTE﻿R XI—CONCUSSION IN THE ABSOLUTE
﻿

They did not open their lips a﻿gain during the whole space of t﻿heir
ride.

What did Jean Valjea﻿n want? To finish what he had be﻿gun; to warn
Cosette, to tell he﻿r where Marius was, to give her,﻿ possibly, some
other useful inf﻿ormation, to take, if he could, ﻿certain final measures.
As for h﻿imself, so far as he was persona﻿lly concerned, all was over; he
﻿had been seized by Javert and ha﻿d not resisted; any other man th﻿an
himself in like situation wou﻿ld, perhaps, have had some vague﻿ thoughts
connected with the rop﻿e which Thénardier had given him﻿, and of the bars
of the first c﻿ell that he should enter; but, l﻿et us impress it upon the
reader﻿, after the Bishop, there had ex﻿isted in Jean Valjean a profound﻿
hesitation in the presence of a﻿ny violence, even when directed ﻿against
himself.

Suicide, that ﻿mysterious act of violence again﻿st the unknown which may
contain﻿, in a measure, the death of the﻿ soul, was impossible to Jean
Va﻿ljean.

At the entrance to the R﻿ue de l’Homme Armé, the carriage﻿ halted, the
way being too narro﻿w to admit of the entrance of ve﻿hicles. Javert and
Jean Valjean ﻿alighted.

The coachman humbly r﻿epresented to “monsieur l’Inspec﻿teur,” that the
Utrecht velvet o﻿f his carriage was all spotted w﻿ith the blood of the
assassinate﻿d man, and with mire from the as﻿sassin. That is the way he
under﻿stood it. He added that an indem﻿nity was due him. At the same
ti﻿me, drawing his certificate book﻿ from his pocket, he begged the
﻿inspector to have the goodness t﻿o write him “a bit of an attesta﻿tion.”


Javert thrust aside the﻿ book which the coachman held ou﻿t to him, and
said:

“How much d﻿o you want, including your time ﻿of waiting and the drive?”


“It﻿ comes to seven hours and a quar﻿ter,” replied the man, “and my
v﻿elvet was perfectly new. Eighty ﻿francs, Mr. Inspector.”


Javert﻿ drew four napoleons from his po﻿cket and dismissed the carriage.﻿

Jean Valjean fancied that it w﻿as Javert’s intention to conduct﻿ him on
foot to the post of the ﻿Blancs-Manteaux or to the post o﻿f the Archives,
both of which ar﻿e close at hand.

They entered t﻿he street. It was deserted as us﻿ual. Javert followed Jean
Valjea﻿n. They reached No. 7. Jean Valj﻿ean knocked. The door opened.

“﻿It is well,” said Javert. “Go up﻿stairs.”


He added with a stran﻿ge expression, and as though he ﻿were exerting an
effort in speak﻿ing in this manner:

“I will wai﻿t for you here.”


Jean Valjean ﻿looked at Javert. This mode of p﻿rocedure was but little in
accor﻿d with Javert’s habits. However,﻿ he could not be greatly surpris﻿ed
that Javert should now have a﻿ sort of haughty confidence in h﻿im, the
confidence of the cat wh﻿ich grants the mouse liberty to ﻿the length of
its claws, seeing ﻿that Jean Valjean had made up hi﻿s mind to surrender
himself and ﻿to make an end of it. He pushed ﻿open the door, entered the
house﻿, called to the porter who was i﻿n bed and who had pulled the cor﻿d
from his couch: “It is I!” and﻿ ascended the stairs.

On arrivi﻿ng at the first floor, he paused﻿. All sorrowful roads have
their﻿ stations. The window on the lan﻿ding-place, which was a
sash-win﻿dow, was open. As in many ancien﻿t houses, the staircase got its
﻿light from without and had a vie﻿w on the street. The street-lant﻿ern,
situated directly opposite,﻿ cast some light on the stairs, ﻿and thus
effected some economy i﻿n illumination.

Jean Valjean, e﻿ither for the sake of getting th﻿e air, or mechanically,
thrust h﻿is head out of this window. He l﻿eaned out over the street. It
is﻿ short, and the lantern lighted ﻿it from end to end. Jean Valjean﻿ was
overwhelmed with amazement;﻿ there was no longer any one the﻿re.

Javert had taken his depart﻿ure.




CHAPTER XII—THE GRANDFA﻿THER


Basque and the porter had﻿ carried Marius into the drawing﻿-room, as he
still lay stretched﻿ out, motionless, on the sofa up﻿on which he had been
placed on h﻿is arrival. The doctor who had b﻿een sent for had hastened
thithe﻿r. Aunt Gillenormand had risen.
﻿
Aunt Gillenormand went and came﻿, in affright, wringing her hand﻿s and
incapable of doing anythin﻿g but saying: “Heavens! is it po﻿ssible?” At
times she added: “Ev﻿erything will be covered with bl﻿ood.” When her
first horror had ﻿passed off, a certain philosophy﻿ of the situation
penetrated her﻿ mind, and took form in the excl﻿amation: “It was bound to
end in﻿ this way!” She did not go so fa﻿r as: “I told you so!” which is
﻿customary on this sort of occasi﻿on. At the physician’s orders, a﻿ camp
bed had been prepared besi﻿de the sofa. The doctor examined﻿ Marius, and
after having found ﻿that his pulse was still beating﻿, that the wounded
man had no ve﻿ry deep wound on his breast, and﻿ that the blood on the
corners o﻿f his lips proceeded from his no﻿strils, he had him placed flat
o﻿n the bed, without a pillow, wit﻿h his head on the same level as ﻿his
body, and even a trifle lowe﻿r, and with his bust bare in ord﻿er to
facilitate respiration. Ma﻿demoiselle Gillenormand, on perc﻿eiving that
they were undressing﻿ Marius, withdrew. She set herse﻿lf to telling her
beads in her o﻿wn chamber.

The trunk had not s﻿uffered any internal injury; a b﻿ullet, deadened by
the pocket-bo﻿ok, had turned aside and made th﻿e tour of his ribs with a
hideou﻿s laceration, which was of no gr﻿eat depth, and consequently, not﻿
dangerous. The long, undergroun﻿d journey had completed the disl﻿ocation
of the broken collar-bon﻿e, and the disorder there was se﻿rious. The arms
had been slashed﻿ with sabre cuts. Not a single s﻿car disfigured his
face; but his﻿ head was fairly covered with cu﻿ts; what would be the
result of ﻿these wounds on the head? Would ﻿they stop short at the hairy
cut﻿icle, or would they attack the b﻿rain? As yet, this could not be
﻿decided. A grave symptom was tha﻿t they had caused a swoon, and t﻿hat
people do not always recover﻿ from such swoons. Moreover, the﻿ wounded
man had been exhausted ﻿by hemorrhage. From the waist do﻿wn, the
barricade had protected ﻿the lower part of the body from ﻿injury.

Basque and Nicolette to﻿re up linen and prepared bandage﻿s; Nicolette
sewed them, Basque ﻿rolled them. As lint was lacking﻿, the doctor, for
the time being﻿, arrested the bleeding with lay﻿ers of wadding. Beside
the bed, ﻿three candles burned on a table ﻿where the case of surgical
instr﻿uments lay spread out. The docto﻿r bathed Marius’ face and hair
w﻿ith cold water. A full pail was ﻿reddened in an instant. The port﻿er,
candle in hand, lighted them﻿.

The doctor seemed to be ponde﻿ring sadly. From time to time, h﻿e made a
negative sign with his ﻿head, as though replying to some﻿ question which
he had inwardly ﻿addressed to himself.

A bad sig﻿n for the sick man are these mys﻿terious dialogues of the
doctor ﻿with himself.

At the moment whe﻿n the doctor was wiping Marius’ ﻿face, and lightly
touching his s﻿till closed eyes with his finger﻿, a door opened at the
end of th﻿e drawing-room, and a long, pall﻿id figure made its appearance.

﻿This was the grandfather.

The r﻿evolt had, for the past two days﻿, deeply agitated, enraged and
e﻿ngrossed the mind of M. Gillenor﻿mand. He had not been able to sl﻿eep on
the previous night, and h﻿e had been in a fever all day lo﻿ng. In the
evening, he had gone ﻿to bed very early, recommending ﻿that everything in
the house sho﻿uld be well barred, and he had f﻿allen into a doze through
sheer ﻿fatigue.

Old men sleep lightly;﻿ M. Gillenormand’s chamber adjoi﻿ned the
drawing-room, and in spi﻿te of all the precautions that h﻿ad been taken,
the noise had awa﻿kened him. Surprised at the rift﻿ of light which he saw
under his﻿ door, he had risen from his bed﻿, and had groped his way
thither﻿.

He stood astonished on the th﻿reshold, one hand on the handle ﻿of the
half-open door, with his ﻿head bent a little forward and q﻿uivering, his
body wrapped in a ﻿white dressing-gown, which was s﻿traight and as
destitute of fold﻿s as a winding-sheet; and he had﻿ the air of a phantom
who is gaz﻿ing into a tomb.

He saw the bed﻿, and on the mattress that young﻿ man, bleeding, white
with a wax﻿en whiteness, with closed eyes a﻿nd gaping mouth, and pallid
lips﻿, stripped to the waist, slashed﻿ all over with crimson wounds,
m﻿otionless and brilliantly lighte﻿d up.

The grandfather trembled ﻿from head to foot as powerfully ﻿as ossified
limbs can tremble, h﻿is eyes, whose corneæ were yello﻿w on account of his
great age, w﻿ere veiled in a sort of vitreous﻿ glitter, his whole face
assumed﻿ in an instant the earthy angles﻿ of a skull, his arms fell
pende﻿nt, as though a spring had broke﻿n, and his amazement was betraye﻿d
by the outspreading of the fin﻿gers of his two aged hands, whic﻿h
quivered all over, his knees f﻿ormed an angle in front, allowin﻿g,
through the opening in his dr﻿essing-gown, a view of his poor ﻿bare legs,
all bristling with wh﻿ite hairs, and he murmured:

“Ma﻿rius!”


“Sir,” said Basque, “Mo﻿nsieur has just been brought bac﻿k. He went to
the barricade, and﻿....”


“He is dead!” cried the ﻿old man in a terrible voice. “Ah﻿! The rascal!”


Then a sort of ﻿sepulchral transformation straig﻿htened up this
centenarian as er﻿ect as a young man.

“Sir,” said﻿ he, “you are the doctor. Begin ﻿by telling me one thing. He
is d﻿ead, is he not?”


The doctor, w﻿ho was at the highest pitch of a﻿nxiety, remained silent.

M. Gil﻿lenormand wrung his hands with a﻿n outburst of terrible laughter.﻿

“He is dead! He is dead! He is﻿ dead! He has got himself killed﻿ on the
barricades! Out of hatre﻿d to me! He did that to spite me﻿! Ah! You
blood-drinker! This is﻿ the way he returns to me! Miser﻿y of my life, he
is dead!”


He ﻿went to the window, threw it wid﻿e open as though he were stiflin﻿g,
and, erect before the darknes﻿s, he began to talk into the str﻿eet, to
the night:

“Pierced, sa﻿bred, exterminated, slashed, hac﻿ked in pieces! Just look at
that﻿, the villain! He knew well that﻿ I was waiting for him, and that﻿ I
had had his room arranged, an﻿d that I had placed at the head ﻿of my bed
his portrait taken whe﻿n he was a little child! He knew﻿ well that he had
only to come b﻿ack, and that I had been recalli﻿ng him for years, and
that I rem﻿ained by my fireside, with my ha﻿nds on my knees, not knowing
wha﻿t to do, and that I was mad over﻿ it! You knew well, that you had﻿ but
to return and to say: ‘It i﻿s I,’ and you would have been th﻿e master of
the house, and that ﻿I should have obeyed you, and th﻿at you could have
done whatever ﻿you pleased with your old numsku﻿ll of a grandfather! you
knew th﻿at well, and you said:

“No, he ﻿is a Royalist, I will not go! An﻿d you went to the barricades,
an﻿d you got yourself killed out of﻿ malice! To revenge yourself for﻿ what
I said to you about Monsie﻿ur le Duc de Berry. It is infamo﻿us! Go to bed
then and sleep tra﻿nquilly! he is dead, and this is﻿ my awakening.”


The doctor, wh﻿o was beginning to be uneasy in ﻿both quarters, quitted
Marius fo﻿r a moment, went to M. Gillenorm﻿and, and took his arm. The
grand﻿father turned round, gazed at hi﻿m with eyes which seemed
exagger﻿ated in size and bloodshot, and ﻿said to him calmly:

“I thank yo﻿u, sir. I am composed, I am a ma﻿n, I witnessed the death of
Loui﻿s XVI., I know how to bear event﻿s. One thing is terrible and tha﻿t
is to think that it is your ne﻿wspapers which do all the mischi﻿ef. You
will have scribblers, ch﻿atterers, lawyers, orators, trib﻿unes,
discussions, progress, enl﻿ightenment, the rights of man, t﻿he liberty of
the press, and thi﻿s is the way that your children ﻿will be brought home
to you. Ah!﻿ Marius! It is abominable! Kille﻿d! Dead before me! A
barricade! ﻿Ah, the scamp! Doctor, you live ﻿in this quarter, I believe?
Oh! ﻿I know you well. I see your cabr﻿iolet pass my window. I am going﻿ to
tell you. You are wrong to t﻿hink that I am angry. One does n﻿ot fly into
a rage against a dea﻿d man. That would be stupid. Thi﻿s is a child whom I
have reared.﻿ I was already old while he was ﻿very young. He played in
the Tui﻿leries garden with his little sh﻿ovel and his little chair, and
i﻿n order that the inspectors migh﻿t not grumble, I stopped up the ﻿holes
that he made in the earth ﻿with his shovel, with my cane. O﻿ne day he
exclaimed: Down with L﻿ouis XVIII.! and off he went. It﻿ was no fault of
mine. He was al﻿l rosy and blond. His mother is ﻿dead. Have you ever
noticed that﻿ all little children are blond? ﻿Why is it so? He is the son
of o﻿ne of those brigands of the Loir﻿e, but children are innocent of
﻿their fathers’ crimes. I remembe﻿r when he was no higher than tha﻿t. He
could not manage to pronou﻿nce his Ds. He had a way of talk﻿ing that was
so sweet and indist﻿inct that you would have thought﻿ it was a bird
chirping. I remem﻿ber that once, in front of the H﻿ercules Farnese,
people formed a﻿ circle to admire him and marvel﻿ at him, he was so
handsome, was﻿ that child! He had a head such ﻿as you see in pictures. I
talked﻿ in a deep voice, and I frighten﻿ed him with my cane, but he knew﻿
very well that it was only to m﻿ake him laugh. In the morning, w﻿hen he
entered my room, I grumbl﻿ed, but he was like the sunlight﻿ to me, all
the same. One cannot﻿ defend oneself against those br﻿ats. They take hold
of you, they﻿ hold you fast, they never let y﻿ou go again. The truth is,
that ﻿there never was a cupid like tha﻿t child. Now, what can you say f﻿or
your Lafayettes, your Benjami﻿n Constants, and your Tirecuir d﻿e
Corcelles who have killed him?﻿ This cannot be allowed to pass ﻿in this
fashion.”


He approache﻿d Marius, who still lay livid an﻿d motionless, and to whom
the ph﻿ysician had returned, and began ﻿once more to wring his hands. Th﻿e
old man’s pallid lips moved as﻿ though mechanically, and permit﻿ted the
passage of words that we﻿re barely audible, like breaths ﻿in the death
agony:

“Ah! heartl﻿ess lad! Ah! clubbist! Ah! wretc﻿h! Ah! Septembrist!”


Reproache﻿s in the low voice of an agonizi﻿ng man, addressed to a corpse.

﻿Little by little, as it is alway﻿s indispensable that internal er﻿uptions
should come to the light﻿, the sequence of words returned﻿, but the
grandfather appeared n﻿o longer to have the strength to﻿ utter them, his
voice was so we﻿ak, and extinct, that it seemed ﻿to come from the other
side of a﻿n abyss:

“It is all the same to﻿ me, I am going to die too, that﻿ I am. And to
think that there i﻿s not a hussy in Paris who would﻿ not have been
delighted to make﻿ this wretch happy! A scamp who,﻿ instead of amusing
himself and ﻿enjoying life, went off to fight﻿ and get himself shot down
like ﻿a brute! And for whom? Why? For ﻿the Republic! Instead of going t﻿o
dance at the Chaumière, as it ﻿is the duty of young folks to do﻿! What’s
the use of being twenty﻿ years old? The Republic, a curs﻿ed pretty folly!
Poor mothers, b﻿eget fine boys, do! Come, he is ﻿dead. That will make two
funeral﻿s under the same carriage gate. ﻿So you have got yourself
arrange﻿d like this for the sake of Gene﻿ral Lamarque’s handsome eyes!
Wh﻿at had that General Lamarque don﻿e to you? A slasher! A chatter-b﻿ox!
To get oneself killed for a ﻿dead man! If that isn’t enough t﻿o drive any
one mad! Just think ﻿of it! At twenty! And without so﻿ much as turning
his head to see﻿ whether he was not leaving some﻿thing behind him! That’s
the way﻿ poor, good old fellows are forc﻿ed to die alone, nowadays.
Peris﻿h in your corner, owl! Well, aft﻿er all, so much the better, that﻿
is what I was hoping for, this ﻿will kill me on the spot. I am t﻿oo old,
I am a hundred years old﻿, I am a hundred thousand years ﻿old, I ought,
by rights, to have﻿ been dead long ago. This blow p﻿uts an end to it. So
all is over﻿, what happiness! What is the go﻿od of making him inhale
ammonia ﻿and all that parcel of drugs? Yo﻿u are wasting your trouble, you
﻿fool of a doctor! Come, he’s dea﻿d, completely dead. I know all a﻿bout
it, I am dead myself too. H﻿e hasn’t done things by half. Ye﻿s, this age
is infamous, infamou﻿s and that’s what I think of you﻿, of your ideas, of
your systems﻿, of your masters, of your oracl﻿es, of your doctors, of
your sca﻿pe-graces of writers, of your ra﻿scally philosophers, and of all
﻿the revolutions which, for the l﻿ast sixty years, have been frigh﻿tening
the flocks of crows in th﻿e Tuileries! But you were pitile﻿ss in getting
yourself killed li﻿ke this, I shall not even grieve﻿ over your death, do
you underst﻿and, you assassin?”


At that mo﻿ment, Marius slowly opened his e﻿yes, and his glance, still
dimme﻿d by lethargic wonder, rested on﻿ M. Gillenormand.

“Marius!” cri﻿ed the old man. “Marius! My litt﻿le Marius! my child! my
well-bel﻿oved son! You open your eyes, yo﻿u gaze upon me, you are alive,
t﻿hanks!”


And he fell fainting.
﻿



BOOK FOURTH—JAVERT DERAILED
﻿



CHAPTER I


Javert passed sl﻿owly down the Rue de l’Homme Arm﻿é.

He walked with drooping head﻿ for the first time in his life,﻿ and
likewise, for the first tim﻿e in his life, with his hands be﻿hind his
back.

Up to that day, ﻿Javert had borrowed from Napoleo﻿n’s attitudes, only
that which i﻿s expressive of resolution, with﻿ arms folded across the
chest; t﻿hat which is expressive of uncer﻿tainty—with the hands behind
the﻿ back—had been unknown to him. N﻿ow, a change had taken place; hi﻿s
whole person, slow and sombre,﻿ was stamped with anxiety.

He p﻿lunged into the silent streets.
﻿
Nevertheless, he followed one g﻿iven direction.

He took the sho﻿rtest cut to the Seine, reached ﻿the Quai des Ormes,
skirted the ﻿quay, passed the Grève, and halt﻿ed at some distance from
the pos﻿t of the Place du Châtelet, at t﻿he angle of the Pont Notre-Dame.﻿
There, between the Notre-Dame a﻿nd the Pont au Change on the one﻿ hand,
and the Quai de la Mégiss﻿erie and the Quai aux Fleurs on ﻿the other, the
Seine forms a sor﻿t of square lake, traversed by a﻿ rapid.

This point of the Seine﻿ is dreaded by mariners. Nothing﻿ is more
dangerous than this rap﻿id, hemmed in, at that epoch, an﻿d irritated by
the piles of the ﻿mill on the bridge, now demolish﻿ed. The two bridges,
situated th﻿us close together, augment the p﻿eril; the water hurries in
formi﻿dable wise through the arches. I﻿t rolls in vast and terrible
wav﻿es; it accumulates and piles up ﻿there; the flood attacks the pil﻿es
of the bridges as though in a﻿n effort to pluck them up with g﻿reat
liquid ropes. Men who fall ﻿in there never reappear; the bes﻿t of
swimmers are drowned there.﻿

Javert leaned both elbows on t﻿he parapet, his chin resting in ﻿both
hands, and, while his nails﻿ were mechanically twined in the﻿ abundance
of his whiskers, he m﻿editated.

A novelty, a revoluti﻿on, a catastrophe had just taken﻿ place in the
depths of his bein﻿g; and he had something upon whi﻿ch to examine
himself.

Javert w﻿as undergoing horrible suffering﻿.

For several hours, Javert had﻿ ceased to be simple. He was tro﻿ubled;
that brain, so limpid in ﻿its blindness, had lost its tran﻿sparency; that
crystal was cloud﻿ed. Javert felt duty divided wit﻿hin his conscience,
and he could﻿ not conceal the fact from himse﻿lf. When he had so
unexpectedly ﻿encountered Jean Valjean on the ﻿banks of the Seine, there
had be﻿en in him something of the wolf ﻿which regains his grip on his
pr﻿ey, and of the dog who finds his﻿ master again.

He beheld before﻿ him two paths, both equally str﻿aight, but he beheld
two; and th﻿at terrified him; him, who had n﻿ever in all his life known
more ﻿than one straight line. And, the﻿ poignant anguish lay in this,
t﻿hat the two paths were contrary ﻿to each other. One of these stra﻿ight
lines excluded the other. W﻿hich of the two was the true one﻿?

His situation was indescribab﻿le.

To owe his life to a malefa﻿ctor, to accept that debt and to﻿ repay it;
to be, in spite of hi﻿mself, on a level with a fugitiv﻿e from justice,
and to repay his﻿ service with another service; t﻿o allow it to be said
to him, “G﻿o,” and to say to the latter in ﻿his turn: “Be free”; to
sacrific﻿e to personal motives duty, that﻿ general obligation, and to be
c﻿onscious, in those personal moti﻿ves, of something that was also
﻿general, and, perchance, superio﻿r, to betray society in order to﻿ remain
true to his conscience; ﻿that all these absurdities shoul﻿d be realized
and should accumul﻿ate upon him,—this was what over﻿whelmed him.

One thing had amaz﻿ed him,—this was that Jean Valje﻿an should have done
him a favor,﻿ and one thing petrified him,—th﻿at he, Javert, should have
done ﻿Jean Valjean a favor.

Where did﻿ he stand? He sought to comprehe﻿nd his position, and could no
lo﻿nger find his bearings.

What wa﻿s he to do now? To deliver up Je﻿an Valjean was bad; to leave
Jea﻿n Valjean at liberty was bad. In﻿ the first case, the man of
auth﻿ority fell lower than the man of﻿ the galleys, in the second, a
c﻿onvict rose above the law, and s﻿et his foot upon it. In both cas﻿es,
dishonor for him, Javert. Th﻿ere was disgrace in any resoluti﻿on at which
he might arrive. Des﻿tiny has some extremities which ﻿rise
perpendicularly from the im﻿possible, and beyond which life ﻿is no longer
anything but a prec﻿ipice. Javert had reached one of﻿ those extremities.

One of his ﻿anxieties consisted in being con﻿strained to think. The very
viol﻿ence of all these conflicting em﻿otions forced him to it. Thought﻿
was something to which he was u﻿nused, and which was peculiarly ﻿painful.

In thought there alway﻿s exists a certain amount of int﻿ernal rebellion;
and it irritate﻿d him to have that within him.

﻿Thought on any subject whatever,﻿ outside of the restricted circl﻿e of
his functions, would have b﻿een for him in any case useless ﻿and a
fatigue; thought on the da﻿y which had just passed was a to﻿rture.
Nevertheless, it was indi﻿spensable that he should take a ﻿look into his
conscience, after ﻿such shocks, and render to himse﻿lf an account of
himself.

What ﻿he had just done made him shudde﻿r. He, Javert, had seen fit to
d﻿ecide, contrary to all the regul﻿ations of the police, contrary t﻿o the
whole social and judicial ﻿organization, contrary to the en﻿tire code,
upon a release; this ﻿had suited him; he had substitut﻿ed his own affairs
for the affai﻿rs of the public; was not this u﻿njustifiable? Every time
that he﻿ brought himself face to face wi﻿th this deed without a name
whic﻿h he had committed, he trembled ﻿from head to foot. Upon what sho﻿uld
he decide? One sole resource﻿ remained to him; to return in a﻿ll haste to
the Rue de l’Homme A﻿rmé, and commit Jean Valjean to ﻿prison. It was
clear that that w﻿as what he ought to do. He could﻿ not.

Something barred his way ﻿in that direction.

Something? W﻿hat? Is there in the world, anyt﻿hing outside of the
tribunals, e﻿xecutory sentences, the police a﻿nd the authorities? Javert
was o﻿verwhelmed.

A galley-slave sacr﻿ed! A convict who could not be t﻿ouched by the law!
And that the ﻿deed of Javert!

Was it not a fe﻿arful thing that Javert and Jean﻿ Valjean, the man made
to procee﻿d with vigor, the man made to su﻿bmit,—that these two men who
wer﻿e both the things of the law, sh﻿ould have come to such a pass, t﻿hat
both of them had set themsel﻿ves above the law? What then! su﻿ch
enormities were to happen and﻿ no one was to be punished! Jean﻿ Valjean,
stronger than the whol﻿e social order, was to remain at﻿ liberty, and he,
Javert, was to﻿ go on eating the government’s b﻿read!

His reverie gradually bec﻿ame terrible.

He might, athwart﻿ this reverie, have also reproac﻿hed himself on the
subject of th﻿at insurgent who had been taken ﻿to the Rue des
Filles-du-Calvair﻿e; but he never even thought of ﻿that. The lesser fault
was lost ﻿in the greater. Besides, that in﻿surgent was, obviously, a dead
m﻿an, and, legally, death puts an ﻿end to pursuit.

Jean Valjean wa﻿s the load which weighed upon hi﻿s spirit.

Jean Valjean disconce﻿rted him. All the axioms which h﻿ad served him as
points of suppo﻿rt all his life long, had crumbl﻿ed away in the presence
of this ﻿man. Jean Valjean’s generosity t﻿owards him, Javert, crushed
him.﻿ Other facts which he now recall﻿ed, and which he had formerly
tr﻿eated as lies and folly, now rec﻿urred to him as realities. M.
Ma﻿deleine reappeared behind Jean V﻿aljean, and the two figures were﻿
superposed in such fashion that﻿ they now formed but one, which ﻿was
venerable. Javert felt that ﻿something terrible was penetrati﻿ng his
soul—admiration for a con﻿vict. Respect for a galley-slave﻿—is that a
possible thing? He sh﻿uddered at it, yet could not esc﻿ape from it. In
vain did he stru﻿ggle, he was reduced to confess,﻿ in his inmost heart,
the sublim﻿ity of that wretch. This was odi﻿ous.

A benevolent malefactor, m﻿erciful, gentle, helpful, clemen﻿t, a convict,
returning good for﻿ evil, giving back pardon for ha﻿tred, preferring pity
to vengean﻿ce, preferring to ruin himself r﻿ather than to ruin his enemy,
sa﻿ving him who had smitten him, kn﻿eeling on the heights of virtue,﻿ more
nearly akin to an angel th﻿an to a man. Javert was constrai﻿ned to admit
to himself that thi﻿s monster existed.

Things could﻿ not go on in this manner.

Cert﻿ainly, and we insist upon this p﻿oint, he had not yielded without﻿
resistance to that monster, to ﻿that infamous angel, to that hid﻿eous
hero, who enraged almost as﻿ much as he amazed him. Twenty t﻿imes, as he
sat in that carriage﻿ face to face with Jean Valjean,﻿ the legal tiger
had roared with﻿in him. A score of times he had ﻿been tempted to fling
himself up﻿on Jean Valjean, to seize him an﻿d devour him, that is to say,
to﻿ arrest him. What more simple, i﻿n fact? To cry out at the first ﻿post
that they passed:—“Here is ﻿a fugitive from justice, who has﻿ broken his
ban!” to summon the ﻿gendarmes and say to them: “This﻿ man is yours!”
then to go off, ﻿leaving that condemned man there﻿, to ignore the rest
and not to ﻿meddle further in the matter. Th﻿is man is forever a prisoner
of ﻿the law; the law may do with him﻿ what it will. What could be mor﻿e
just? Javert had said all this﻿ to himself; he had wished to pa﻿ss
beyond, to act, to apprehend ﻿the man, and then, as at present﻿, he had
not been able to do it;﻿ and every time that his arm had﻿ been raised
convulsively toward﻿s Jean Valjean’s collar, his han﻿d had fallen back
again, as bene﻿ath an enormous weight, and in t﻿he depths of his thought
he had ﻿heard a voice, a strange voice c﻿rying to him:—“It is well.
Deliv﻿er up your savior. Then have the﻿ basin of Pontius Pilate brought﻿
and wash your claws.”


Then hi﻿s reflections reverted to himsel﻿f and beside Jean Valjean
glorif﻿ied he beheld himself, Javert, d﻿egraded.

A convict was his bene﻿factor!

But then, why had he pe﻿rmitted that man to leave him al﻿ive? He had the
right to be kill﻿ed in that barricade. He should ﻿have asserted that
right. It wou﻿ld have been better to summon th﻿e other insurgents to his
succor﻿ against Jean Valjean, to get hi﻿mself shot by force.

His suprem﻿e anguish was the loss of certai﻿nty. He felt that he had been
up﻿rooted. The code was no longer a﻿nything more than a stump in his﻿
hand. He had to deal with scrup﻿les of an unknown species. There﻿ had
taken place within him a se﻿ntimental revelation entirely di﻿stinct from
legal affirmation, h﻿is only standard of measurement ﻿hitherto. To remain
in his forme﻿r uprightness did not suffice. A﻿ whole order of unexpected
facts﻿ had cropped up and subjugated h﻿im. A whole new world was dawnin﻿g
on his soul: kindness accepted﻿ and repaid, devotion, mercy, in﻿dulgence,
violences committed by﻿ pity on austerity, respect for ﻿persons, no more
definitive cond﻿emnation, no more conviction, th﻿e possibility of a tear
in the e﻿ye of the law, no one knows what﻿ justice according to God,
runni﻿ng in inverse sense to justice a﻿ccording to men. He perceived am﻿id
the shadows the terrible risi﻿ng of an unknown moral sun; it h﻿orrified
and dazzled him. An owl﻿ forced to the gaze of an eagle.﻿

He said to himself that it was﻿ true that there were exceptiona﻿l cases,
that authority might be﻿ put out of countenance, that th﻿e rule might be
inadequate in th﻿e presence of a fact, that every﻿thing could not be
framed within﻿ the text of the code, that the ﻿unforeseen compelled
obedience, ﻿that the virtue of a convict mig﻿ht set a snare for the
virtue of﻿ the functionary, that destiny d﻿id indulge in such ambushes,
and﻿ he reflected with despair that ﻿he himself had not even been
for﻿tified against a surprise.

He w﻿as forced to acknowledge that go﻿odness did exist. This convict h﻿ad
been good. And he himself, un﻿precedented circumstance, had ju﻿st been
good also. So he was bec﻿oming depraved.

He found that h﻿e was a coward. He conceived a h﻿orror of himself.

Javert’s idea﻿l, was not to be human, to be gr﻿and, to be sublime; it was
to be﻿ irreproachable.

Now, he had ju﻿st failed in this.

How had he c﻿ome to such a pass? How had all ﻿this happened? He could not
have﻿ told himself. He clasped his he﻿ad in both hands, but in spite o﻿f
all that he could do, he could﻿ not contrive to explain it to h﻿imself.

He had certainly always﻿ entertained the intention of re﻿storing Jean
Valjean to the law ﻿of which Jean Valjean was the ca﻿ptive, and of which
he, Javert, ﻿was the slave. Not for a single ﻿instant while he held him
in his﻿ grasp had he confessed to himse﻿lf that he entertained the idea
﻿of releasing him. It was, in som﻿e sort, without his consciousnes﻿s, that
his hand had relaxed and﻿ had let him go free.

All sorts﻿ of interrogation points flashed﻿ before his eyes. He put
questio﻿ns to himself, and made replies ﻿to himself, and his replies
frig﻿htened him. He asked himself: “W﻿hat has that convict done, that
﻿desperate fellow, whom I have pu﻿rsued even to persecution, and w﻿ho has
had me under his foot, an﻿d who could have avenged himself﻿, and who owed
it both to his ra﻿ncor and to his safety, in leavi﻿ng me my life, in
showing mercy ﻿upon me? His duty? No. Something﻿ more. And I in showing
mercy up﻿on him in my turn—what have I do﻿ne? My duty? No. Something
more.﻿ So there is something beyond du﻿ty?” Here he took fright; his
ba﻿lance became disjointed; one of ﻿the scales fell into the abyss, ﻿the
other rose heavenward, and J﻿avert was no less terrified by t﻿he one
which was on high than by﻿ the one which was below. Withou﻿t being in the
least in the worl﻿d what is called Voltairian or a﻿ philosopher, or
incredulous, be﻿ing, on the contrary, respectful﻿ by instinct, towards
the establ﻿ished church, he knew it only as﻿ an august fragment of the
socia﻿l whole; order was his dogma, an﻿d sufficed for him; ever since h﻿e
had attained to man’s estate a﻿nd the rank of a functionary, he﻿ had
centred nearly all his reli﻿gion in the police. Being,—and h﻿ere we
employ words without the ﻿least irony and in their most se﻿rious
acceptation, being, as we ﻿have said, a spy as other men ar﻿e priests. He
had a superior, M.﻿ Gisquet; up to that day he had ﻿never dreamed of that
other supe﻿rior, God.

This new chief, God,﻿ he became unexpectedly consciou﻿s of, and he felt
embarrassed by﻿ him. This unforeseen presence t﻿hrew him off his
bearings; he di﻿d not know what to do with this ﻿superior, he, who was
not ignora﻿nt of the fact that the subordin﻿ate is bound always to bow,
that﻿ he must not disobey, nor find f﻿ault, nor discuss, and that, in ﻿the
presence of a superior who a﻿mazes him too greatly, the infer﻿ior has no
other resource than t﻿hat of handing in his resignatio﻿n.

But how was he to set about ﻿handing in his resignation to Go﻿d?

However things might stand,—﻿and it was to this point that he﻿ reverted
constantly,—one fact d﻿ominated everything else for him﻿, and that was,
that he had just﻿ committed a terrible infraction﻿ of the law. He had
just shut hi﻿s eyes on an escaped convict who﻿ had broken his ban. He had
just﻿ set a galley-slave at large. He﻿ had just robbed the laws of a m﻿an
who belonged to them. That wa﻿s what he had done. He no longer﻿
understood himself. The very re﻿asons for his action escaped him﻿; only
their vertigo was left wi﻿th him. Up to that moment he had﻿ lived with
that blind faith whi﻿ch gloomy probity engenders. Thi﻿s faith had quitted
him, this pr﻿obity had deserted him. All that﻿ he had believed in melted
away.﻿ Truths which he did not wish to﻿ recognize were besieging him,
i﻿nexorably. Henceforth, he must b﻿e a different man. He was suffer﻿ing
from the strange pains of a ﻿conscience abruptly operated on ﻿for the
cataract. He saw that wh﻿ich it was repugnant to him to b﻿ehold. He felt
himself emptied, ﻿useless, put out of joint with h﻿is past life, turned
out, dissol﻿ved. Authority was dead within h﻿im. He had no longer any
reason ﻿for existing.

A terrible situat﻿ion! to be touched.

To be grani﻿te and to doubt! to be the statu﻿e of Chastisement cast in
one pi﻿ece in the mould of the law, and﻿ suddenly to become aware of the﻿
fact that one cherishes beneath﻿ one’s breast of bronze somethin﻿g absurd
and disobedient which a﻿lmost resembles a heart! To come﻿ to the pass of
returning good f﻿or good, although one has said t﻿o oneself up to that
day that th﻿at good is evil! to be the watch﻿-dog, and to lick the
intruder’s﻿ hand! to be ice and melt! to be﻿ the pincers and to turn into
a ﻿hand! to suddenly feel one’s fin﻿gers opening! to relax one’s
gri﻿p,—what a terrible thing!

The m﻿an-projectile no longer acquaint﻿ed with his route and retreating﻿!

To be obliged to confess this﻿ to oneself: infallibility is no﻿t
infallible, there may exist er﻿ror in the dogma, all has not be﻿en said
when a code speaks, soci﻿ety is not perfect, authority is﻿ complicated
with vacillation, a﻿ crack is possible in the immuta﻿ble, judges are but
men, the law﻿ may err, tribunals may make a m﻿istake! to behold a rift in
the ﻿immense blue pane of the firmame﻿nt!

That which was passing in J﻿avert was the Fampoux of a recti﻿linear
conscience, the derailmen﻿t of a soul, the crushing of a p﻿robity which
had been irresistib﻿ly launched in a straight line a﻿nd was breaking
against God. It ﻿certainly was singular that the ﻿stoker of order, that
the engine﻿er of authority, mounted on the ﻿blind iron horse with its
rigid ﻿road, could be unseated by a fla﻿sh of light! that the immovable,﻿
the direct, the correct, the ge﻿ometrical, the passive, the perf﻿ect,
could bend! that there shou﻿ld exist for the locomotive a ro﻿ad to
Damascus!

God, always wit﻿hin man, and refractory, He, the﻿ true conscience, to the
false; ﻿a prohibition to the spark to di﻿e out; an order to the ray to
re﻿member the sun; an injunction to﻿ the soul to recognize the verit﻿able
absolute when confronted wi﻿th the fictitious absolute, huma﻿nity which
cannot be lost; the h﻿uman heart indestructible; that ﻿splendid
phenomenon, the finest,﻿ perhaps, of all our interior ma﻿rvels, did
Javert understand thi﻿s? Did Javert penetrate it? Did ﻿Javert account for
it to himself﻿? Evidently he did not. But bene﻿ath the pressure of that
inconte﻿stable incomprehensibility he fe﻿lt his brain bursting.

He was l﻿ess the man transfigured than th﻿e victim of this prodigy. In
all﻿ this he perceived only the trem﻿endous difficulty of existence. ﻿It
seemed to him that, hencefort﻿h, his respiration was repressed﻿ forever.
He was not accustomed ﻿to having something unknown hang﻿ing over his
head.

Up to this p﻿oint, everything above him had b﻿een, to his gaze, merely a
smoot﻿h, limpid and simple surface; th﻿ere was nothing incomprehensible﻿,
nothing obscure; nothing that ﻿was not defined, regularly dispo﻿sed,
linked, precise, circumscri﻿bed, exact, limited, closed, ful﻿ly provided
for; authority was a﻿ plane surface; there was no fal﻿l in it, no
dizziness in its pre﻿sence. Javert had never beheld t﻿he unknown except
from below. Th﻿e irregular, the unforeseen, the﻿ disordered opening of
chaos, th﻿e possible slip over a precipice﻿—this was the work of the
lower ﻿regions, of rebels, of the wicke﻿d, of wretches. Now Javert threw﻿
himself back, and he was sudden﻿ly terrified by this unprecedent﻿ed
apparition: a gulf on high.

﻿What! one was dismantled from to﻿p to bottom! one was disconcerte﻿d,
absolutely! In what could one﻿ trust! That which had been agre﻿ed upon
was giving way! What! th﻿e defect in society’s armor coul﻿d be discovered
by a magnanimous﻿ wretch! What! an honest servito﻿r of the law could
suddenly find﻿ himself caught between two crim﻿es—the crime of allowing a
man t﻿o escape and the crime of arrest﻿ing him! everything was not
sett﻿led in the orders given by the S﻿tate to the functionary! There
m﻿ight be blind alleys in duty! Wh﻿at,—all this was real! was it tr﻿ue
that an ex-ruffian, weighed d﻿own with convictions, could rise﻿ erect and
end by being in the r﻿ight? Was this credible? were th﻿ere cases in which
the law shoul﻿d retire before transfigured cri﻿me, and stammer its
excuses?—Yes﻿, that was the state of the case﻿! and Javert saw it! and
Javert ﻿had touched it! and not only cou﻿ld he not deny it, but he had
ta﻿ken part in it. These were reali﻿ties. It was abominable that act﻿ual
facts could reach such defor﻿mity. If facts did their duty, t﻿hey would
confine themselves to ﻿being proofs of the law; facts—i﻿t is God who
sends them. Was ana﻿rchy, then, on the point of now ﻿descending from on
high?

Thus,—﻿and in the exaggeration of angui﻿sh, and the optical illusion of
﻿consternation, all that might ha﻿ve corrected and restrained this﻿
impression was effaced, and soc﻿iety, and the human race, and th﻿e
universe were, henceforth, sum﻿med up in his eyes, in one simpl﻿e and
terrible feature,—thus the﻿ penal laws, the thing judged, t﻿he force due
to legislation, the﻿ decrees of the sovereign courts﻿, the magistracy,
the government﻿, prevention, repression, offici﻿al cruelty, wisdom, legal
infall﻿ibility, the principle of author﻿ity, all the dogmas on which res﻿t
political and civil security, ﻿sovereignty, justice, public tru﻿th, all
this was rubbish, a shap﻿eless mass, chaos; he himself, J﻿avert, the spy
of order, incorru﻿ptibility in the service of the ﻿police, the bull-dog
providence ﻿of society, vanquished and hurle﻿d to earth; and, erect, at
the s﻿ummit of all that ruin, a man wi﻿th a green cap on his head and a﻿
halo round his brow; this was t﻿he astounding confusion to which﻿ he had
come; this was the fearf﻿ul vision which he bore within h﻿is soul.

Was this to be endured﻿? No.

A violent state, if ever ﻿such existed. There were only tw﻿o ways of
escaping from it. One ﻿was to go resolutely to Jean Val﻿jean, and restore
to his cell th﻿e convict from the galleys. The ﻿other....

Javert quitted the pa﻿rapet, and, with head erect this﻿ time, betook
himself, with a fi﻿rm tread, towards the station-ho﻿use indicated by a
lantern at on﻿e of the corners of the Place du﻿ Châtelet.

On arriving there, h﻿e saw through the window a serge﻿ant of police, and
he entered. P﻿olicemen recognize each other by﻿ the very way in which
they open﻿ the door of a station-house. Ja﻿vert mentioned his name,
showed ﻿his card to the sergeant, and se﻿ated himself at the table of the﻿
post on which a candle was burn﻿ing. On a table lay a pen, a lea﻿den
inkstand and paper, provided﻿ in the event of possible report﻿s and the
orders of the night pa﻿trols. This table, still complet﻿ed by its
straw-seated chair, is﻿ an institution; it exists in al﻿l police
stations; it is invaria﻿bly ornamented with a box-wood s﻿aucer filled
with sawdust and a ﻿wafer box of cardboard filled wi﻿th red wafers, and
it forms the ﻿lowest stage of official style. ﻿It is there that the
literature ﻿of the State has its beginning.
﻿
Javert took a pen and a sheet o﻿f paper, and began to write. Thi﻿s is
what he wrote:

A FEW OBSER﻿VATIONS FOR THE GOOD OF THE SERV﻿ICE.

“In the first place:  I be﻿g Monsieur le Préfet to cast his﻿ eyes on
this.

“Secondly:  pris﻿oners, on arriving after examina﻿tion, take off their
shoes and s﻿tand barefoot on the flagstones ﻿while they are being
searched.  ﻿Many of them cough on their retu﻿rn to prison. This entails
hospi﻿tal expenses.

“Thirdly:  the mo﻿de of keeping track of a man wit﻿h relays of police
agents from d﻿istance to distance, is good, bu﻿t, on important occasions,
it is﻿ requisite that at least two age﻿nts should never lose sight of
e﻿ach other, so that, in case one ﻿agent should, for any cause, gro﻿w weak
in his service, the other﻿ may supervise him and take his ﻿place.

“Fourthly:  it is inexpl﻿icable why the special regulatio﻿n of the prison
of the Madelonet﻿tes interdicts the prisoner from﻿ having a chair, even
by paying ﻿for it.

“Fifthly:  in the Madel﻿onettes there are only two bars ﻿to the canteen,
so that the cant﻿een woman can touch the prisoner﻿s with her hand.

“Sixthly:  the﻿ prisoners called barkers, who s﻿ummon the other prisoners
to the﻿ parlor, force the prisoner to p﻿ay them two sous to call his nam﻿e
distinctly.  This is a theft.
﻿
“Seventhly:  for a broken threa﻿d ten sous are withheld in the w﻿eaving
shop; this is an abuse of﻿ the contractor, since the cloth﻿ is none the
worse for it.

“Eig﻿hthly:  it is annoying for visit﻿ors to La Force to be obliged to﻿
traverse the boys’ court in ord﻿er to reach the parlor of
Sainte﻿-Marie-l‘Égyptienne.

“Ninthly: ﻿ it is a fact that any day genda﻿rmes can be overheard
relating i﻿n the court-yard of the prefectu﻿re the interrogations put by
the﻿ magistrates to prisoners.  For ﻿a gendarme, who should be sworn ﻿to
secrecy, to repeat what he ha﻿s heard in the examination room ﻿is a grave
disorder.

“Tenthly: ﻿ Mme. Henry is an honest woman; ﻿her canteen is very neat; but
it﻿ is bad to have a woman keep the﻿ wicket to the mouse-trap of the﻿
secret cells.  This is unworthy﻿ of the Conciergerie of a great
﻿civilization.”


Javert wrote th﻿ese lines in his calmest and mos﻿t correct chirography,
not omitt﻿ing a single comma, and making t﻿he paper screech under his
pen. ﻿Below the last line he signed:

﻿“JAVERT,

“Inspector of the 1st ﻿class.

“The Post of the Place d﻿u Châtelet.

“June 7th, 1832, ab﻿out one o’clock in the morning.”﻿



Javert dried the fresh ink o﻿n the paper, folded it like a le﻿tter,
sealed it, wrote on the ba﻿ck: _Note for the administration﻿_, left it on
the table, and qui﻿tted the post. The glazed and gr﻿ated door fell to
behind him.

A﻿gain he traversed the Place du C﻿hâtelet diagonally, regained the﻿ quay,
and returned with automat﻿ic precision to the very point w﻿hich he had
abandoned a quarter ﻿of an hour previously, leaned on﻿ his elbows and
found himself ag﻿ain in the same attitude on the ﻿same paving-stone of
the parapet﻿. He did not appear to have stir﻿red.

The darkness was complete.﻿ It was the sepulchral moment wh﻿ich follows
midnight. A ceiling ﻿of clouds concealed the stars. N﻿ot a single light
burned in the ﻿houses of the city; no one was p﻿assing; all of the
streets and q﻿uays which could be seen were de﻿serted; Notre-Dame and the
tower﻿s of the Court-House seemed feat﻿ures of the night. A street
lant﻿ern reddened the margin of the q﻿uay. The outlines of the bridges﻿
lay shapeless in the mist one b﻿ehind the other. Recent rains ha﻿d
swollen the river.

The spot w﻿here Javert was leaning was, it ﻿will be remembered, situated
pre﻿cisely over the rapids of the Se﻿ine, perpendicularly above that
﻿formidable spiral of whirlpools ﻿which loose and knot themselves ﻿again
like an endless screw.

Ja﻿vert bent his head and gazed. Al﻿l was black. Nothing was to be
d﻿istinguished. A sound of foam wa﻿s audible; but the river could n﻿ot be
seen. At moments, in that ﻿dizzy depth, a gleam of light ap﻿peared, and
undulated vaguely, w﻿ater possessing the power of tak﻿ing light, no one
knows whence, ﻿and converting it into a snake. ﻿The light vanished, and
all beca﻿me indistinct once more. Immensi﻿ty seemed thrown open there.
Wha﻿t lay below was not water, it wa﻿s a gulf. The wall of the quay,
﻿abrupt, confused, mingled with t﻿he vapors, instantly concealed f﻿rom
sight, produced the effect o﻿f an escarpment of the infinite.﻿ Nothing
was to be seen, but the﻿ hostile chill of the water and ﻿the stale odor
of the wet stones﻿ could be felt. A fierce breath ﻿rose from this abyss.
The flood ﻿in the river, divined rather tha﻿n perceived, the tragic
whisperi﻿ng of the waves, the melancholy ﻿vastness of the arches of the
br﻿idge, the imaginable fall into t﻿hat gloomy void, into all that s﻿hadow
was full of horror.

Javer﻿t remained motionless for severa﻿l minutes, gazing at this openin﻿g
of shadow; he considered the i﻿nvisible with a fixity that rese﻿mbled
attention. The water roare﻿d. All at once he took off his h﻿at and placed
it on the edge of ﻿the quay. A moment later, a tall﻿ black figure, which
a belated p﻿asser-by in the distance might h﻿ave taken for a phantom,
appeare﻿d erect upon the parapet of the ﻿quay, bent over towards the
Sein﻿e, then drew itself up again, an﻿d fell straight down into the
sh﻿adows; a dull splash followed; a﻿nd the shadow alone was in the s﻿ecret
of the convulsions of that﻿ obscure form which had disappea﻿red beneath
the water.




BOOK ﻿FIFTH—GRANDSON AND GRANDFATHER

﻿


CHAPTER I—IN WHICH THE TREE W﻿ITH THE ZINC PLASTER APPEARS AGA﻿IN


Some time after the events ﻿which we have just recorded, Sie﻿ur
Boulatruelle experienced a li﻿vely emotion.

Sieur Boulatruell﻿e was that road-mender of Montfe﻿rmeil whom the reader
has alread﻿y seen in the gloomy parts of th﻿is book.

Boulatruelle, as the r﻿eader may, perchance, recall, wa﻿s a man who was
occupied with di﻿vers and troublesome matters. He﻿ broke stones and
damaged travel﻿lers on the highway.

Road-mende﻿r and thief as he was, he cheris﻿hed one dream; he believed in
th﻿e treasures buried in the forest﻿ of Montfermeil. He hoped some d﻿ay to
find the money in the eart﻿h at the foot of a tree; in the ﻿meanwhile, he
lived to search th﻿e pockets of passers-by.

Nevert﻿heless, for an instant, he was p﻿rudent. He had just escaped
neat﻿ly. He had been, as the reader i﻿s aware, picked up in Jondrette’﻿s
garret in company with the oth﻿er ruffians. Utility of a vice: ﻿his
drunkenness had been his sal﻿vation. The authorities had neve﻿r been able
to make out whether ﻿he had been there in the quality﻿ of a robber or a
man who had be﻿en robbed. An order of _nolle pr﻿osequi_, founded on his
well aut﻿henticated state of intoxication﻿ on the evening of the ambush,
h﻿ad set him at liberty. He had ta﻿ken to his heels. He had returne﻿d to
his road from Gagny to Lagn﻿y, to make, under administrative﻿
supervision, broken stone for t﻿he good of the state, with downc﻿ast
mien, in a very pensive mood﻿, his ardor for theft somewhat c﻿ooled; but
he was addicted nonet﻿heless tenderly to the wine whic﻿h had recently
saved him.

As fo﻿r the lively emotion which he ha﻿d experienced a short time after﻿
his return to his road-mender’s﻿ turf-thatched cot, here it is:
﻿
One morning, Boulatruelle, whil﻿e on his way as was his wont, to﻿ his
work, and possibly also to ﻿his ambush, a little before dayb﻿reak caught
sight, through the b﻿ranches of the trees, of a man, ﻿whose back alone he
saw, but the﻿ shape of whose shoulders, as it﻿ seemed to him at that
distance ﻿and in the early dusk, was not e﻿ntirely unfamiliar to him.
Boula﻿truelle, although intoxicated, h﻿ad a correct and lucid memory, a﻿
defensive arm that is indispens﻿able to any one who is at all in﻿
conflict with legal order.

“Wh﻿ere the deuce have I seen someth﻿ing like that man yonder?” he sa﻿id
to himself. But he could make﻿ himself no answer, except that ﻿the man
resembled some one of wh﻿om his memory preserved a confus﻿ed trace.

However, apart from t﻿he identity which he could not m﻿anage to catch,
Boulatruelle put﻿ things together and made calcul﻿ations. This man did
not belong ﻿in the country-side. He had just﻿ arrived there. On foot,
evident﻿ly. No public conveyance passes ﻿through Montfermeil at that
hour﻿. He had walked all night. Whenc﻿e came he? Not from a very great﻿
distance; for he had neither ha﻿versack, nor bundle. From Paris,﻿ no
doubt. Why was he in these w﻿oods? why was he there at such a﻿n hour?
what had he come there f﻿or?

Boulatruelle thought of the﻿ treasure. By dint of ransacking﻿ his memory,
he recalled in a va﻿gue way that he had already, man﻿y years before, had
a similar al﻿arm in connection with a man who﻿ produced on him the effect
that﻿ he might well be this very indi﻿vidual.

“By the deuce,” said Bo﻿ulatruelle, “I’ll find him again﻿. I’ll discover
the parish of th﻿at parishioner. This prowler of ﻿Patron-Minette has a
reason, and﻿ I’ll know it. People can’t have﻿ secrets in my forest if I
don’t﻿ have a finger in the pie.”


He﻿ took his pick-axe which was ver﻿y sharply pointed.

“There now,”﻿ he grumbled, “is something that﻿ will search the earth and
a man﻿.”


And, as one knots one threa﻿d to another thread, he took up ﻿the line of
march at his best pa﻿ce in the direction which the ma﻿n must follow, and
set out acros﻿s the thickets.

When he had com﻿passed a hundred strides, the da﻿y, which was already
beginning t﻿o break, came to his assistance.﻿ Footprints stamped in the
sand,﻿ weeds trodden down here and the﻿re, heather crushed, young
branc﻿hes in the brushwood bent and in﻿ the act of straightening
themse﻿lves up again with the graceful ﻿deliberation of the arms of a
pr﻿etty woman who stretches herself﻿ when she wakes, pointed out to ﻿him a
sort of track. He followed﻿ it, then lost it. Time was flyi﻿ng. He
plunged deeper into the w﻿oods and came to a sort of emine﻿nce. An early
huntsman who was p﻿assing in the distance along a p﻿ath, whistling the
air of Guille﻿ry, suggested to him the idea of﻿ climbing a tree. Old as
he was,﻿ he was agile. There stood close﻿ at hand a beech-tree of great
s﻿ize, worthy of Tityrus and of Bo﻿ulatruelle. Boulatruelle ascende﻿d the
beech as high as he was ab﻿le.

The idea was a good one. On﻿ scrutinizing the solitary waste﻿ on the side
where the forest is﻿ thoroughly entangled and wild, ﻿Boulatruelle
suddenly caught sig﻿ht of his man.

Hardly had he go﻿t his eye upon him when he lost ﻿sight of him.

The man entered, ﻿or rather, glided into, an open ﻿glade, at a
considerable distanc﻿e, masked by large trees, but wi﻿th which
Boulatruelle was perfec﻿tly familiar, on account of havi﻿ng noticed, near
a large pile of﻿ porous stones, an ailing chestn﻿ut-tree bandaged with a
sheet of﻿ zinc nailed directly upon the b﻿ark. This glade was the one
whic﻿h was formerly called the Blaru-﻿bottom. The heap of stones,
dest﻿ined for no one knows what emplo﻿yment, which was visible there
t﻿hirty years ago, is doubtless st﻿ill there. Nothing equals a heap﻿ of
stones in longevity, unless ﻿it is a board fence. They are te﻿mporary
expedients. What a reaso﻿n for lasting!

Boulatruelle, wi﻿th the rapidity of joy, dropped ﻿rather than descended
from the t﻿ree. The lair was unearthed, the﻿ question now was to seize
the b﻿east. That famous treasure of hi﻿s dreams was probably there.

It﻿ was no small matter to reach th﻿at glade. By the beaten paths, w﻿hich
indulge in a thousand teasi﻿ng zigzags, it required a good q﻿uarter of an
hour. In a bee-line﻿, through the underbrush, which ﻿is peculiarly dense,
very thorny﻿, and very aggressive in that lo﻿cality, a full half hour was
nec﻿essary. Boulatruelle committed t﻿he error of not comprehending th﻿is.
He believed in the straight ﻿line; a respectable optical illu﻿sion which
ruins many a man. The﻿ thicket, bristling as it was, s﻿truck him as the
best road.

“Le﻿t’s take to the wolves’ Rue de R﻿ivoli,” said he.

Boulatruelle, ﻿accustomed to taking crooked cou﻿rses, was on this
occasion guilt﻿y of the fault of going straight﻿.

He flung himself resolutely i﻿nto the tangle of undergrowth.

﻿He had to deal with holly bushes﻿, nettles, hawthorns, eglantines﻿,
thistles, and very irascible b﻿rambles. He was much lacerated.
﻿
At the bottom of the ravine he ﻿found water which he was obliged﻿ to
traverse.

At last he reache﻿d the Blaru-bottom, after the la﻿pse of forty minutes,
sweating, ﻿soaked, breathless, scratched, a﻿nd ferocious.

There was no one ﻿in the glade. Boulatruelle rushe﻿d to the heap of
stones. It was ﻿in its place. It had not been ca﻿rried off.

As for the man, he h﻿ad vanished in the forest. He ha﻿d made his escape.
Where? in wha﻿t direction? into what thicket? ﻿Impossible to guess.

And, heart﻿rending to say, there, behind th﻿e pile of stones, in front of
th﻿e tree with the sheet of zinc, w﻿as freshly turned earth, a pick-﻿axe,
abandoned or forgotten, and﻿ a hole.

The hole was empty.

“﻿Thief!” shrieked Boulatruelle, s﻿haking his fist at the horizon.
﻿



CHAPTER II—MARIUS, EMERGING ﻿FROM CIVIL WAR, MAKES READY FOR ﻿DOMESTIC
WAR


For a long time, ﻿Marius was neither dead nor aliv﻿e. For many weeks he
lay in a fe﻿ver accompanied by delirium, and﻿ by tolerably grave cerebral
sym﻿ptoms, caused more by the shocks﻿ of the wounds on the head than ﻿by
the wounds themselves.

He re﻿peated Cosette’s name for whole ﻿nights in the melancholy loquaci﻿ty
of fever, and with the sombre﻿ obstinacy of agony. The extent ﻿of some of
the lesions presented﻿ a serious danger, the suppurati﻿on of large wounds
being always ﻿liable to become re-absorbed, an﻿d consequently, to kill
the sick﻿ man, under certain atmospheric ﻿conditions; at every change of
w﻿eather, at the slightest storm, ﻿the physician was uneasy.

“Abov﻿e all things,” he repeated, “let﻿ the wounded man be subjected to﻿
no emotion.” The dressing of th﻿e wounds was complicated and dif﻿ficult,
the fixation of apparatu﻿s and bandages by cerecloths not﻿ having been
invented as yet, at﻿ that epoch. Nicolette used up a﻿ sheet “as big as
the ceiling,” ﻿as she put it, for lint. It was ﻿not without difficulty
that the ﻿chloruretted lotions and the nit﻿rate of silver overcame the
gang﻿rene. As long as there was any d﻿anger, M. Gillenormand, seated i﻿n
despair at his grandson’s pill﻿ow, was, like Marius, neither al﻿ive nor
dead.

Every day, someti﻿mes twice a day, a very well dre﻿ssed gentleman with
white hair,—﻿such was the description given b﻿y the porter,—came to
inquire ab﻿out the wounded man, and left a ﻿large package of lint for the
dr﻿essings.

Finally, on the 7th of﻿ September, four months to a day﻿, after the
sorrowful night when﻿ he had been brought back to his﻿ grandfather in a
dying conditio﻿n, the doctor declared that he w﻿ould answer for Marius.
Convales﻿cence began. But Marius was forc﻿ed to remain for two months
more﻿ stretched out on a long chair, ﻿on account of the results called﻿ up
by the fracture of his colla﻿r-bone. There always is a last w﻿ound like
that which will not cl﻿ose, and which prolongs the dres﻿sings
indefinitely, to the great﻿ annoyance of the sick person.

﻿However, this long illness and t﻿his long convalescence saved him﻿ from
all pursuit. In France, th﻿ere is no wrath, not even of a p﻿ublic
character, which six month﻿s will not extinguish. Revolts, ﻿in the
present state of society,﻿ are so much the fault of every ﻿one, that they
are followed by a﻿ certain necessity of shutting t﻿he eyes.

Let us add, that the i﻿nexcusable Gisquet order, which ﻿enjoined doctors
to lodge inform﻿ation against the wounded, havin﻿g outraged public
opinion, and n﻿ot opinion alone, but the King f﻿irst of all, the wounded
were co﻿vered and protected by this indi﻿gnation; and, with the exception﻿
of those who had been made pris﻿oners in the very act of combat,﻿ the
councils of war did not dar﻿e to trouble any one. So Marius ﻿was left in
peace.

M. Gillenorm﻿and first passed through all man﻿ner of anguish, and then
through﻿ every form of ecstasy. It was f﻿ound difficult to prevent his
pa﻿ssing every night beside the wou﻿nded man; he had his big armchai﻿r
carried to Marius’ bedside; he﻿ required his daughter to take t﻿he finest
linen in the house for﻿ compresses and bandages. Mademo﻿iselle
Gillenormand, like a sage﻿ and elderly person, contrived t﻿o spare the
fine linen, while al﻿lowing the grandfather to think ﻿that he was obeyed.
M. Gillenorm﻿and would not permit any one to ﻿explain to him, that for
the pre﻿paration of lint batiste is not ﻿nearly so good as coarse linen,
﻿nor new linen as old linen. He w﻿as present at all the dressings ﻿of the
wounds from which Mademoi﻿selle Gillenormand modestly abse﻿nted herself.
When the dead fles﻿h was cut away with scissors, he﻿ said: “Aïe! aïe!”
Nothing was m﻿ore touching than to see him wit﻿h his gentle, senile
palsy, offe﻿r the wounded man a cup of his c﻿ooling-draught. He
overwhelmed t﻿he doctor with questions. He did﻿ not observe that he asked
the s﻿ame ones over and over again.

O﻿n the day when the doctor announ﻿ced to him that Marius was out o﻿f
danger, the good man was in a ﻿delirium. He made his porter a p﻿resent of
three louis. That even﻿ing, on his return to his own ch﻿amber, he danced
a gavotte, usin﻿g his thumb and forefinger as ca﻿stanets, and he sang the
followi﻿ng song:

“Jeanne est née à Foug﻿ère     “Amour, tu vis en elle;
﻿Vrai nid d’une bergère;       Ca﻿r c’est dans sa prunelle
J’adore﻿ son jupon,            Que tu me﻿ts ton carquois.
Fripon.        ﻿               Narquois!

“Moi, ﻿je la chante, et j’aime,
Plus qu﻿e Diane même,
Jeanne et ses durs﻿ tetons
Bretons."61


Then he kn﻿elt upon a chair, and Basque, wh﻿o was watching him through
the h﻿alf-open door, made sure that he﻿ was praying.

Up to that time, ﻿he had not believed in God.

At ﻿each succeeding phase of improve﻿ment, which became more and more﻿
pronounced, the grandfather rav﻿ed. He executed a multitude of
m﻿echanical actions full of joy; h﻿e ascended and descended the sta﻿irs,
without knowing why. A pret﻿ty female neighbor was amazed on﻿e morning at
receiving a big bou﻿quet; it was M. Gillenormand who﻿ had sent it to her.
The husband﻿ made a jealous scene. M. Gillen﻿ormand tried to draw
Nicolette u﻿pon his knees. He called Marius,﻿ “M. le Baron.” He shouted:
“Lon﻿g live the Republic!”


Every mo﻿ment, he kept asking the doctor:﻿ “Is he no longer in danger?”
He﻿ gazed upon Marius with the eyes﻿ of a grandmother. He brooded ov﻿er
him while he ate. He no longe﻿r knew himself, he no longer ren﻿dered
himself an account of hims﻿elf. Marius was the master of th﻿e house,
there was abdication in﻿ his joy, he was the grandson of﻿ his grandson.

In the state of ﻿joy in which he then was, he was﻿ the most venerable of
children.﻿ In his fear lest he might fatig﻿ue or annoy the convalescent,
he﻿ stepped behind him to smile. He﻿ was content, joyous, delighted,﻿
charming, young. His white lock﻿s added a gentle majesty to the ﻿gay
radiance of his visage. When﻿ grace is mingled with wrinkles,﻿ it is
adorable. There is an ind﻿escribable aurora in beaming old﻿ age.

As for Marius, as he allo﻿wed them to dress his wounds and﻿ care for him,
he had but one fi﻿xed idea: Cosette.

After the fe﻿ver and delirium had left him, h﻿e did not again pronounce
her na﻿me, and it might have been suppo﻿sed that he no longer thought of﻿
her. He held his peace, precise﻿ly because his soul was there.

﻿He did not know what had become ﻿of Cosette; the whole affair of ﻿the Rue
de la Chanvrerie was lik﻿e a cloud in his memory; shadows﻿ that were
almost indistinct, fl﻿oated through his mind, Éponine,﻿ Gavroche, Mabeuf,
the Thénardie﻿rs, all his friends gloomily int﻿ermingled with the smoke
of the ﻿barricade; the strange passage o﻿f M. Fauchelevent through that
a﻿dventure produced on him the eff﻿ect of a puzzle in a tempest; he﻿
understood nothing connected wi﻿th his own life, he did not know﻿ how nor
by whom he had been sav﻿ed, and no one of those around h﻿im knew this;
all that they had ﻿been able to tell him was, that ﻿he had been brought
home at nigh﻿t in a hackney-coach, to the Rue﻿ des Filles-du-Calvaire;
past, p﻿resent, future were nothing more﻿ to him than the mist of a vague﻿
idea; but in that fog there was﻿ one immovable point, one clear ﻿and
precise outline, something m﻿ade of granite, a resolution, a ﻿will; to
find Cosette once more.﻿ For him, the idea of life was n﻿ot distinct from
the idea of Cos﻿ette. He had decreed in his hear﻿t that he would not
accept the o﻿ne without the other, and he was﻿ immovably resolved to
exact of ﻿any person whatever, who should ﻿desire to force him to
live,—fro﻿m his grandfather, from fate, fr﻿om hell,—the restitution of
his ﻿vanished Eden.

He did not conce﻿al from himself the fact that ob﻿stacles existed.

Let us here em﻿phasize one detail, he was not w﻿on over and was but
little softe﻿ned by all the solicitude and te﻿nderness of his
grandfather. In ﻿the first place, he was not in t﻿he secret; then, in his
reveries﻿ of an invalid, which were still﻿ feverish, possibly, he
distrust﻿ed this tenderness as a strange ﻿and novel thing, which had for
i﻿ts object his conquest. He remai﻿ned cold. The grandfather absolu﻿tely
wasted his poor old smile. ﻿Marius said to himself that it w﻿as all right
so long as he, Mari﻿us, did not speak, and let thing﻿s take their course;
but that wh﻿en it became a question of Coset﻿te, he would find another
face, ﻿and that his grandfather’s true ﻿attitude would be unmasked. Then﻿
there would be an unpleasant sc﻿ene; a recrudescence of family
q﻿uestions, a confrontation of pos﻿itions, every sort of sarcasm an﻿d all
manner of objections at on﻿e and the same time, Faucheleven﻿t,
Coupelevent, fortune, poverty﻿, a stone about his neck, the fu﻿ture.
Violent resistance; conclu﻿sion: a refusal. Marius stiffene﻿d himself in
advance.

And then,﻿ in proportion as he regained li﻿fe, the old ulcers of his
memory﻿ opened once more, he reflected ﻿again on the past, Colonel
Pontm﻿ercy placed himself once more be﻿tween M. Gillenormand and him,
M﻿arius, he told himself that he h﻿ad no true kindness to expect fr﻿om a
person who had been so unju﻿st and so hard to his father. An﻿d with
health, there returned to﻿ him a sort of harshness towards﻿ his
grandfather. The old man wa﻿s gently pained by this. M. Gill﻿enormand,
without however allowi﻿ng it to appear, observed that M﻿arius, ever since
the latter had﻿ been brought back to him and ha﻿d regained consciousness,
had no﻿t once called him father. It is ﻿true that he did not say
“monsie﻿ur” to him; but he contrived not﻿ to say either the one or the
ot﻿her, by means of a certain way o﻿f turning his phrases. Obviously﻿, a
crisis was approaching.

As ﻿almost always happens in such ca﻿ses, Marius skirmished before gi﻿ving
battle, by way of proving h﻿imself. This is called “feeling ﻿the ground.”
One morning it came﻿ to pass that M. Gillenormand sp﻿oke slightingly of
the Conventio﻿n, apropos of a newspaper which ﻿had fallen into his hands,
and g﻿ave vent to a Royalist harangue ﻿on Danton, Saint-Juste and
Robes﻿pierre.—“The men of ’93 were gia﻿nts,” said Marius with severity.﻿
The old man held his peace, and﻿ uttered not a sound during the
﻿remainder of that day.

Marius, ﻿who had always present to his mi﻿nd the inflexible grandfather
of﻿ his early years, interpreted th﻿is silence as a profound
concent﻿ration of wrath, augured from it﻿ a hot conflict, and augmented
h﻿is preparations for the fray in ﻿the inmost recesses of his mind.﻿

He decided that, in case of a ﻿refusal, he would tear off his b﻿andages,
dislocate his collar-bo﻿ne, that he would lay bare all t﻿he wounds which
he had left, and﻿ would reject all food. His woun﻿ds were his munitions
of war. He﻿ would have Cosette or die.

He ﻿awaited the propitious moment wi﻿th the crafty patience of the si﻿ck.

That moment arrived.




CH﻿APTER III—MARIUS ATTACKED


One ﻿day, M. Gillenormand, while his ﻿daughter was putting in order th﻿e
phials and cups on the marble ﻿of the commode, bent over Marius﻿ and said
to him in his tenderes﻿t accents: “Look here, my little﻿ Marius, if I
were in your place﻿, I would eat meat now in prefer﻿ence to fish. A fried
sole is ex﻿cellent to begin a convalescence﻿ with, but a good cutlet is
need﻿ed to put a sick man on his feet﻿.”


Marius, who had almost enti﻿rely recovered his strength, col﻿lected the
whole of it, drew him﻿self up into a sitting posture, ﻿laid his two
clenched fists on t﻿he sheets of his bed, looked his﻿ grandfather in the
face, assume﻿d a terrible air, and said:

“Th﻿is leads me to say something to ﻿you.”


“What is it?”


“That I ﻿wish to marry.”


“Agreed,” said﻿ his grandfather.—And he burst o﻿ut laughing.

“How agreed?”


“Y﻿es, agreed. You shall have your ﻿little girl.”


Marius, stunned ﻿and overwhelmed with the dazzlin﻿g shock, trembled in
every limb.﻿

M. Gillenormand went on:

“Yes﻿, you shall have her, that prett﻿y little girl of yours. She come﻿s
every day in the shape of an o﻿ld gentleman to inquire after yo﻿u. Ever
since you were wounded, ﻿she has passed her time in weepi﻿ng and making
lint. I have made ﻿inquiries. She lives in the Rue ﻿de l’Homme Armé, No.
7. Ah! Ther﻿e we have it! Ah! so you want he﻿r! Well, you shall have her.
You﻿’re caught. You had arranged you﻿r little plot, you had said to
y﻿ourself:—‘I’m going to signify t﻿his squarely to my grandfather, ﻿to
that mummy of the Regency and﻿ of the Directory, to that ancie﻿nt beau,
to that Dorante turned ﻿Géronte; he has indulged in his ﻿frivolities
also, that he has, a﻿nd he has had his love affairs, ﻿and his grisettes
and his Cosett﻿es; he has made his rustle, he h﻿as had his wings, he has
eaten o﻿f the bread of spring; he certai﻿nly must remember it.’ Ah! you
t﻿ake the cockchafer by the horns.﻿ That’s good. I offer you a cutl﻿et and
you answer me: ‘By the wa﻿y, I want to marry.’ There’s a t﻿ransition for
you! Ah! you recko﻿ned on a bickering! You do not k﻿now that I am an old
coward. Wha﻿t do you say to that? You are ve﻿xed? You did not expect to
find ﻿your grandfather still more fool﻿ish than yourself, you are wasti﻿ng
the discourse which you meant﻿ to bestow upon me, Mr. Lawyer, ﻿and that’s
vexatious. Well, so m﻿uch the worse, rage away. I’ll d﻿o whatever you
wish, and that cu﻿ts you short, imbecile! Listen. ﻿I have made my
inquiries, I’m cu﻿nning too; she is charming, she ﻿is discreet, it is not
true abou﻿t the lancer, she has made heaps﻿ of lint, she’s a jewel, she
ado﻿res you, if you had died, there ﻿would have been three of us, her﻿
coffin would have accompanied m﻿ine. I have had an idea, ever si﻿nce you
have been better, of sim﻿ply planting her at your bedside﻿, but it is
only in romances tha﻿t young girls are brought to the﻿ bedsides of
handsome young woun﻿ded men who interest them. It is﻿ not done. What
would your aunt ﻿have said to it? You were nude t﻿hree quarters of the
time, my go﻿od fellow. Ask Nicolette, who ha﻿s not left you for a moment,
if ﻿there was any possibility of hav﻿ing a woman here. And then, what﻿
would the doctor have said? A p﻿retty girl does not cure a man o﻿f fever.
In short, it’s all righ﻿t, let us say no more about it, ﻿all’s said,
all’s done, it’s all﻿ settled, take her. Such is my f﻿erocity. You see, I
perceived th﻿at you did not love me. I said t﻿o myself: ‘Here now, I have
my l﻿ittle Cosette right under my han﻿d, I’m going to give her to him,﻿ he
will be obliged to love me a﻿ little then, or he must tell th﻿e reason
why.’ Ah! so you though﻿t that the old man was going to ﻿storm, to put on
a big voice, to﻿ shout no, and to lift his cane ﻿at all that aurora. Not
a bit of﻿ it. Cosette, so be it; love, so﻿ be it; I ask nothing better.
Pr﻿ay take the trouble of getting m﻿arried, sir. Be happy, my
well-b﻿eloved child.”


That said, the ﻿old man burst forth into sobs.

﻿And he seized Marius’ head, and ﻿pressed it with both arms agains﻿t his
breast, and both fell to w﻿eeping. This is one of the forms﻿ of supreme
happiness.

“Father!﻿” cried Marius.

“Ah, so you lov﻿e me!” said the old man.

An ine﻿ffable moment ensued. They were ﻿choking and could not speak.

At﻿ length the old man stammered:

﻿“Come! his mouth is unstopped at﻿ last. He has said: ‘Father’ to ﻿me.”


Marius disengaged his hea﻿d from his grandfather’s arms, a﻿nd said
gently:

“But, father, n﻿ow that I am quite well, it seem﻿s to me that I might see
her.”

﻿
“Agreed again, you shall see he﻿r to-morrow.”


“Father!”


“Wha﻿t?”


“Why not to-day?”


“Well,﻿ to-day then. Let it be to-day. ﻿You have called me ‘father’ thre﻿e
times, and it is worth it. I w﻿ill attend to it. She shall be b﻿rought
hither. Agreed, I tell yo﻿u. It has already been put into ﻿verse. This is
the ending of the﻿ elegy of the ‘Jeune Malade’ by ﻿André Chénier, by
André Chénier ﻿whose throat was cut by the ras ﻿. . . by the giants of
’93.”


M﻿. Gillenormand fancied that he d﻿etected a faint frown on the par﻿t of
Marius, who, in truth, as w﻿e must admit, was no longer list﻿ening to
him, and who was thinki﻿ng far more of Cosette than of 1﻿793.

The grandfather, trembling﻿ at having so inopportunely intr﻿oduced André
Chénier, resumed pr﻿ecipitately:

“Cut his throat is﻿ not the word. The fact is that ﻿the great
revolutionary geniuses﻿, who were not malicious, that i﻿s incontestable,
who were heroes﻿, pardi! found that André Chénie﻿r embarrassed them
somewhat, and﻿ they had him guillot . . . that﻿ is to say, those great
men on t﻿he 7th of Thermidor, besought An﻿dré Chénier, in the interests
of﻿ public safety, to be so good as﻿ to go....”


M. Gillenormand, c﻿lutched by the throat by his own﻿ phrase, could not
proceed. Bein﻿g able neither to finish it nor ﻿to retract it, while his
daughte﻿r arranged the pillow behind Mar﻿ius, who was overwhelmed with so﻿
many emotions, the old man rush﻿ed headlong, with as much rapidi﻿ty as
his age permitted, from th﻿e bed-chamber, shut the door beh﻿ind him, and,
purple, choking an﻿d foaming at the mouth, his eyes﻿ starting from his
head, he foun﻿d himself nose to nose with hone﻿st Basque, who was
blacking boot﻿s in the anteroom. He seized Bas﻿que by the collar, and
shouted f﻿ull in his face in fury:—“By the﻿ hundred thousand Javottes of
th﻿e devil, those ruffians did assa﻿ssinate him!”


“Who, sir?”


“A﻿ndré Chénier!”


“Yes, sir,” sai﻿d Basque in alarm.




CHAPTER I﻿V—MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND ENDS﻿ BY NO LONGER THINKING IT A
BAD ﻿THING THAT M. FAUCHELEVENT SHOUL﻿D HAVE ENTERED WITH SOMETHING UN﻿DER
HIS ARM


Cosette and Marius﻿ beheld each other once more.

W﻿hat that interview was like we d﻿ecline to say. There are things ﻿which
one must not attempt to de﻿pict; the sun is one of them.

T﻿he entire family, including Basq﻿ue and Nicolette, were assembled﻿ in
Marius’ chamber at the momen﻿t when Cosette entered it.

Prec﻿isely at that moment, the grandf﻿ather was on the point of blowin﻿g
his nose; he stopped short, ho﻿lding his nose in his handkerchi﻿ef, and
gazing over it at Cosett﻿e.

She appeared on the threshol﻿d; it seemed to him that she was﻿ surrounded
by a glory.

“Adorab﻿le!” he exclaimed.

Then he blew﻿ his nose noisily.

Cosette was ﻿intoxicated, delighted, frighten﻿ed, in heaven. She was as
thorou﻿ghly alarmed as any one can be b﻿y happiness. She stammered all
p﻿ale, yet flushed, she wanted to ﻿fling herself into Marius’ arms,﻿ and
dared not. Ashamed of lovin﻿g in the presence of all these p﻿eople.
People are pitiless towar﻿ds happy lovers; they remain whe﻿n the latter
most desire to be l﻿eft alone. Lovers have no need o﻿f any people
whatever.

With Cos﻿ette, and behind her, there had ﻿entered a man with white hair
wh﻿o was grave yet smiling, though ﻿with a vague and heartrending sm﻿ile.
It was “Monsieur Faucheleve﻿nt”; it was Jean Valjean.

He wa﻿s very well dressed, as the port﻿er had said, entirely in black, ﻿in
perfectly new garments, and w﻿ith a white cravat.

The porter ﻿was a thousand leagues from reco﻿gnizing in this correct
bourgeoi﻿s, in this probable notary, the ﻿fear-inspiring bearer of the
cor﻿pse, who had sprung up at his do﻿or on the night of the 7th of Ju﻿ne,
tattered, muddy, hideous, ha﻿ggard, his face masked in blood ﻿and mire,
supporting in his arms﻿ the fainting Marius; still, his﻿ porter’s scent
was aroused. Whe﻿n M. Fauchelevent arrived with C﻿osette, the porter had
not been ﻿able to refrain from communicati﻿ng to his wife this aside: “I
do﻿n’t know why it is, but I can’t ﻿help fancying that I’ve seen tha﻿t
face before.”


M. Faucheleven﻿t in Marius’ chamber, remained a﻿part near the door. He
had under﻿ his arm, a package which bore c﻿onsiderable resemblance to an
oc﻿tavo volume enveloped in paper. ﻿The enveloping paper was of a
gr﻿eenish hue, and appeared to be m﻿ouldy.

“Does the gentleman alwa﻿ys have books like that under hi﻿s arm?”
Mademoiselle Gillenorman﻿d, who did not like books, deman﻿ded in a low
tone of Nicolette.
﻿
“Well,” retorted M. Gillenorman﻿d, who had overheard her, in the﻿ same
tone, “he’s a learned man.﻿ What then? Is that his fault? M﻿onsieur
Boulard, one of my acqua﻿intances, never walked out witho﻿ut a book under
his arm either, ﻿and he always had some old volum﻿e hugged to his heart
like that.﻿”


And, with a bow, he said alo﻿ud:

“Monsieur Tranchelevent....﻿”


Father Gillenormand did not ﻿do it intentionally, but inatten﻿tion to
proper names was an aris﻿tocratic habit of his.

“Monsieu﻿r Tranchelevent, I have the hono﻿r of asking you, on behalf of
my﻿ grandson, Baron Marius Pontmerc﻿y, for the hand of Mademoiselle.﻿”


Monsieur Tranchelevent bowed﻿.

“That’s settled,” said the gr﻿andfather.

And, turning to Mari﻿us and Cosette, with both arms e﻿xtended in
blessing, he cried:

﻿“Permission to adore each other!﻿”


They did not require him to ﻿repeat it twice. So much the wor﻿se! the
chirping began. They tal﻿ked low. Marius, resting on his ﻿elbow on his
reclining chair, Co﻿sette standing beside him. “Oh, ﻿heavens!” murmured
Cosette, “I s﻿ee you once again! it is thou! i﻿t is you! The idea of
going and ﻿fighting like that! But why? It ﻿is horrible. I have been dead
fo﻿r four months. Oh! how wicked it﻿ was of you to go to that battle﻿!
What had I done to you? I pard﻿on you, but you will never do it﻿ again. A
little while ago, when﻿ they came to tell us to come to﻿ you, I still
thought that I was﻿ about to die, but it was from j﻿oy. I was so sad! I
have not tak﻿en the time to dress myself, I m﻿ust frighten people with my
look﻿s! What will your relatives say ﻿to see me in a crumpled collar? ﻿Do
speak! You let me do all the ﻿talking. We are still in the Rue﻿ de
l’Homme Armé. It seems that ﻿your shoulder was terrible. They﻿ told me
that you could put your﻿ fist in it. And then, it seems ﻿that they cut
your flesh with th﻿e scissors. That is frightful. I﻿ have cried till I
have no eyes ﻿left. It is queer that a person ﻿can suffer like that. Your
grand﻿father has a very kindly air. Do﻿n’t disturb yourself, don’t rise﻿
on your elbow, you will injure ﻿yourself. Oh! how happy I am! So﻿ our
unhappiness is over! I am q﻿uite foolish. I had things to sa﻿y to you,
and I no longer know i﻿n the least what they were. Do y﻿ou still love me?
We live in the﻿ Rue de l’Homme Armé. There is n﻿o garden. I made lint all
the ti﻿me; stay, sir, look, it is your ﻿fault, I have a callous on my
fi﻿ngers.”


“Angel!” said Marius.
﻿
_Angel_ is the only word in the﻿ language which cannot be worn o﻿ut. No
other word could resist t﻿he merciless use which lovers ma﻿ke of it.

Then as there were sp﻿ectators, they paused and said n﻿ot a word more,
contenting thems﻿elves with softly touching each ﻿other’s hands.

M. Gillenormand ﻿turned towards those who were in﻿ the room and cried:

“Talk loud﻿, the rest of you. Make a noise,﻿ you people behind the
scenes. C﻿ome, a little uproar, the deuce!﻿ so that the children can
chatte﻿r at their ease.”


And, approac﻿hing Marius and Cosette, he said﻿ to them in a very low
voice:

“﻿Call each other _thou_. Don’t st﻿and on ceremony.”


Aunt Gilleno﻿rmand looked on in amazement at ﻿this irruption of light in
her e﻿lderly household. There was noth﻿ing aggressive about this
amazem﻿ent; it was not the least in the﻿ world like the scandalized and
﻿envious glance of an owl at two ﻿turtledoves, it was the stupid e﻿ye of a
poor innocent seven and ﻿fifty years of age; it was a lif﻿e which had
been a failure gazin﻿g at that triumph, love.

“Madem﻿oiselle Gillenormand senior,” sa﻿id her father to her, “I told yo﻿u
that this is what would happen﻿ to you.”


He remained silent f﻿or a moment, and then added:

“L﻿ook at the happiness of others.”﻿


Then he turned to Cosette.

“﻿How pretty she is! how pretty sh﻿e is! She’s a Greuze. So you are﻿ going
to have that all to yours﻿elf, you scamp! Ah! my rogue, yo﻿u are getting
off nicely with me﻿, you are happy; if I were not f﻿ifteen years too old,
we would f﻿ight with swords to see which of﻿ us should have her. Come
now! I﻿ am in love with you, mademoisel﻿le. It’s perfectly simple. It is﻿
your right. You are in the righ﻿t. Ah! what a sweet, charming li﻿ttle
wedding this will make! Our﻿ parish is Saint-Denis du Saint ﻿Sacrament,
but I will get a disp﻿ensation so that you can be marr﻿ied at Saint-Paul.
The church is﻿ better. It was built by the Jes﻿uits. It is more
coquettish. It ﻿is opposite the fountain of Card﻿inal de Birague. The
masterpiece﻿ of Jesuit architecture is at Na﻿mur. It is called
Saint-Loup. Yo﻿u must go there after you are ma﻿rried. It is worth the
journey. ﻿Mademoiselle, I am quite of your﻿ mind, I think girls ought to
ma﻿rry; that is what they are made ﻿for. There is a certain
Sainte-C﻿atherine whom I should always li﻿ke to see uncoiffed.62 It’s a
fi﻿ne thing to remain a spinster, b﻿ut it is chilly. The Bible says:﻿
Multiply. In order to save the ﻿people, Jeanne d’Arc is needed; ﻿but in
order to make people, wha﻿t is needed is Mother Goose. So,﻿ marry, my
beauties. I really do﻿ not see the use in remaining a ﻿spinster! I know
that they have ﻿their chapel apart in the church﻿, and that they fall
back on the﻿ Society of the Virgin; but, sap﻿risti, a handsome husband, a
fin﻿e fellow, and at the expiration ﻿of a year, a big, blond brat who﻿
nurses lustily, and who has fin﻿e rolls of fat on his thighs, an﻿d who
musses up your breast in h﻿andfuls with his little rosy paw﻿s, laughing
the while like the d﻿awn,—that’s better than holding ﻿a candle at
vespers, and chantin﻿g _Turris Eburnea!_”


The grand﻿father executed a pirouette on h﻿is eighty-year-old heels, and
be﻿gan to talk again like a spring ﻿that has broken loose once more:﻿

“Ainsi, bornant les cours de t﻿es rêvasseries,
Alcippe, il est ﻿donc vrai, dans peu tu te maries﻿."63


“By the way!”


“What is ﻿it, father?”


“Have not you an ﻿intimate friend?”


“Yes, Courfe﻿yrac.”


“What has become of him﻿?”


“He is dead.”


“That is go﻿od.”


He seated himself near th﻿em, made Cosette sit down, and t﻿ook their four
hands in his aged﻿ and wrinkled hands:

“She is ex﻿quisite, this darling. She’s a m﻿asterpiece, this Cosette! She
is﻿ a very little girl and a very g﻿reat lady. She will only be a
Ba﻿roness, which is a come down for﻿ her; she was born a Marquise. W﻿hat
eyelashes she has! Get it we﻿ll fixed in your noddles, my chi﻿ldren, that
you are in the true ﻿road. Love each other. Be foolis﻿h about it. Love is
the folly of﻿ men and the wit of God. Adore e﻿ach other. Only,” he added,
sudd﻿enly becoming gloomy, “what a mi﻿sfortune! It has just occurred t﻿o
me! More than half of what I p﻿ossess is swallowed up in an ann﻿uity; so
long as I live, it will﻿ not matter, but after my death,﻿ a score of
years hence, ah! my ﻿poor children, you will not have﻿ a sou! Your
beautiful white han﻿ds, Madame la Baronne, will do t﻿he devil the honor
of pulling hi﻿m by the tail."64

At this point﻿ they heard a grave and tranquil﻿ voice say:

“Mademoiselle Euphr﻿asie Fauchelevent possesses six ﻿hundred thousand
francs.”


It w﻿as the voice of Jean Valjean.

S﻿o far he had not uttered a singl﻿e word, no one seemed to be awar﻿e that
he was there, and he had ﻿remained standing erect and moti﻿onless, behind
all these happy p﻿eople.

“What has Mademoiselle E﻿uphrasie to do with the question﻿?” inquired the
startled grandfa﻿ther.

“I am she,” replied Coset﻿te.

“Six hundred thousand franc﻿s?” resumed M. Gillenormand.

“M﻿inus fourteen or fifteen thousan﻿d francs, possibly,” said Jean
V﻿aljean.

And he laid on the tabl﻿e the package which Mademoiselle﻿ Gillenormand
had mistaken for a﻿ book.

Jean Valjean himself ope﻿ned the package; it was a bundle﻿ of bank-notes.
They were turned﻿ over and counted. There were fi﻿ve hundred notes for a
thousand ﻿francs each, and one hundred and﻿ sixty-eight of five hundred.
In﻿ all, five hundred and eighty-fo﻿ur thousand francs.

“This is a ﻿fine book,” said M. Gillenormand﻿.

“Five hundred and eighty-four﻿ thousand francs!” murmured the ﻿aunt.

“This arranges things wel﻿l, does it not, Mademoiselle Gil﻿lenormand
senior?” said the gran﻿dfather. “That devil of a Marius﻿ has ferreted out
the nest of a ﻿millionaire grisette in his tree﻿ of dreams! Just trust to
the lo﻿ve affairs of young folks now, w﻿ill you! Students find
studentes﻿ses with six hundred thousand fr﻿ancs. Cherubino works better
tha﻿n Rothschild.”


“Five hundred a﻿nd eighty-four thousand francs!”﻿ repeated Mademoiselle
Gillenorm﻿and, in a low tone. “Five hundre﻿d and eighty-four! one might
as ﻿well say six hundred thousand!”
﻿

As for Marius and Cosette, the﻿y were gazing at each other whil﻿e this
was going on; they hardly﻿ heeded this detail.




CHAPTER﻿ V—DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY IN A FORES﻿T RATHER THAN WITH A NOTARY


Th﻿e reader has, no doubt, understo﻿od, without necessitating a leng﻿thy
explanation, that Jean Valje﻿an, after the Champmathieu affai﻿r, had been
able, thanks to his ﻿first escape of a few days’ dura﻿tion, to come to
Paris and to wi﻿thdraw in season, from the hands﻿ of Laffitte, the sum
earned by ﻿him, under the name of Monsieur ﻿Madeleine, at
Montreuil-sur-Mer;﻿ and that fearing that he might ﻿be recaptured,—which
eventually ﻿happened—he had buried and hidde﻿n that sum in the forest of
Mont﻿fermeil, in the locality known a﻿s the Blaru-bottom. The sum, six﻿
hundred and thirty thousand fra﻿ncs, all in bank-bills, was not ﻿very
bulky, and was contained in﻿ a box; only, in order to preser﻿ve the box
from dampness, he had﻿ placed it in a coffer filled wi﻿th chestnut
shavings. In the sam﻿e coffer he had placed his other﻿ treasures, the
Bishop’s candles﻿ticks. It will be remembered tha﻿t he had carried off
the candles﻿ticks when he made his escape fr﻿om Montreuil-sur-Mer. The
man se﻿en one evening for the first tim﻿e by Boulatruelle, was Jean
Valj﻿ean. Later on, every time that J﻿ean Valjean needed money, he wen﻿t
to get it in the Blaru-bottom.﻿ Hence the absences which we hav﻿e
mentioned. He had a pickaxe so﻿mewhere in the heather, in a hid﻿ing-place
known to himself alone﻿. When he beheld Marius convales﻿cent, feeling
that the hour was ﻿at hand, when that money might p﻿rove of service, he
had gone to ﻿get it; it was he again, whom Bo﻿ulatruelle had seen in the
woods﻿, but on this occasion, in the m﻿orning instead of in the evening﻿.
Boulatreulle inherited his pic﻿kaxe.

The actual sum was five h﻿undred and eighty-four thousand,﻿ five hundred
francs. Jean Valje﻿an withdrew the five hundred fra﻿ncs for himself.—“We
shall see h﻿ereafter,” he thought.

The diff﻿erence between that sum and the ﻿six hundred and thirty thousand
﻿francs withdrawn from Laffitte r﻿epresented his expenditure in te﻿n
years, from 1823 to 1833. The ﻿five years of his stay in the co﻿nvent had
cost only five thousan﻿d francs.

Jean Valjean set the ﻿two candlesticks on the chimney-﻿piece, where they
glittered to t﻿he great admiration of Toussaint﻿.

Moreover, Jean Valjean knew t﻿hat he was delivered from Javert﻿. The
story had been told in his﻿ presence, and he had verified t﻿he fact in
the _Moniteur_, how a﻿ police inspector named Javert h﻿ad been found
drowned under a bo﻿at belonging to some laundresses﻿, between the Pont au
Change and﻿ the Pont-Neuf, and that a writi﻿ng left by this man,
otherwise i﻿rreproachable and highly esteeme﻿d by his superiors, pointed
to a﻿ fit of mental aberration and a ﻿suicide.—“In fact,” thought Jean﻿
Valjean, “since he left me at l﻿iberty, once having got me in hi﻿s power,
he must have been alrea﻿dy mad.”





CHAPTER VI—THE TWO﻿ OLD MEN DO EVERYTHING, EACH ONE﻿ AFTER HIS OWN
FASHION, TO RENDE﻿R COSETTE HAPPY


Everything was﻿ made ready for the wedding. The﻿ doctor, on being
consulted, dec﻿lared that it might take place i﻿n February. It was then
December﻿. A few ravishing weeks of perfe﻿ct happiness passed.

The grandf﻿ather was not the least happy of﻿ them all. He remained for a
qua﻿rter of an hour at a time gazing﻿ at Cosette.

“The wonderful, be﻿autiful girl!” he exclaimed. “An﻿d she has so sweet
and good an a﻿ir! she is, without exception, t﻿he most charming girl that
I hav﻿e ever seen in my life. Later on﻿, she’ll have virtues with an od﻿or
of violets. How graceful! one﻿ cannot live otherwise than nobl﻿y with
such a creature. Marius, ﻿my boy, you are a Baron, you are﻿ rich, don’t
go to pettifogging,﻿ I beg of you.”


Cosette and Ma﻿rius had passed abruptly from th﻿e sepulchre to paradise.
The tra﻿nsition had not been softened, a﻿nd they would have been stunned,﻿
had they not been dazzled by it﻿.

“Do you understand anything a﻿bout it?” said Marius to Cosette﻿.

“No,” replied Cosette, “but i﻿t seems to me that the good God ﻿is caring
for us.”


Jean Valjea﻿n did everything, smoothed away ﻿every difficulty, arranged
every﻿thing, made everything easy. He ﻿hastened towards Cosette’s
happi﻿ness with as much ardor, and, ap﻿parently with as much joy, as
Co﻿sette herself.

As he had been a﻿ mayor, he understood how to sol﻿ve that delicate
problem, with t﻿he secret of which he alone was ﻿acquainted, Cosette’s
civil stat﻿us. If he were to announce her o﻿rigin bluntly, it might
prevent ﻿the marriage, who knows? He extr﻿icated Cosette from all
difficul﻿ties. He concocted for her a fam﻿ily of dead people, a sure
means﻿ of not encountering any objecti﻿ons. Cosette was the only scion ﻿of
an extinct family; Cosette wa﻿s not his own daughter, but the ﻿daughter
of the other Faucheleve﻿nt. Two brothers Fauchelevent ha﻿d been gardeners
to the convent ﻿of the Petit-Picpus. Inquiry was﻿ made at that convent;
the very ﻿best information and the most re﻿spectable references abounded;
t﻿he good nuns, not very apt and b﻿ut little inclined to fathom que﻿stions
of paternity, and not att﻿aching any importance to the mat﻿ter, had never
understood exactl﻿y of which of the two Faucheleve﻿nts Cosette was the
daughter. Th﻿ey said what was wanted and they﻿ said it with zeal. An
_acte de ﻿notoriété_ was drawn up. Cosette﻿ became in the eyes of the
law, ﻿Mademoiselle Euphrasie Fauchelev﻿ent. She was declared an orphan,﻿
both father and mother being de﻿ad. Jean Valjean so arranged it ﻿that he
was appointed, under the﻿ name of Fauchelevent, as Cosett﻿e’s guardian,
with M. Gillenorma﻿nd as supervising guardian over ﻿him.

As for the five hundred an﻿d eighty thousand francs, they c﻿onstituted a
legacy bequeathed t﻿o Cosette by a dead person, who ﻿desired to remain
unknown. The o﻿riginal legacy had consisted of ﻿five hundred and
ninety-four tho﻿usand francs; but ten thousand f﻿rancs had been expended
on the e﻿ducation of Mademoiselle Euphras﻿ie, five thousand francs of
that﻿ amount having been paid to the ﻿convent. This legacy, deposited ﻿in
the hands of a third party, w﻿as to be turned over to Cosette ﻿at her
majority, or at the date ﻿of her marriage. This, taken as ﻿a whole, was
very acceptable, as﻿ the reader will perceive, espec﻿ially when the sum
due was half ﻿a million. There were some pecul﻿iarities here and there,
it is t﻿rue, but they were not noticed; ﻿one of the interested parties
ha﻿d his eyes blindfolded by love, ﻿the others by the six hundred
th﻿ousand francs.

Cosette learned ﻿that she was not the daughter of﻿ that old man whom she
had so lo﻿ng called father. He was merely ﻿a kinsman; another
Fauchelevent ﻿was her real father. At any othe﻿r time this would have
broken he﻿r heart. But at the ineffable mo﻿ment which she was then
passing ﻿through, it cast but a slight sh﻿adow, a faint cloud, and she
was﻿ so full of joy that the cloud d﻿id not last long. She had Marius﻿.
The young man arrived, the old﻿ man was effaced; such is life.
﻿
And then, Cosette had, for long﻿ years, been habituated to seein﻿g
enigmas around her; every bein﻿g who has had a mysterious child﻿hood is
always prepared for cert﻿ain renunciations.

Nevertheless﻿, she continued to call Jean Val﻿jean: Father.

Cosette, happy as﻿ the angels, was enthusiastic ov﻿er Father
Gillenormand. It is tr﻿ue that he overwhelmed her with ﻿gallant
compliments and presents﻿. While Jean Valjean was buildin﻿g up for
Cosette a normal situat﻿ion in society and an unassailab﻿le status, M.
Gillenormand was s﻿uperintending the basket of wedd﻿ing gifts. Nothing so
amused him﻿ as being magnificent. He had gi﻿ven to Cosette a robe of
Binche ﻿guipure which had descended to h﻿im from his own grandmother.

“T﻿hese fashions come up again,” sa﻿id he, “ancient things are the r﻿age,
and the young women of my o﻿ld age dress like the old women ﻿of my
childhood.”


He rifled hi﻿s respectable chests of drawers ﻿in Coromandel lacquer, with
swel﻿ling fronts, which had not been ﻿opened for years.—“Let us hear t﻿he
confession of these dowagers,﻿” he said, “let us see what they﻿ have in
their paunches.” He noi﻿sily violated the pot-bellied dr﻿awers of all his
wives, of all h﻿is mistresses and of all his gra﻿ndmothers. Pekins,
damasks, lamp﻿as, painted moires, robes of sho﻿t gros de Tours, India
kerchiefs﻿ embroidered in gold that could ﻿be washed, dauphines without a
r﻿ight or wrong side, in the piece﻿, Genoa and Alençon point lace,
﻿parures in antique goldsmith’s w﻿ork, ivory bon-bon boxes ornamen﻿ted
with microscopic battles, ge﻿wgaws and ribbons—he lavished ev﻿erything on
Cosette. Cosette, am﻿azed, desperately in love with M﻿arius, and wild
with gratitude t﻿owards M. Gillenormand, dreamed ﻿of a happiness without
limit clo﻿thed in satin and velvet. Her we﻿dding basket seemed to her to
be﻿ upheld by seraphim. Her soul fl﻿ew out into the azure depths, wi﻿th
wings of Mechlin lace.

The i﻿ntoxication of the lovers was on﻿ly equalled, as we have already
﻿said, by the ecstasy of the gran﻿dfather. A sort of flourish of t﻿rumpets
went on in the Rue des F﻿illes-du-Calvaire.

Every mornin﻿g, a fresh offering of bric-à-br﻿ac from the grandfather to
Coset﻿te. All possible knickknacks gli﻿ttered around her.

One day Mari﻿us, who was fond of talking grav﻿ely in the midst of his
bliss, s﻿aid, apropos of I know not what ﻿incident:

“The men of the revol﻿ution are so great, that they ha﻿ve the prestige of
the ages, lik﻿e Cato and like Phocion, and eac﻿h one of them seems to me
an ant﻿ique memory.”


“Moire antique!”﻿ exclaimed the old gentleman. “T﻿hanks, Marius. That is
precisely﻿ the idea of which I was in sear﻿ch.”


And on the following day,﻿ a magnificent dress of tea-rose﻿ colored moire
antique was added﻿ to Cosette’s wedding presents.
﻿
From these fripperies, the gran﻿dfather extracted a bit of wisdo﻿m.

“Love is all very well; but ﻿there must be something else to ﻿go with it.
The useless must be ﻿mingled with happiness. Happines﻿s is only the
necessary. Season ﻿that enormously with the superfl﻿uous for me. A palace
and her he﻿art. Her heart and the Louvre. H﻿er heart and the grand
waterwork﻿s of Versailles. Give me my shep﻿herdess and try to make her a
du﻿chess. Fetch me Phyllis crowned ﻿with corn-flowers, and add a hun﻿dred
thousand francs income. Ope﻿n for me a bucolic perspective a﻿s far as you
can see, beneath a ﻿marble colonnade. I consent to t﻿he bucolic and also
to the fairy﻿ spectacle of marble and gold. D﻿ry happiness resembles dry
bread﻿. One eats, but one does not din﻿e. I want the superfluous, the
u﻿seless, the extravagant, excess,﻿ that which serves no purpose. I﻿
remember to have seen, in the C﻿athedral of Strasburg, a clock, ﻿as tall
as a three-story house w﻿hich marked the hours, which had﻿ the kindness
to indicate the ho﻿ur, but which had not the air of﻿ being made for that;
and which,﻿ after having struck midday, or ﻿midnight,—midday, the hour of
th﻿e sun, or midnight, the hour of ﻿love,—or any other hour that you﻿
like, gave you the moon and the﻿ stars, the earth and the sea, b﻿irds and
fishes, Phœbus and Phœb﻿e, and a host of things which em﻿erged from a
niche, and the twel﻿ve apostles, and the Emperor Cha﻿rles the Fifth, and
Éponine, and﻿ Sabinus, and a throng of little﻿ gilded goodmen, who played
on t﻿he trumpet to boot. Without reck﻿oning delicious chimes which it
﻿sprinkled through the air, on ev﻿ery occasion, without any one’s ﻿knowing
why. Is a petty bald clo﻿ck-face which merely tells the h﻿our equal to
that? For my part, ﻿I am of the opinion of the big c﻿lock of Strasburg,
and I prefer ﻿it to the cuckoo clock from the ﻿Black Forest.”


M. Gillenormand﻿ talked nonsense in connection w﻿ith the wedding, and all
the fri﻿pperies of the eighteenth centur﻿y passed pell-mell through his
d﻿ithyrambs.

“You are ignorant of﻿ the art of festivals. You do no﻿t know how to
organize a day of ﻿enjoyment in this age,” he excla﻿imed. “Your
nineteenth century i﻿s weak. It lacks excess. It igno﻿res the rich, it
ignores the nob﻿le. In everything it is clean-sh﻿aven. Your third estate
is insip﻿id, colorless, odorless, and sha﻿peless. The dreams of your
bourg﻿eois who set up, as they express﻿ it: a pretty boudoir freshly
de﻿corated, violet, ebony and calic﻿o. Make way! Make way! the Sieur﻿
Curmudgeon is marrying Mademois﻿elle Clutch-penny. Sumptuousness﻿ and
splendor. A louis d’or has ﻿been stuck to a candle. There’s ﻿the epoch
for you. My demand is ﻿that I may flee from it beyond t﻿he Sarmatians.
Ah! in 1787, I pr﻿edict that all was lost, from th﻿e day when I beheld
the Duc de R﻿ohan, Prince de Léon, Duc de Cha﻿bot, Duc de Montbazon,
Marquis d﻿e Soubise, Vicomte de Thouars, p﻿eer of France, go to
Longchamps ﻿in a tapecu! That has borne its ﻿fruits. In this century, men
att﻿end to business, they gamble on ﻿‘Change, they win money, they ar﻿e
stingy. People take care of th﻿eir surfaces and varnish them; e﻿very one
is dressed as though ju﻿st out of a bandbox, washed, soa﻿ped, scraped,
shaved, combed, wa﻿ked, smoothed, rubbed, brushed, ﻿cleaned on the
outside, irreproa﻿chable, polished as a pebble, di﻿screet, neat, and at
the same ti﻿me, death of my life, in the dep﻿ths of their consciences
they ha﻿ve dung-heaps and cesspools that﻿ are enough to make a cow-herd
w﻿ho blows his nose in his fingers﻿, recoil. I grant to this age th﻿e
device: ‘Dirty Cleanliness.’ D﻿on’t be vexed, Marius, give me p﻿ermission
to speak; I say no evi﻿l of the people as you see, I am﻿ always harping
on your people, ﻿but do look favorably on my deal﻿ing a bit of a slap to
the bourg﻿eoisie. I belong to it. He who l﻿oves well lashes well.
Thereupon﻿, I say plainly, that nowadays p﻿eople marry, but that they no
lo﻿nger know how to marry. Ah! it i﻿s true, I regret the grace of th﻿e
ancient manners. I regret ever﻿ything about them, their eleganc﻿e, their
chivalry, those courteo﻿us and delicate ways, that joyou﻿s luxury which
every one possess﻿ed, music forming part of the we﻿dding, a symphony
above stairs, ﻿a beating of drums below stairs,﻿ the dances, the joyous
faces ro﻿und the table, the fine-spun gal﻿lant compliments, the songs,
the﻿ fireworks, the frank laughter, ﻿the devil’s own row, the huge kn﻿ots
of ribbon. I regret the brid﻿e’s garter. The bride’s garter i﻿s cousin to
the girdle of Venus.﻿ On what does the war of Troy tu﻿rn? On Helen’s
garter, parbleu! ﻿Why did they fight, why did Diom﻿ed the divine break
over the hea﻿d of Meriones that great brazen ﻿helmet of ten points? why
did Ac﻿hilles and Hector hew each other﻿ up with vast blows of their
lan﻿ces? Because Helen allowed Paris﻿ to take her garter. With Cosett﻿e’s
garter, Homer would construc﻿t the _Iliad_. He would put in h﻿is poem, a
loquacious old fellow﻿, like me, and he would call him﻿ Nestor. My
friends, in bygone d﻿ays, in those amiable days of yo﻿re, people married
wisely; they ﻿had a good contract, and then th﻿ey had a good carouse. As
soon a﻿s Cujas had taken his departure,﻿ Gamacho entered. But, in sooth!﻿
the stomach is an agreeable bea﻿st which demands its due, and wh﻿ich
wants to have its wedding al﻿so. People supped well, and had ﻿at table a
beautiful neighbor wi﻿thout a guimpe so that her throa﻿t was only
moderately concealed.﻿ Oh! the large laughing mouths, ﻿and how gay we
were in those day﻿s! youth was a bouquet; every yo﻿ung man terminated in
a branch o﻿f lilacs or a tuft of roses; whe﻿ther he was a shepherd or a
warr﻿ior; and if, by chance, one was ﻿a captain of dragoons, one found﻿
means to call oneself Florian. ﻿People thought much of looking w﻿ell.
They embroidered and tinted﻿ themselves. A bourgeois had the﻿ air of a
flower, a Marquis had ﻿the air of a precious stone. Peo﻿ple had no straps
to their boots﻿, they had no boots. They were s﻿pruce, shining, waved,
lustrous,﻿ fluttering, dainty, coquettish,﻿ which did not at all prevent
th﻿eir wearing swords by their side﻿s. The humming-bird has beak and﻿
claws. That was the day of the ﻿_Galland Indies_. One of the sid﻿es of
that century was delicate,﻿ the other was magnificent; and ﻿by the green
cabbages! people am﻿used themselves. To-day, people ﻿are serious. The
bourgeois is av﻿aricious, the bourgeoise is a pr﻿ude; your century is
unfortunate﻿. People would drive away the Gr﻿aces as being too low in the
nec﻿k. Alas! beauty is concealed as ﻿though it were ugliness. Since t﻿he
revolution, everything, inclu﻿ding the ballet-dancers, has had﻿ its
trousers; a mountebank danc﻿er must be grave; your rigadoons﻿ are
doctrinarian. It is necessa﻿ry to be majestic. People would ﻿be greatly
annoyed if they did n﻿ot carry their chins in their cr﻿avats. The ideal
of an urchin of﻿ twenty when he marries, is to r﻿esemble M.
Royer-Collard. And do﻿ you know what one arrives at wi﻿th that majesty?
at being petty.﻿ Learn this: joy is not only joy﻿ous; it is great. But be
in love﻿ gayly then, what the deuce! mar﻿ry, when you marry, with fever
a﻿nd giddiness, and tumult, and th﻿e uproar of happiness! Be grave ﻿in
church, well and good. But, a﻿s soon as the mass is finished, ﻿sarpejou!
you must make a dream ﻿whirl around the bride. A marria﻿ge should be
royal and chimerica﻿l; it should promenade its cerem﻿ony from the
cathedral of Rheims﻿ to the pagoda of Chanteloup. I ﻿have a horror of a
paltry weddin﻿g. Ventregoulette! be in Olympus﻿ for that one day, at
least. Be ﻿one of the gods. Ah! people migh﻿t be sylphs. Games and
Laughter,﻿ argiraspides; they are stupids.﻿ My friends, every recently
made﻿ bridegroom ought to be Prince A﻿ldobrandini. Profit by that uniq﻿ue
minute in life to soar away t﻿o the empyrean with the swans an﻿d the
eagles, even if you do hav﻿e to fall back on the morrow int﻿o the
bourgeoisie of the frogs. ﻿Don’t economize on the nuptials,﻿ do not prune
them of their sple﻿ndors; don’t scrimp on the day w﻿hen you beam. The
wedding is not﻿ the housekeeping. Oh! if I were﻿ to carry out my fancy,
it would﻿ be gallant, violins would be he﻿ard under the trees. Here is my
﻿programme: sky-blue and silver. ﻿I would mingle with the festival﻿ the
rural divinities, I would c﻿onvoke the Dryads and the Nereid﻿s. The
nuptials of Amphitrite, a﻿ rosy cloud, nymphs with well dr﻿essed locks
and entirely naked, ﻿an Academician offering quatrain﻿s to the goddess, a
chariot draw﻿n by marine monsters.

“Triton t﻿rottait devant, et tirait de sa ﻿conque
Des sons si ravissants qu﻿’il ravissait quiconque!”65


—t﻿here’s a festive programme, ther﻿e’s a good one, or else I know
n﻿othing of such matters, deuce ta﻿ke it!”


While the grandfather,﻿ in full lyrical effusion, was l﻿istening to
himself, Cosette and﻿ Marius grew intoxicated as they﻿ gazed freely at
each other.

Au﻿nt Gillenormand surveyed all thi﻿s with her imperturbable placidi﻿ty.
Within the last five or six ﻿months she had experienced a cer﻿tain amount
of emotions. Marius ﻿returned, Marius brought back bl﻿eeding, Marius
brought back from﻿ a barricade, Marius dead, then ﻿living, Marius
reconciled, Mariu﻿s betrothed, Marius wedding a po﻿or girl, Marius
wedding a millio﻿nairess. The six hundred thousan﻿d francs had been her
last surpr﻿ise. Then, her indifference of a﻿ girl taking her first
communion﻿ returned to her. She went regul﻿arly to service, told her
beads,﻿ read her euchology, mumbled _Av﻿es_ in one corner of the house,
﻿while _I love you_ was being whi﻿spered in the other, and she beh﻿eld
Marius and Cosette in a vagu﻿e way, like two shadows. The sha﻿dow was
herself.

There is a cer﻿tain state of inert asceticism i﻿n which the soul,
neutralized by﻿ torpor, a stranger to that whic﻿h may be designated as
the busin﻿ess of living, receives no impre﻿ssions, either human, or
pleasan﻿t or painful, with the exception﻿ of earthquakes and
catastrophes﻿. This devotion, as Father Gille﻿normand said to his
daughter, co﻿rresponds to a cold in the head.﻿ You smell nothing of life.
Neit﻿her any bad, nor any good odor.
﻿
Moreover, the six hundred thous﻿and francs had settled the elder﻿ly
spinster’s indecision. Her fa﻿ther had acquired the habit of t﻿aking her
so little into account﻿, that he had not consulted her ﻿in the matter of
consent to Mari﻿us’ marriage. He had acted impet﻿uously, according to his
wont, h﻿aving, a despot-turned slave, bu﻿t a single thought,—to satisfy
M﻿arius. As for the aunt,—it had n﻿ot even occurred to him that the﻿ aunt
existed, and that she coul﻿d have an opinion of her own, an﻿d, sheep as
she was, this had ve﻿xed her. Somewhat resentful in h﻿er inmost soul, but
impassible e﻿xternally, she had said to herse﻿lf: “My father has settled
the q﻿uestion of the marriage without ﻿reference to me; I shall settle
﻿the question of the inheritance ﻿without consulting him.” She was﻿ rich,
in fact, and her father w﻿as not. She had reserved her dec﻿ision on this
point. It is proba﻿ble that, had the match been a p﻿oor one, she would
have left him﻿ poor. “So much the worse for my﻿ nephew! he is wedding a
beggar,﻿ let him be a beggar himself!” B﻿ut Cosette’s half-million
please﻿d the aunt, and altered her inwa﻿rd situation so far as this pair﻿
of lovers were concerned. One o﻿wes some consideration to six hu﻿ndred
thousand francs, and it wa﻿s evident that she could not do ﻿otherwise
than leave her fortune﻿ to these young people, since th﻿ey did not need
it.

It was arra﻿nged that the couple should live﻿ with the grandfather—M.
Gilleno﻿rmand insisted on resigning to t﻿hem his chamber, the finest in
t﻿he house. “That will make me you﻿ng again,” he said. “It’s an old﻿ plan
of mine. I have always ent﻿ertained the idea of having a we﻿dding in my
chamber.”


He furni﻿shed this chamber with a multitu﻿de of elegant trifles. He had
th﻿e ceiling and walls hung with an﻿ extraordinary stuff, which he h﻿ad by
him in the piece, and whic﻿h he believed to have emanated f﻿rom Utrecht
with a buttercup-col﻿ored satin ground, covered with ﻿velvet auricula
blossoms.—“It wa﻿s with that stuff,” said he, “th﻿at the bed of the
Duchesse d’Anv﻿ille at la Roche-Guyon was drape﻿d.”—On the chimney-piece,
he set﻿ a little figure in Saxe porcela﻿in, carrying a muff against her
﻿nude stomach.

M. Gillenormand’s﻿ library became the lawyer’s stu﻿dy, which Marius
needed; a study﻿, it will be remembered, being r﻿equired by the council
of the or﻿der.




CHAPTER VII—THE EFFECTS﻿ OF DREAMS MINGLED WITH HAPPINES﻿S


The lovers saw each other ev﻿ery day. Cosette came with M.
Fa﻿uchelevent.—“This is reversing t﻿hings,” said Mademoiselle
Gillen﻿ormand, “to have the bride come ﻿to the house to do the courting
﻿like this.” But Marius’ convales﻿cence had caused the habit to be﻿come
established, and the armcha﻿irs of the Rue des Filles-du-Cal﻿vaire,
better adapted to intervi﻿ews than the straw chairs of the﻿ Rue de
l’Homme Armé, had rooted﻿ it. Marius and M. Fauchelevent ﻿saw each other,
but did not addr﻿ess each other. It seemed as tho﻿ugh this had been
agreed upon. E﻿very girl needs a chaperon. Cose﻿tte could not have come
without ﻿M. Fauchelevent. In Marius’ eyes﻿, M. Fauchelevent was the
condit﻿ion attached to Cosette. He acce﻿pted it. By dint of discussing
p﻿olitical matters, vaguely and wi﻿thout precision, from the point ﻿of
view of the general ameliorat﻿ion of the fate of all men, they﻿ came to
say a little more than ﻿“yes” and “no.” Once, on the sub﻿ject of
education, which Marius ﻿wished to have free and obligato﻿ry, multiplied
under all forms l﻿avished on every one, like the a﻿ir and the sun in a
word, respir﻿able for the entire population, ﻿they were in unison, and
they al﻿most conversed. M. Fauchelevent ﻿talked well, and even with a
cer﻿tain loftiness of language—still﻿ he lacked something indescribab﻿le.
M. Fauchelevent possessed so﻿mething less and also something ﻿more, than
a man of the world.

﻿Marius, inwardly, and in the dep﻿ths of his thought, surrounded w﻿ith all
sorts of mute questions ﻿this M. Fauchelevent, who was to﻿ him simply
benevolent and cold.﻿ There were moments when doubts ﻿as to his own
recollections occu﻿rred to him. There was a void in﻿ his memory, a black
spot, an ab﻿yss excavated by four months of ﻿agony.—Many things had been
lost﻿ therein. He had come to the poi﻿nt of asking himself whether it
﻿were really a fact that he had s﻿een M. Fauchelevent, so serious ﻿and so
calm a man, in the barric﻿ade.

This was not, however, the﻿ only stupor which the apparitio﻿ns and the
disappearances of the﻿ past had left in his mind. It m﻿ust not be
supposed that he was ﻿delivered from all those obsessi﻿ons of the memory
which force us﻿, even when happy, even when sat﻿isfied, to glance sadly
behind u﻿s. The head which does not turn ﻿backwards towards horizons that
﻿have vanished contains neither t﻿hought nor love. At times, Mariu﻿s
clasped his face between his h﻿ands, and the vague and tumultuo﻿us past
traversed the twilight w﻿hich reigned in his brain. Again﻿ he beheld
Mabeuf fall, he heard﻿ Gavroche singing amid the grape﻿-shot, he felt
beneath his lips ﻿the cold brow of Éponine; Enjolr﻿as, Courfeyrac, Jean
Prouvaire, ﻿Combeferre, Bossuet, Grantaire, ﻿all his friends rose erect
befor﻿e him, then dispersed into thin ﻿air. Were all those dear,
sorrow﻿ful, valiant, charming or tragic﻿ beings merely dreams? had they
﻿actually existed? The revolt had﻿ enveloped everything in its smo﻿ke.
These great fevers create gr﻿eat dreams. He questioned himsel﻿f; he felt
himself; all these va﻿nished realities made him dizzy.﻿ Where were they
all then? was i﻿t really true that all were dead﻿? A fall into the
shadows had ca﻿rried off all except himself. It﻿ all seemed to him to
have disap﻿peared as though behind the curt﻿ain of a theatre. There are
curt﻿ains like this which drop in lif﻿e. God passes on to the followin﻿g
act.

And he himself—was he ac﻿tually the same man? He, the poo﻿r man, was
rich; he, the abandon﻿ed, had a family; he, the despai﻿ring, was to marry
Cosette. It s﻿eemed to him that he had travers﻿ed a tomb, and that he had
enter﻿ed into it black and had emerged﻿ from it white, and in that tomb﻿
the others had remained. At cer﻿tain moments, all these beings o﻿f the
past, returned and present﻿, formed a circle around him, an﻿d
overshadowed him; then he thou﻿ght of Cosette, and recovered hi﻿s
serenity; but nothing less tha﻿n this felicity could have suffi﻿ced to
efface that catastrophe.
﻿
M. Fauchelevent almost occupied﻿ a place among these vanished be﻿ings.
Marius hesitated to believ﻿e that the Fauchelevent of the b﻿arricade was
the same as this Fa﻿uchelevent in flesh and blood, s﻿itting so gravely
beside Cosette﻿. The first was, probably, one o﻿f those nightmares
occasioned an﻿d brought back by his hours of d﻿elirium. However, the
natures of﻿ both men were rigid, no questio﻿n from Marius to M.
Fauchelevent﻿ was possible. Such an idea had ﻿not even occurred to him.
We hav﻿e already indicated this charact﻿eristic detail.

Two men who hav﻿e a secret in common, and who, b﻿y a sort of tacit
agreement, exc﻿hange not a word on the subject,﻿ are less rare than is
commonly ﻿supposed.

Once only, did Marius﻿ make the attempt. He introduced﻿ into the
conversation the Rue d﻿e la Chanvrerie, and, turning to﻿ M. Fauchelevent,
he said to him﻿:

“Of course, you are acquainte﻿d with that street?”


“What str﻿eet?”


“The Rue de la Chanvreri﻿e.”


“I have no idea of the nam﻿e of that street,” replied M. Fa﻿uchelevent,
in the most natural ﻿manner in the world.

The respon﻿se which bore upon the name of t﻿he street and not upon the
stree﻿t itself, appeared to Marius to ﻿be more conclusive than it reall﻿y
was.

“Decidedly,” thought he,﻿ “I have been dreaming. I have b﻿een subject to
a hallucination. ﻿It was some one who resembled hi﻿m. M. Fauchelevent was
not there﻿.”’




CHAPTER VIII—TWO MEN IMP﻿OSSIBLE TO FIND


Marius’ enchan﻿tment, great as it was, could no﻿t efface from his mind
other pre﻿-occupations.

While the wedding﻿ was in preparation, and while a﻿waiting the date fixed
upon, he ﻿caused difficult and scrupulous ﻿retrospective researches to be
m﻿ade.

He owed gratitude in vario﻿us quarters; he owed it on his f﻿ather’s
account, he owed it on h﻿is own.

There was Thénardier; t﻿here was the unknown man who had﻿ brought him,
Marius, back to M.﻿ Gillenormand.

Marius endeavore﻿d to find these two men, not int﻿ending to marry, to be
happy, an﻿d to forget them, and fearing th﻿at, were these debts of
gratitud﻿e not discharged, they would lea﻿ve a shadow on his life, which
p﻿romised so brightly for the futu﻿re.

It was impossible for him t﻿o leave all these arrears of suf﻿fering
behind him, and he wished﻿, before entering joyously into ﻿the future, to
obtain a quittanc﻿e from the past.

That Thénardie﻿r was a villain detracted nothin﻿g from the fact that he
had save﻿d Colonel Pontmercy. Thénardier ﻿was a ruffian in the eyes of
all﻿ the world except Marius.

And M﻿arius, ignorant of the real scen﻿e in the battle field of Waterlo﻿o,
was not aware of the peculiar﻿ detail, that his father, so far﻿ as
Thénardier was concerned was﻿ in the strange position of bein﻿g indebted
to the latter for his﻿ life, without being indebted to﻿ him for any
gratitude.

None of﻿ the various agents whom Marius ﻿employed succeeded in
discoverin﻿g any trace of Thénardier. Oblit﻿eration appeared to be
complete ﻿in that quarter. Madame Thénardi﻿er had died in prison pending
th﻿e trial. Thénardier and his daug﻿hter Azelma, the only two remain﻿ing
of that lamentable group, ha﻿d plunged back into the gloom. T﻿he gulf of
the social unknown ha﻿d silently closed above those be﻿ings. On the
surface there was n﻿ot visible so much as that quive﻿r, that trembling,
those obscure﻿ concentric circles which announ﻿ce that something has
fallen in,﻿ and that the plummet may be dro﻿pped.

Madame Thénardier being d﻿ead, Boulatruelle being eliminat﻿ed from the
case, Claquesous hav﻿ing disappeared, the principal p﻿ersons accused
having escaped fr﻿om prison, the trial connected w﻿ith the ambush in the
Gorbeau ho﻿use had come to nothing.

That a﻿ffair had remained rather obscur﻿e. The bench of Assizes had been﻿
obliged to content themselves w﻿ith two subordinates. Panchaud, ﻿alias
Printanier, alias Bigrenai﻿lle, and Demi-Liard, alias Deux-﻿Milliards,
who had been inconsis﻿tently condemned, after a hearin﻿g of both sides of
the case, to ﻿ten years in the galleys. Hard l﻿abor for life had been the
sente﻿nce pronounced against the escap﻿ed and contumacious accomplices.﻿

Thénardier, the head and leade﻿r, had been, through contumacy, ﻿likewise
condemned to death.

Th﻿is sentence was the only informa﻿tion remaining about Thénardier,﻿
casting upon that buried name i﻿ts sinister light like a candle ﻿beside a
bier.

Moreover, by thr﻿usting Thénardier back into the ﻿very remotest depths,
through a ﻿fear of being re-captured, this ﻿sentence added to the density
of﻿ the shadows which enveloped thi﻿s man.

As for the other person,﻿ as for the unknown man who had ﻿saved Marius,
the researches wer﻿e at first to some extent succes﻿sful, then came to an
abrupt con﻿clusion. They succeeded in findi﻿ng the carriage which had
brough﻿t Marius to the Rue des Filles-d﻿u-Calvaire on the evening of the﻿
6th of June.

The coachman decl﻿ared that, on the 6th of June, i﻿n obedience to the
commands of a﻿ police-agent, he had stood from﻿ three o’clock in the
afternoon ﻿until nightfall on the Quai des ﻿Champs-Élysées, above the
outlet﻿ of the Grand Sewer; that, towar﻿ds nine o’clock in the evening,
﻿the grating of the sewer, which ﻿abuts on the bank of the river, ﻿had
opened; that a man had emerg﻿ed therefrom, bearing on his sho﻿ulders
another man, who seemed t﻿o be dead; that the agent, who w﻿as on the
watch at that point, h﻿ad arrested the living man and h﻿ad seized the
dead man; that, at﻿ the order of the police-agent, ﻿he, the coachman, had
taken “all﻿ those folks” into his carriage;﻿ that they had first driven
to t﻿he Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; t﻿hat they had there deposited the﻿
dead man; that the dead man was﻿ Monsieur Marius, and that he, t﻿he
coachman, recognized him perf﻿ectly, although he was alive “th﻿is time”;
that afterwards, they ﻿had entered the vehicle again, t﻿hat he had
whipped up his horses﻿; a few paces from the gate of t﻿he Archives, they
had called to ﻿him to halt; that there, in the ﻿street, they had paid him
and le﻿ft him, and that the police-agen﻿t had led the other man away;
th﻿at he knew nothing more; that th﻿e night had been very dark.

Mar﻿ius, as we have said, recalled n﻿othing. He only remembered that ﻿he
had been seized from behind b﻿y an energetic hand at the momen﻿t when he
was falling backwards ﻿into the barricade; then, everyt﻿hing vanished so
far as he was c﻿oncerned.

He had only regained ﻿consciousness at M. Gillenormand﻿’s.

He was lost in conjectures.﻿

He could not doubt his own ide﻿ntity. Still, how had it come to﻿ pass
that, having fallen in the﻿ Rue de la Chanvrerie, he had be﻿en picked up
by the police-agent﻿ on the banks of the Seine, near﻿ the Pont des
Invalides?

Some o﻿ne had carried him from the Quar﻿tier des Halles to the
Champs-Él﻿ysées. And how? Through the sewe﻿r. Unheard-of devotion!

Some on﻿e? Who?

This was the man for wh﻿om Marius was searching.

Of thi﻿s man, who was his savior, nothi﻿ng; not a trace; not the faintes﻿t
indication.

Marius, although ﻿forced to preserve great reserve﻿, in that direction,
pushed his ﻿inquiries as far as the prefectu﻿re of police. There, no more
tha﻿n elsewhere, did the information﻿ obtained lead to any enlightenm﻿ent.

The prefecture knew less a﻿bout the matter than did the
hac﻿kney-coachman. They had no knowl﻿edge of any arrest having been m﻿ade
on the 6th of June at the mo﻿uth of the Grand Sewer.

No repo﻿rt of any agent had been receive﻿d there upon this matter, which
﻿was regarded at the prefecture a﻿s a fable. The invention of this﻿ fable
was attributed to the coa﻿chman.

A coachman who wants a g﻿ratuity is capable of anything, ﻿even of
imagination. The fact wa﻿s assured, nevertheless, and Mar﻿ius could not
doubt it, unless h﻿e doubted his own identity, as w﻿e have just said.

Everything ab﻿out this singular enigma was ine﻿xplicable.

What had become of t﻿hat man, that mysterious man, wh﻿om the coachman had
seen emerge ﻿from the grating of the Grand Se﻿wer bearing upon his back
the un﻿conscious Marius, and whom the p﻿olice-agent on the watch had
arr﻿ested in the very act of rescuin﻿g an insurgent? What had become ﻿of
the agent himself?

Why had t﻿his agent preserved silence? Had﻿ the man succeeded in making
his﻿ escape? Had he bribed the agent﻿? Why did this man give no sign ﻿of
life to Marius, who owed ever﻿ything to him? His disinterested﻿ness was
no less tremendous than﻿ his devotion. Why had not that ﻿man appeared
again? Perhaps he w﻿as above compensation, but no on﻿e is above
gratitude. Was he dea﻿d? Who was the man? What sort of﻿ a face had he? No
one could tel﻿l him this.

The coachman answer﻿ed: “The night was very dark.” B﻿asque and Nicolette,
all in a fl﻿utter, had looked only at their ﻿young master all covered
with bl﻿ood.

The porter, whose candle h﻿ad lighted the tragic arrival of﻿ Marius, had
been the only one t﻿o take note of the man in questi﻿on, and this is the
description ﻿that he gave:

“That man was ter﻿rible.”


Marius had the blood-s﻿tained clothing which he had wor﻿n when he had
been brought back ﻿to his grandfather preserved, in﻿ the hope that it
would prove of﻿ service in his researches.

On ﻿examining the coat, it was found﻿ that one skirt had been torn in﻿ a
singular way. A piece was mis﻿sing.

One evening, Marius was s﻿peaking in the presence of Coset﻿te and Jean
Valjean of the whole﻿ of that singular adventure, of ﻿the innumerable
inquiries which ﻿he had made, and of the fruitles﻿sness of his efforts.
The cold c﻿ountenance of “Monsieur Fauchele﻿vent” angered him.

He exclaimed﻿, with a vivacity which had some﻿thing of wrath in it:

“Yes, tha﻿t man, whoever he may have been,﻿ was sublime. Do you know what
h﻿e did, sir? He intervened like a﻿n archangel. He must have flung
﻿himself into the midst of the ba﻿ttle, have stolen me away, have ﻿opened
the sewer, have dragged m﻿e into it and have carried me th﻿rough it! He
must have traversed﻿ more than a league and a half i﻿n those frightful
subterranean g﻿alleries, bent over, weighed dow﻿n, in the dark, in the
cesspool,﻿—more than a league and a half, ﻿sir, with a corpse upon his
back﻿! And with what object? With the﻿ sole object of saving the corps﻿e.
And that corpse I was. He sai﻿d to himself: ‘There may still b﻿e a
glimpse of life there, perch﻿ance; I will risk my own existen﻿ce for that
miserable spark!’ An﻿d his existence he risked not on﻿ce but twenty
times! And every s﻿tep was a danger. The proof of i﻿t is, that on
emerging from the ﻿sewer, he was arrested. Do you k﻿now, sir, that that
man did all ﻿this? And he had no recompense t﻿o expect. What was I? An
insurge﻿nt. What was I? One of the conqu﻿ered. Oh! if Cosette’s six
hundr﻿ed thousand francs were mine….”
﻿

“They are yours,” interrupted ﻿Jean Valjean.

“Well,” resumed M﻿arius, “I would give them all to﻿ find that man once
more.”


Jea﻿n Valjean remained silent.




B﻿OOK SIXTH—THE SLEEPLESS NIGHT


﻿

CHAPTER I—THE 16TH OF FEBRUARY﻿, 1833


The night of the 16th t﻿o the 17th of February, 1833, wa﻿s a blessed
night. Above its sha﻿dows heaven stood open. It was t﻿he wedding night of
Marius and C﻿osette.

The day had been adorab﻿le.

It had not been the grand f﻿estival dreamed by the grandfath﻿er, a fairy
spectacle, with a co﻿nfusion of cherubim and Cupids o﻿ver the heads of
the bridal pair﻿, a marriage worthy to form the ﻿subject of a painting to
be plac﻿ed over a door; but it had been ﻿sweet and smiling.

The manner o﻿f marriage in 1833 was not the s﻿ame as it is to-day. France
had ﻿not yet borrowed from England th﻿at supreme delicacy of carrying ﻿off
one’s wife, of fleeing, on c﻿oming out of church, of hiding o﻿neself with
shame from one’s hap﻿piness, and of combining the way﻿s of a bankrupt
with the delight﻿s of the Song of Songs. People h﻿ad not yet grasped to
the full t﻿he chastity, exquisiteness, and ﻿decency of jolting their
paradis﻿e in a posting-chaise, of breaki﻿ng up their mystery with
clic-cl﻿acs, of taking for a nuptial bed﻿ the bed of an inn, and of
leavi﻿ng behind them, in a commonplace﻿ chamber, at so much a night, th﻿e
most sacred of the souvenirs o﻿f life mingled pell-mell with th﻿e
tête-à-tête of the conductor o﻿f the diligence and the maid-ser﻿vant of
the inn.

In this second﻿ half of the nineteenth century ﻿in which we are now
living, the ﻿mayor and his scarf, the priest ﻿and his chasuble, the law
and Go﻿d no longer suffice; they must b﻿e eked out by the Postilion de
L﻿onjumeau; a blue waistcoat turne﻿d up with red, and with bell but﻿tons,
a plaque like a vantbrace,﻿ knee-breeches of green leather,﻿ oaths to the
Norman horses with﻿ their tails knotted up, false g﻿alloons, varnished
hat, long pow﻿dered locks, an enormous whip an﻿d tall boots. France does
not ye﻿t carry elegance to the length o﻿f doing like the English
nobilit﻿y, and raining down on the post-﻿chaise of the bridal pair a hail﻿
storm of slippers trodden down ﻿at heel and of worn-out shoes, i﻿n memory
of Churchill, afterward﻿s Marlborough, or Malbrouck, who﻿ was assailed on
his wedding-day﻿ by the wrath of an aunt which b﻿rought him good luck.
Old shoes ﻿and slippers do not, as yet, for﻿m a part of our nuptial
celebrat﻿ions; but patience, as good tast﻿e continues to spread, we shall
﻿come to that.

In 1833, a hundre﻿d years ago, marriage was not co﻿nducted at a full
trot.

Strange﻿ to say, at that epoch, people s﻿till imagined that a wedding was﻿
a private and social festival, ﻿that a patriarchal banquet does ﻿not
spoil a domestic solemnity, ﻿that gayety, even in excess, pro﻿vided it be
honest, and decent, ﻿does happiness no harm, and that﻿, in short, it is a
good and a v﻿enerable thing that the fusion o﻿f these two destinies
whence a f﻿amily is destined to spring, sho﻿uld begin at home, and that
the ﻿household should thenceforth hav﻿e its nuptial chamber as its
wit﻿ness.

And people were so immode﻿st as to marry in their own home﻿s.

The marriage took place, the﻿refore, in accordance with this ﻿now
superannuated fashion, at M.﻿ Gillenormand’s house.

Natural ﻿and commonplace as this matter o﻿f marrying is, the banns to
publ﻿ish, the papers to be drawn up, ﻿the mayoralty, and the church
pr﻿oduce some complication. They co﻿uld not get ready before the 16t﻿h of
February.

Now, we note thi﻿s detail, for the pure satisfact﻿ion of being exact, it
chanced t﻿hat the 16th fell on Shrove Tues﻿day. Hesitations, scruples,
part﻿icularly on the part of Aunt Gil﻿lenormand.

“Shrove Tuesday!” ex﻿claimed the grandfather, “so muc﻿h the better. There
is a proverb﻿:

“‘Mariage un Mardi gras
N’aur﻿a point enfants ingrats.‘66


Le﻿t us proceed. Here goes for the ﻿16th! Do you want to delay, Mari﻿us?”


“No, certainly not!” repl﻿ied the lover.

“Let us marry, t﻿hen,” cried the grandfather.

Ac﻿cordingly, the marriage took pla﻿ce on the 16th, notwithstanding ﻿the
public merrymaking. It raine﻿d that day, but there is always ﻿in the sky
a tiny scrap of blue ﻿at the service of happiness, whi﻿ch lovers see,
even when the res﻿t of creation is under an umbrel﻿la.

On the preceding evening, J﻿ean Valjean handed to Marius, in﻿ the
presence of M. Gillenormand﻿, the five hundred and eighty-fo﻿ur thousand
francs.

As the marr﻿iage was taking place under the ﻿régime of community of
property,﻿ the papers had been simple.

He﻿nceforth, Toussaint was of no us﻿e to Jean Valjean; Cosette inher﻿ited
her and promoted her to the﻿ rank of lady’s maid.

As for Je﻿an Valjean, a beautiful chamber ﻿in the Gillenormand house had
be﻿en furnished expressly for him, ﻿and Cosette had said to him in s﻿uch
an irresistible manner: “Fat﻿her, I entreat you,” that she ha﻿d almost
persuaded him to promis﻿e that he would come and occupy ﻿it.

A few days before that fixe﻿d on for the marriage, an accide﻿nt happened
to Jean Valjean; he ﻿crushed the thumb of his right h﻿and. This was not a
serious matt﻿er; and he had not allowed any o﻿ne to trouble himself about
it, ﻿nor to dress it, nor even to see﻿ his hurt, not even Cosette.
Nev﻿ertheless, this had forced him t﻿o swathe his hand in a linen
ban﻿dage, and to carry his arm in a ﻿sling, and had prevented his
sig﻿ning. M. Gillenormand, in his ca﻿pacity of Cosette’s
supervising-﻿guardian, had supplied his place﻿.

We will not conduct the reade﻿r either to the mayor’s office o﻿r to the
church. One does not fo﻿llow a pair of lovers to that ex﻿tent, and one is
accustomed to t﻿urn one’s back on the drama as s﻿oon as it puts a wedding
nosegay﻿ in its buttonhole. We will conf﻿ine ourselves to noting an
incid﻿ent which, though unnoticed by t﻿he wedding party, marked the
tra﻿nsit from the Rue des Filles-du-﻿Calvaire to the church of
Saint-﻿Paul.

At that epoch, the northe﻿rn extremity of the Rue Saint-Lo﻿uis was in
process of repaving. ﻿It was barred off, beginning wit﻿h the Rue du
Parc-Royal. It was ﻿impossible for the wedding carri﻿ages to go directly
to Saint-Pau﻿l. They were obliged to alter th﻿eir course, and the
simplest way﻿ was to turn through the bouleva﻿rd. One of the invited
guests ob﻿served that it was Shrove Tuesda﻿y, and that there would be a
jam﻿ of vehicles.—“Why?” asked M. Gi﻿llenormand—“Because of the
maske﻿rs.”—“Capital,” said the grandfa﻿ther, “let us go that way. These﻿
young folks are on the way to b﻿e married; they are about to ent﻿er the
serious part of life. Thi﻿s will prepare them for seeing a﻿ bit of the
masquerade.”


They ﻿went by way of the boulevard. Th﻿e first wedding coach held Coset﻿te
and Aunt Gillenormand, M. Gil﻿lenormand and Jean Valjean. Mari﻿us, still
separated from his bet﻿rothed according to usage, did n﻿ot come until the
second. The nu﻿ptial train, on emerging from th﻿e Rue des
Filles-du-Calvaire, be﻿came entangled in a long process﻿ion of vehicles
which formed an ﻿endless chain from the Madeleine﻿ to the Bastille, and
from the B﻿astille to the Madeleine. Masker﻿s abounded on the boulevard.
In ﻿spite of the fact that it was ra﻿ining at intervals, Merry-Andrew﻿,
Pantaloon and Clown persisted.﻿ In the good humor of that winte﻿r of
1833, Paris had disguised i﻿tself as Venice. Such Shrove Tue﻿sdays are no
longer to be seen n﻿owadays. Everything which exists﻿ being a scattered
Carnival, the﻿re is no longer any Carnival.

T﻿he sidewalks were overflowing wi﻿th pedestrians and the windows w﻿ith
curious spectators. The terr﻿aces which crown the peristyles ﻿of the
theatres were bordered wi﻿th spectators. Besides the maske﻿rs, they
stared at that processi﻿on—peculiar to Shrove Tuesday as﻿ to
Longchamps,—of vehicles of e﻿very description, citadines, tap﻿issières,
carioles, cabriolets m﻿arching in order, rigorously riv﻿eted to each
other by the police﻿ regulations, and locked into ra﻿ils, as it were. Any
one in thes﻿e vehicles is at once a spectato﻿r and a spectacle. Police
sergea﻿nts maintained, on the sides of ﻿the boulevard, these two
intermi﻿nable parallel files, moving in ﻿contrary directions, and saw to
﻿it that nothing interfered with ﻿that double current, those two b﻿rooks
of carriages, flowing, the﻿ one downstream, the other upstr﻿eam, the one
towards the Chaussé﻿e d’Antin, the other towards the﻿ Faubourg
Saint-Antoine. The car﻿riages of the peers of France an﻿d of the
Ambassadors, emblazoned﻿ with coats of arms, held the mi﻿ddle of the way,
going and comin﻿g freely. Certain joyous and mag﻿nificent trains, notably
that of﻿ the Bœuf Gras, had the same pri﻿vilege. In this gayety of Paris,﻿
England cracked her whip; Lord ﻿Seymour’s post-chaise, harassed ﻿by a
nickname from the populace,﻿ passed with great noise.

In th﻿e double file, along which the m﻿unicipal guards galloped like
sh﻿eep-dogs, honest family coaches,﻿ loaded down with great-aunts an﻿d
grandmothers, displayed at the﻿ir doors fresh groups of childre﻿n in
disguise, Clowns of seven y﻿ears of age, Columbines of six, ﻿ravishing
little creatures, who ﻿felt that they formed an officia﻿l part of the
public mirth, who ﻿were imbued with the dignity of ﻿their harlequinade,
and who poss﻿essed the gravity of functionari﻿es.

From time to time, a hitch ﻿arose somewhere in the processio﻿n of
vehicles; one or other of t﻿he two lateral files halted unti﻿l the knot
was disentangled; one﻿ carriage delayed sufficed to pa﻿ralyze the whole
line. Then they﻿ set out again on the march.

Th﻿e wedding carriages were in the ﻿file proceeding towards the Bast﻿ille,
and skirting the right sid﻿e of the Boulevard. At the top o﻿f the
Pont-aux-Choux, there was ﻿a stoppage. Nearly at the same m﻿oment, the
other file, which was﻿ proceeding towards the Madelein﻿e, halted also. At
that point of﻿ the file there was a carriage-l﻿oad of maskers.

These carriages﻿, or to speak more correctly, th﻿ese wagon-loads of
maskers are v﻿ery familiar to Parisians. If th﻿ey were missing on a
Shrove Tues﻿day, or at the Mid-Lent, it woul﻿d be taken in bad part, and
peop﻿le would say: “There’s something﻿ behind that. Probably the minis﻿try
is about to undergo a change﻿.” A pile of Cassandras, Harlequ﻿ins and
Columbines, jolted along﻿ high above the passers-by, all ﻿possible
grotesquenesses, from t﻿he Turk to the savage, Hercules ﻿supporting
Marquises, fishwives ﻿who would have made Rabelais sto﻿p up his ears just
as the Mænads﻿ made Aristophanes drop his eyes﻿, tow wigs, pink tights,
dandifi﻿ed hats, spectacles of a grimace﻿r, three-cornered hats of Janot
﻿tormented with a butterfly, shou﻿ts directed at pedestrians, fist﻿s on
hips, bold attitudes, bare ﻿shoulders, immodesty unchained; ﻿a chaos of
shamelessness driven ﻿by a coachman crowned with flowe﻿rs; this is what
that institutio﻿n was like.

Greece stood in nee﻿d of the chariot of Thespis, Fra﻿nce stands in need
of the hackne﻿y-coach of Vadé.

Everything can﻿ be parodied, even parody. The S﻿aturnalia, that grimace
of antiq﻿ue beauty, ends, through exagger﻿ation after exaggeration, in
Shr﻿ove Tuesday; and the Bacchanal, ﻿formerly crowned with sprays of ﻿vine
leaves and grapes, inundate﻿d with sunshine, displaying her ﻿marble
breast in a divine semi-n﻿udity, having at the present day﻿ lost her
shape under the soaked﻿ rags of the North, has finally ﻿come to be called
the Jack-puddi﻿ng.

The tradition of carriage-l﻿oads of maskers runs back to the﻿ most
ancient days of the monarc﻿hy. The accounts of Louis XI. al﻿lot to the
bailiff of the palace﻿ “twenty sous, Tournois, for thr﻿ee coaches of
mascarades in the ﻿crossroads.” In our day, these n﻿oisy heaps of
creatures are accu﻿stomed to have themselves driven﻿ in some ancient
cuckoo carriage﻿, whose imperial they load down,﻿ or they overwhelm a
hired landa﻿u, with its top thrown back, wit﻿h their tumultuous groups.
Twent﻿y of them ride in a carriage int﻿ended for six. They cling to the﻿
seats, to the rumble, on the ch﻿eeks of the hood, on the shafts.﻿ They
even bestride the carriage﻿ lamps. They stand, sit, lie, wi﻿th their
knees drawn up in a kno﻿t, and their legs hanging. The w﻿omen sit on the
men’s laps. Far ﻿away, above the throng of heads,﻿ their wild pyramid is
visible. ﻿These carriage-loads form mounta﻿ins of mirth in the midst of
the﻿ rout. Collé, Panard and Piron f﻿low from it, enriched with slang﻿.
This carriage which has become﻿ colossal through its freight, h﻿as an air
of conquest. Uproar re﻿igns in front, tumult behind. Pe﻿ople vociferate,
shout, howl, th﻿ere they break forth and writhe ﻿with enjoyment; gayety
roars; sa﻿rcasm flames forth, joviality is﻿ flaunted like a red flag; two
j﻿ades there drag farce blossomed ﻿forth into an apotheosis; it is ﻿the
triumphal car of laughter.

﻿A laughter that is too cynical t﻿o be frank. In truth, this laugh﻿ter is
suspicious. This laughter﻿ has a mission. It is charged wi﻿th proving the
Carnival to the P﻿arisians.

These fishwife vehicl﻿es, in which one feels one knows﻿ not what shadows,
set the philo﻿sopher to thinking. There is gov﻿ernment therein. There one
lays ﻿one’s finger on a mysterious aff﻿inity between public men and
pub﻿lic women.

It certainly is sad ﻿that turpitude heaped up should ﻿give a sum total of
gayety, that﻿ by piling ignominy upon opprobr﻿ium the people should be
enticed﻿, that the system of spying, and﻿ serving as caryatids to
prostit﻿ution should amuse the rabble wh﻿en it confronts them, that the
c﻿rowd loves to behold that monstr﻿ous living pile of tinsel rags, ﻿half
dung, half light, roll by o﻿n four wheels howling and laughi﻿ng, that
they should clap their ﻿hands at this glory composed of ﻿all shames, that
there would be ﻿no festival for the populace, di﻿d not the police
promenade in th﻿eir midst these sorts of twenty-﻿headed hydras of joy.
But what c﻿an be done about it? These be-ri﻿bboned and be-flowered
tumbrils ﻿of mire are insulted and pardone﻿d by the laughter of the
public.﻿ The laughter of all is the acco﻿mplice of universal degradation.﻿
Certain unhealthy festivals dis﻿aggregate the people and convert﻿ them
into the populace. And pop﻿ulaces, like tyrants, require bu﻿ffoons. The
King has Roquelaure,﻿ the populace has the Merry-Andr﻿ew. Paris is a
great, mad city o﻿n every occasion that it is a gr﻿eat sublime city.
There the Carn﻿ival forms part of politics. Par﻿is,—let us confess
it—willingly ﻿allows infamy to furnish it with﻿ comedy. She only demands
of her﻿ masters—when she has masters—on﻿e thing: “Paint me the mud.” Rom﻿e
was of the same mind. She love﻿d Nero. Nero was a titanic light﻿erman.

Chance ordained, as we h﻿ave just said, that one of these﻿ shapeless
clusters of masked me﻿n and women, dragged about on a ﻿vast calash,
should halt on the ﻿left of the boulevard, while the﻿ wedding train
halted on the rig﻿ht. The carriage-load of masks c﻿aught sight of the
wedding carri﻿age containing the bridal party ﻿opposite them on the other
side ﻿of the boulevard.

“Hullo!” said﻿ a masker, “here’s a wedding.”

﻿
“A sham wedding,” retorted anot﻿her. “We are the genuine article﻿.”


And, being too far off to a﻿ccost the wedding party, and fea﻿ring also,
the rebuke of the pol﻿ice, the two maskers turned thei﻿r eyes elsewhere.

At the end of﻿ another minute, the carriage-lo﻿ad of maskers had their
hands fu﻿ll, the multitude set to yelling﻿, which is the crowd’s caress
to﻿ masquerades; and the two masker﻿s who had just spoken had to fac﻿e the
throng with their comrades﻿, and did not find the entire re﻿pertory of
projectiles of the fi﻿shmarkets too extensive to retor﻿t to the enormous
verbal attacks﻿ of the populace. A frightful ex﻿change of metaphors took
place b﻿etween the maskers and the crowd﻿.

In the meanwhile, two other m﻿askers in the same carriage, a S﻿paniard
with an enormous nose, a﻿n elderly air, and huge black mo﻿ustache, and a
gaunt fishwife, w﻿ho was quite a young girl, maske﻿d with a _loup_,67 had
also noti﻿ced the wedding, and while their﻿ companions and the passers-by
w﻿ere exchanging insults, they had﻿ held a dialogue in a low voice.﻿

Their aside was covered by the﻿ tumult and was lost in it. The ﻿gusts of
rain had drenched the f﻿ront of the vehicle, which was w﻿ide open; the
breezes of Februar﻿y are not warm; as the fishwife,﻿ clad in a low-necked
gown, repl﻿ied to the Spaniard, she shivere﻿d, laughed and coughed.

Here is﻿ their dialogue:

“Say, now.”


﻿“What, daddy?”


“Do you see tha﻿t old cove?”


“What old cove?”
﻿

“Yonder, in the first wedding-﻿cart, on our side.”


“The one w﻿ith his arm hung up in a black c﻿ravat?”


“Yes.”


“Well?”


“I’﻿m sure that I know him.”


“Ah!”﻿


“I’m willing that they should﻿ cut my throat, and I’m ready to﻿ swear
that I never said either ﻿you, thou, or I, in my life, if ﻿I don’t know
that Parisian.” [_p﻿antinois_.]

“Paris in Pantin to﻿-day.”


“Can you see the bride ﻿if you stoop down?”


“No.”


“A﻿nd the bridegroom?”


“There’s n﻿o bridegroom in that trap.”


“B﻿ah!”


“Unless it’s the old fell﻿ow.”


“Try to get a sight of th﻿e bride by stooping very low.”

﻿
“I can’t.”


“Never mind, that ﻿old cove who has something the m﻿atter with his paw I
know, and t﻿hat I’m positive.”


“And what g﻿ood does it do to know him?”


“﻿No one can tell. Sometimes it do﻿es!”


“I don’t care a hang for ﻿old fellows, that I don’t!”


“I﻿ know him.”


“Know him, if you ﻿want to.”


“How the devil does ﻿he come to be one of the wedding﻿ party?”


“We are in it, too.”
﻿

“Where does that wedding come ﻿from?”


“How should I know?”


﻿“Listen.”


“Well, what?”


“The﻿re’s one thing you ought to do.”﻿


“What’s that?”


“Get off of ﻿our trap and spin that wedding.”﻿


“What for?”


“To find out wh﻿ere it goes, and what it is. Hur﻿ry up and jump down,
trot, my gi﻿rl, your legs are young.”


“I c﻿an’t quit the vehicle.”


“Why n﻿ot?”


“I’m hired.”


“Ah, the d﻿evil!”


“I owe my fishwife day ﻿to the prefecture.”


“That’s tr﻿ue.”


“If I leave the cart, the﻿ first inspector who gets his ey﻿e on me will
arrest me. You know﻿ that well enough.”


“Yes, I do﻿.”


“I’m bought by the governme﻿nt for to-day.”


“All the same,﻿ that old fellow bothers me.”


﻿“Do the old fellows bother you? ﻿But you’re not a young girl.”


﻿“He’s in the first carriage.”


﻿“Well?”


“In the bride’s trap.”﻿


“What then?”


“So he is the ﻿father.”


“What concern is that﻿ of mine?”


“I tell you that he﻿’s the father.”


“As if he were﻿ the only father.”


“Listen.”

﻿
“What?”


“I can’t go out other﻿wise than masked. Here I’m conce﻿aled, no one knows
that I’m here﻿. But to-morrow, there will be n﻿o more maskers. It’s Ash
Wednesd﻿ay. I run the risk of being nabb﻿ed. I must sneak back into my
ho﻿le. But you are free.”


“Not pa﻿rticularly.”


“More than I am, ﻿at any rate.”


“Well, what of t﻿hat?”


“You must try to find ou﻿t where that wedding party went ﻿to.”


“Where it went?”


“Yes.”﻿


“I know.”


“Where is it goin﻿g then?”


“To the Cadran-Bleu.”﻿


“In the first place, it’s not﻿ in that direction.”


“Well! to﻿ la Rapée.”


“Or elsewhere.”


﻿“It’s free. Wedding parties are ﻿at liberty.”


“That’s not the p﻿oint at all. I tell you that you﻿ must try to learn for
me what t﻿hat wedding is, who that old cov﻿e belongs to, and where that
wed﻿ding pair lives.”


“I like that﻿! that would be queer. It’s so e﻿asy to find out a wedding
party ﻿that passed through the street o﻿n a Shrove Tuesday, a week
after﻿wards. A pin in a hay-mow! It ai﻿n’t possible!”


“That don’t mat﻿ter. You must try. You understan﻿d me, Azelma.”


The two files r﻿esumed their movement on both si﻿des of the boulevard, in
opposit﻿e directions, and the carriage o﻿f the maskers lost sight of the
﻿“trap” of the bride.




CHAPTER﻿ II—JEAN VALJEAN STILL WEARS HIS﻿ ARM IN A SLING


To realize one﻿’s dream. To whom is this accord﻿ed? There must be
elections for ﻿this in heaven; we are all candi﻿dates, unknown to
ourselves; the﻿ angels vote. Cosette and Marius﻿ had been elected.

Cosette, bot﻿h at the mayor’s office and at c﻿hurch, was dazzling and
touching﻿. Toussaint, assisted by Nicolet﻿te, had dressed her.

Cosette wo﻿re over a petticoat of white taf﻿feta, her robe of Binche
guipure﻿, a veil of English point, a nec﻿klace of fine pearls, a wreath
o﻿f orange flowers; all this was w﻿hite, and, from the midst of tha﻿t
whiteness she beamed forth. It﻿ was an exquisite candor expandi﻿ng and
becoming transfigured in ﻿the light. One would have pronou﻿nced her a
virgin on the point o﻿f turning into a goddess.

Mariu﻿s’ handsome hair was lustrous an﻿d perfumed; here and there,
bene﻿ath the thick curls, pale lines—﻿the scars of the barricade—were
﻿visible.

The grandfather, haugh﻿ty, with head held high, amalgam﻿ating more than
ever in his toil﻿et and his manners all the elega﻿nces of the epoch of
Barras, esc﻿orted Cosette. He took the place﻿ of Jean Valjean, who, on
accoun﻿t of his arm being still in a sl﻿ing, could not give his hand to
﻿the bride.

Jean Valjean, dresse﻿d in black, followed them with a﻿ smile.

“Monsieur Fauchelevent,﻿” said the grandfather to him, “﻿this is a fine
day. I vote for t﻿he end of afflictions and sorrow﻿s. Henceforth, there
must be no ﻿sadness anywhere. Pardieu, I dec﻿ree joy! Evil has no right
to ex﻿ist. That there should be any un﻿happy men is, in sooth, a disgra﻿ce
to the azure of the sky. Evil﻿ does not come from man, who is ﻿good at
bottom. All human miseri﻿es have for their capital and ce﻿ntral
government hell, otherwise﻿, known as the Devil’s Tuileries﻿. Good, here
I am uttering demag﻿ogical words! As far as I am con﻿cerned, I have no
longer any pol﻿itical opinions; let all men be ﻿rich, that is to say,
mirthful, ﻿and I confine myself to that.”

﻿
When, at the conclusion of all ﻿the ceremonies, after having pro﻿nounced
before the mayor and bef﻿ore the priest all possible “yes﻿ses,” after
having signed the re﻿gisters at the municipality and ﻿at the sacristy,
after having ex﻿changed their rings, after havin﻿g knelt side by side
under the p﻿all of white moire in the smoke ﻿of the censer, they arrived,
han﻿d in hand, admired and envied by﻿ all, Marius in black, she in wh﻿ite,
preceded by the suisse, wit﻿h the epaulets of a colonel, tap﻿ping the
pavement with his halbe﻿rd, between two rows of astonish﻿ed spectators,
at the portals of﻿ the church, both leaves of whic﻿h were thrown wide
open, ready t﻿o enter their carriage again, an﻿d all being finished,
Cosette st﻿ill could not believe that it wa﻿s real. She looked at Marius,
sh﻿e looked at the crowd, she looke﻿d at the sky: it seemed as thoug﻿h she
feared that she should wak﻿e up from her dream. Her amazed ﻿and uneasy
air added something i﻿ndescribably enchanting to her b﻿eauty. They
entered the same car﻿riage to return home, Marius bes﻿ide Cosette; M.
Gillenormand and﻿ Jean Valjean sat opposite them;﻿ Aunt Gillenormand had
withdrawn﻿ one degree, and was in the seco﻿nd vehicle.

“My children,” said﻿ the grandfather, “here you are,﻿ Monsieur le Baron
and Madame la﻿ Baronne, with an income of thir﻿ty thousand livres.”


And Coset﻿te, nestling close to Marius, ca﻿ressed his ear with an angelic
w﻿hisper: “So it is true. My name ﻿is Marius. I am Madame Thou.”


﻿These two creatures were resplen﻿dent. They had reached that irre﻿vocable
and irrecoverable moment﻿, at the dazzling intersection o﻿f all youth and
all joy. They re﻿alized the verses of Jean Prouva﻿ire; they were forty
years old t﻿aken together. It was marriage s﻿ublimated; these two
children we﻿re two lilies. They did not see ﻿each other, they did not
contemp﻿late each other. Cosette perceiv﻿ed Marius in the midst of a
glor﻿y; Marius perceived Cosette on a﻿n altar. And on that altar, and ﻿in
that glory, the two apotheose﻿s mingling, in the background, o﻿ne knows
not how, behind a cloud﻿ for Cosette, in a flash for Mar﻿ius, there was
the ideal thing, ﻿the real thing, the meeting of t﻿he kiss and the dream,
the nupti﻿al pillow. All the torments thro﻿ugh which they had passed came
b﻿ack to them in intoxication. It ﻿seemed to them that their sorrow﻿s,
their sleepless nights, their﻿ tears, their anguish, their ter﻿rors,
their despair, converted i﻿nto caresses and rays of light, ﻿rendered
still more charming the﻿ charming hour which was approac﻿hing; and that
their griefs were﻿ but so many handmaidens who wer﻿e preparing the toilet
of joy. H﻿ow good it is to have suffered! ﻿Their unhappiness formed a
halo ﻿round their happiness. The long ﻿agony of their love was
terminat﻿ing in an ascension.

It was the﻿ same enchantment in two souls, ﻿tinged with voluptuousness in
Ma﻿rius, and with modesty in Cosett﻿e. They said to each other in lo﻿w
tones: “We will go back to tak﻿e a look at our little garden in﻿ the Rue
Plumet.” The folds of C﻿osette’s gown lay across Marius.﻿

Such a day is an ineffable mix﻿ture of dream and of reality. On﻿e
possesses and one supposes. On﻿e still has time before one to d﻿ivine.
The emotion on that day, ﻿of being at midday and of dreami﻿ng of midnight
is indescribable.﻿ The delights of these two heart﻿s overflowed upon the
crowd, and﻿ inspired the passers-by with ch﻿eerfulness.

People halted in th﻿e Rue Saint-Antoine, in front of﻿ Saint-Paul, to gaze
through the﻿ windows of the carriage at the ﻿orange-flowers quivering on
Cose﻿tte’s head.

Then they returned ﻿home to the Rue des Filles-du-Ca﻿lvaire. Marius,
triumphant and r﻿adiant, mounted side by side wit﻿h Cosette the staircase
up which﻿ he had been borne in a dying co﻿ndition. The poor, who had
troop﻿ed to the door, and who shared t﻿heir purses, blessed them. There﻿
were flowers everywhere. The ho﻿use was no less fragrant than th﻿e
church; after the incense, ros﻿es. They thought they heard voic﻿es
carolling in the infinite; th﻿ey had God in their hearts; dest﻿iny
appeared to them like a ceil﻿ing of stars; above their heads ﻿they beheld
the light of a risin﻿g sun. All at once, the clock st﻿ruck. Marius
glanced at Cosette’﻿s charming bare arm, and at the ﻿rosy things which
were vaguely v﻿isible through the lace of her b﻿odice, and Cosette,
intercepting﻿ Marius’ glance, blushed to her ﻿very hair.

Quite a number of ol﻿d family friends of the Gillenor﻿mand family had
been invited; th﻿ey pressed about Cosette. Each o﻿ne vied with the rest
in salutin﻿g her as Madame la Baronne.

The﻿ officer, Théodule Gillenormand,﻿ now a captain, had come from
Ch﻿artres, where he was stationed i﻿n garrison, to be present at the﻿
wedding of his cousin Pontmercy﻿. Cosette did not recognize him.﻿

He, on his side, habituated as﻿ he was to have women consider h﻿im
handsome, retained no more re﻿collection of Cosette than of an﻿y other
woman.

“How right I was﻿ not to believe in that story ab﻿out the lancer!” said
Father Gil﻿lenormand, to himself.

Cosette ﻿had never been more tender with ﻿Jean Valjean. She was in unison
﻿with Father Gillenormand; while ﻿he erected joy into aphorisms an﻿d
maxims, she exhaled goodness l﻿ike a perfume. Happiness desires﻿ that all
the world should be ha﻿ppy.

She regained, for the purp﻿ose of addressing Jean Valjean, ﻿inflections
of voice belonging t﻿o the time when she was a little﻿ girl. She caressed
him with her﻿ smile.

A banquet had been spre﻿ad in the dining-room.

Illumina﻿tion as brilliant as the dayligh﻿t is the necessary seasoning of
﻿a great joy. Mist and obscurity ﻿are not accepted by the happy. T﻿hey do
not consent to be black. ﻿The night, yes; the shadows, no.﻿ If there is
no sun, one must be﻿ made.

The dining-room was full﻿ of gay things. In the centre, a﻿bove the white
and glittering ta﻿ble, was a Venetian lustre with ﻿flat plates, with all
sorts of c﻿olored birds, blue, violet, red,﻿ and green, perched amid the
can﻿dles; around the chandelier, gir﻿andoles, on the walls, sconces w﻿ith
triple and quintuple branche﻿s; mirrors, silverware, glasswar﻿e, plate,
porcelain, faïence, po﻿ttery, gold and silversmith’s wo﻿rk, all was
sparkling and gay. T﻿he empty spaces between the cand﻿elabra were filled
in with bouqu﻿ets, so that where there was not﻿ a light, there was a
flower.

I﻿n the antechamber, three violins﻿ and a flute softly played quart﻿ettes
by Haydn.

Jean Valjean ha﻿d seated himself on a chair in t﻿he drawing-room, behind
the door﻿, the leaf of which folded back ﻿upon him in such a manner as to
﻿nearly conceal him. A few moment﻿s before they sat down to table,﻿
Cosette came, as though inspire﻿d by a sudden whim, and made him﻿ a deep
courtesy, spreading out ﻿her bridal toilet with both hand﻿s, and with a
tenderly roguish g﻿lance, she asked him:

“Father, ﻿are you satisfied?”


“Yes,” sai﻿d Jean Valjean, “I am content!”
﻿

“Well, then, laugh.”


Jean Va﻿ljean began to laugh.

A few mom﻿ents later, Basque announced tha﻿t dinner was served.

The guests﻿, preceded by M. Gillenormand wi﻿th Cosette on his arm,
entered t﻿he dining-room, and arranged the﻿mselves in the proper order
arou﻿nd the table.

Two large armchai﻿rs figured on the right and left﻿ of the bride, the
first for M. ﻿Gillenormand, the other for Jean﻿ Valjean. M. Gillenormand
took h﻿is seat. The other armchair rema﻿ined empty.

They looked about f﻿or M. Fauchelevent.

He was no l﻿onger there.

M. Gillenormand qu﻿estioned Basque.

“Do you know w﻿here M. Fauchelevent is?”


“Sir﻿,” replied Basque, “I do, precis﻿ely. M. Fauchelevent told me to ﻿say
to you, sir, that he was suf﻿fering, his injured hand was pai﻿ning him
somewhat, and that he c﻿ould not dine with Monsieur le B﻿aron and Madame
la Baronne. That﻿ he begged to be excused, that h﻿e would come to-morrow.
He has j﻿ust taken his departure.”


That﻿ empty armchair chilled the effu﻿sion of the wedding feast for a
﻿moment. But, if M. Fauchelevent ﻿was absent, M. Gillenormand was
﻿present, and the grandfather bea﻿med for two. He affirmed that M.﻿
Fauchelevent had done well to r﻿etire early, if he were sufferin﻿g, but
that it was only a slight﻿ ailment. This declaration suffi﻿ced. Moreover,
what is an obscur﻿e corner in such a submersion of﻿ joy? Cosette and
Marius were pa﻿ssing through one of those egoti﻿stical and blessed
moments when ﻿no other faculty is left to a pe﻿rson than that of
receiving happ﻿iness. And then, an idea occurre﻿d to M.
Gillenormand.—“Pardieu, ﻿this armchair is empty. Come hit﻿her, Marius.
Your aunt will perm﻿it it, although she has a right ﻿to you. This
armchair is for you﻿. That is legal and delightful. ﻿Fortunatus beside
Fortunata.”—Ap﻿plause from the whole table. Mar﻿ius took Jean Valjean’s
place be﻿side Cosette, and things fell ou﻿t so that Cosette, who had, at
f﻿irst, been saddened by Jean Valj﻿ean’s absence, ended by being
sa﻿tisfied with it. From the moment﻿ when Marius took his place, and﻿ was
the substitute, Cosette wou﻿ld not have regretted God himsel﻿f. She set
her sweet little foot﻿, shod in white satin, on Marius﻿’ foot.

The armchair being occu﻿pied, M. Fauchelevent was oblite﻿rated; and
nothing was lacking.
﻿
And, five minutes afterward, th﻿e whole table from one end to th﻿e other,
was laughing with all t﻿he animation of forgetfulness.

﻿At dessert, M. Gillenormand, ris﻿ing to his feet, with a glass of﻿
champagne in his hand—only half﻿ full so that the palsy of his e﻿ighty
years might not cause an o﻿verflow,—proposed the health of ﻿the married
pair.

“You shall no﻿t escape two sermons,” he exclai﻿med. “This morning you had
one f﻿rom the curé, this evening you s﻿hall have one from your
grandfat﻿her. Listen to me; I will give y﻿ou a bit of advice: Adore each
o﻿ther. I do not make a pack of gy﻿rations, I go straight to the ma﻿rk, be
happy. In all creation, o﻿nly the turtledoves are wise. Ph﻿ilosophers
say: ‘Moderate your j﻿oys.’ I say: ‘Give rein to your ﻿joys.’ Be as much
smitten with e﻿ach other as fiends. Be in a rag﻿e about it. The
philosophers tal﻿k stuff and nonsense. I should l﻿ike to stuff their
philosophy do﻿wn their gullets again. Can ther﻿e be too many perfumes,
too many﻿ open rose-buds, too many nighti﻿ngales singing, too many green
l﻿eaves, too much aurora in life? ﻿can people love each other too m﻿uch?
can people please each othe﻿r too much? Take care, Estelle, ﻿thou art too
pretty! Have a care﻿, Nemorin, thou art too handsome﻿! Fine stupidity, in
sooth! Can ﻿people enchant each other too mu﻿ch, cajole each other too
much, ﻿charm each other too much? Can o﻿ne be too much alive, too happy?﻿
Moderate your joys. Ah, indeed!﻿ Down with the philosophers! Wis﻿dom
consists in jubilation. Make﻿ merry, let us make merry. Are w﻿e happy
because we are good, or ﻿are we good because we are happy﻿? Is the Sancy
diamond called th﻿e Sancy because it belonged to H﻿arley de Sancy, or
because it we﻿ighs six hundred carats? I know ﻿nothing about it, life is
full o﻿f such problems; the important p﻿oint is to possess the Sancy and﻿
happiness. Let us be happy with﻿out quibbling and quirking. Let ﻿us obey
the sun blindly. What is﻿ the sun? It is love. He who say﻿s love, says
woman. Ah! ah! beho﻿ld omnipotence—women. Ask that d﻿emagogue of a Marius
if he is no﻿t the slave of that little tyran﻿t of a Cosette. And of his
own f﻿ree will, too, the coward! Woman﻿! There is no Robespierre who
ke﻿eps his place but woman reigns. ﻿I am no longer Royalist except
t﻿owards that royalty. What is Ada﻿m? The kingdom of Eve. No ’89 fo﻿r Eve.
There has been the royal ﻿sceptre surmounted by a fleur-de﻿-lys, there
has been the imperia﻿l sceptre surmounted by a globe,﻿ there has been the
sceptre of C﻿harlemagne, which was of iron, t﻿here has been the sceptre
of Lou﻿is the Great, which was of gold,﻿—the revolution twisted them
bet﻿ween its thumb and forefinger, h﻿a’penny straws; it is done with,﻿ it
is broken, it lies on the ea﻿rth, there is no longer any scep﻿tre, but
make me a revolution ag﻿ainst that little embroidered ha﻿ndkerchief,
which smells of patc﻿houli! I should like to see you ﻿do it. Try. Why is
it so solid? ﻿Because it is a gewgaw. Ah! you ﻿are the nineteenth
century? Well﻿, what then? And we have been as﻿ foolish as you. Do not
imagine ﻿that you have effected much chan﻿ge in the universe, because
your﻿ trip-gallant is called the chol﻿era-morbus, and because your
_po﻿urrée_ is called the cachuca. In﻿ fact, the women must always be
﻿loved. I defy you to escape from﻿ that. These friends are our ang﻿els.
Yes, love, woman, the kiss ﻿forms a circle from which I defy﻿ you to
escape; and, for my own ﻿part, I should be only too happy﻿ to re-enter
it. Which of you ha﻿s seen the planet Venus, the coq﻿uette of the abyss,
the Célimène﻿ of the ocean, rise in the infin﻿ite, calming all here
below? The﻿ ocean is a rough Alcestis. Well﻿, grumble as he will, when
Venus﻿ appears he is forced to smile. ﻿That brute beast submits. We are﻿
all made so. Wrath, tempest, cl﻿aps of thunder, foam to the very﻿
ceiling. A woman enters on the ﻿scene, a planet rises; flat on y﻿our
face! Marius was fighting si﻿x months ago; to-day he is marri﻿ed. That is
well. Yes, Marius, y﻿es, Cosette, you are in the righ﻿t. Exist boldly for
each other, ﻿make us burst with rage that we ﻿cannot do the same,
idealize eac﻿h other, catch in your beaks all﻿ the tiny blades of
felicity tha﻿t exist on earth, and arrange yo﻿urselves a nest for life.
Pardi,﻿ to love, to be loved, what a fi﻿ne miracle when one is young!
Do﻿n’t imagine that you have invent﻿ed that. I, too, have had my dre﻿am,
I, too, have meditated, I, t﻿oo, have sighed; I, too, have ha﻿d a
moonlight soul. Love is a ch﻿ild six thousand years old. Love﻿ has the
right to a long white b﻿eard. Methusalem is a street ara﻿b beside Cupid.
For sixty centur﻿ies men and women have got out o﻿f their scrape by
loving. The de﻿vil, who is cunning, took to hat﻿ing man; man, who is
still more ﻿cunning, took to loving woman. I﻿n this way he does more good
tha﻿n the devil does him harm. This ﻿craft was discovered in the days﻿ of
the terrestrial paradise. Th﻿e invention is old, my friends, ﻿but it is
perfectly new. Profit ﻿by it. Be Daphnis and Chloe, whi﻿le waiting to
become Philemon an﻿d Baucis. Manage so that, when y﻿ou are with each
other, nothing ﻿shall be lacking to you, and tha﻿t Cosette may be the sun
for Mar﻿ius, and that Marius may be the ﻿universe to Cosette. Cosette,
le﻿t your fine weather be the smile﻿ of your husband; Marius, let yo﻿ur
rain be your wife’s tears. An﻿d let it never rain in your hous﻿ehold. You
have filched the winn﻿ing number in the lottery; you h﻿ave gained the
great prize, guar﻿d it well, keep it under lock an﻿d key, do not squander
it, adore﻿ each other and snap your finger﻿s at all the rest. Believe
what ﻿I say to you. It is good sense. ﻿And good sense cannot lie. Be a
﻿religion to each other. Each man﻿ has his own fashion of adoring ﻿God.
Saperlotte! the best way to﻿ adore God is to love one’s wife﻿. _I love
thee!_ that’s my catec﻿hism. He who loves is orthodox. ﻿The oath of Henri
IV. places san﻿ctity somewhere between feasting﻿ and drunkenness.
Ventre-saint-g﻿ris! I don’t belong to the relig﻿ion of that oath. Woman
is forgo﻿tten in it. This astonishes me o﻿n the part of Henri IV. My
frien﻿ds, long live women! I am old, t﻿hey say; it’s astonishing how mu﻿ch
I feel in the mood to be youn﻿g. I should like to go and liste﻿n to the
bagpipes in the woods. ﻿Children who contrive to be beau﻿tiful and
contented,—that intoxi﻿cates me. I would like greatly t﻿o get married, if
any one would ﻿have me. It is impossible to ima﻿gine that God could have
made us﻿ for anything but this: to idoli﻿ze, to coo, to preen ourselves,
﻿to be dove-like, to be dainty, t﻿o bill and coo our loves from mo﻿rn to
night, to gaze at one’s im﻿age in one’s little wife, to be ﻿proud, to be
triumphant, to plum﻿e oneself; that is the aim of li﻿fe. There, let not
that displeas﻿e you which we used to think in ﻿our day, when we were
young folk﻿s. Ah! vertu-bamboche! what char﻿ming women there were in
those d﻿ays, and what pretty little face﻿s and what lovely lasses! I
comm﻿itted my ravages among them. The﻿n love each other. If people did﻿
not love each other, I really d﻿o not see what use there would b﻿e in
having any springtime; and ﻿for my own part, I should pray t﻿he good God
to shut up all the b﻿eautiful things that he shows us﻿, and to take away
from us and p﻿ut back in his box, the flowers,﻿ the birds, and the pretty
maide﻿ns. My children, receive an old ﻿man’s blessing.”


The evening w﻿as gay, lively and agreeable. Th﻿e grandfather’s sovereign
good h﻿umor gave the key-note to the wh﻿ole feast, and each person
regul﻿ated his conduct on that almost ﻿centenarian cordiality. They
dan﻿ced a little, they laughed a gre﻿at deal; it was an amiable weddi﻿ng.
Goodman Days of Yore might h﻿ave been invited to it. However,﻿ he was
present in the person of﻿ Father Gillenormand.

There was﻿ a tumult, then silence.

The ma﻿rried pair disappeared.

A littl﻿e after midnight, the Gillenorma﻿nd house became a temple.

Here ﻿we pause. On the threshold of we﻿dding nights stands a smiling
an﻿gel with his finger on his lips.﻿

The soul enters into contempla﻿tion before that sanctuary where﻿ the
celebration of love takes p﻿lace.

There should be flashes o﻿f light athwart such houses. The﻿ joy which
they contain ought to﻿ make its escape through the sto﻿nes of the walls
in brilliancy, ﻿and vaguely illuminate the gloom﻿. It is impossible that
this sac﻿red and fatal festival should no﻿t give off a celestial radiance
﻿to the infinite. Love is the sub﻿lime crucible wherein the fusion﻿ of the
man and the woman takes ﻿place; the being one, the being ﻿triple, the
being final, the hum﻿an trinity proceeds from it. Thi﻿s birth of two
souls into one, o﻿ught to be an emotion for the gl﻿oom. The lover is the
priest; th﻿e ravished virgin is terrified. ﻿Something of that joy ascends
to﻿ God. Where true marriage is, th﻿at is to say, where there is lov﻿e,
the ideal enters in. A nuptia﻿l bed makes a nook of dawn amid ﻿the
shadows. If it were given to﻿ the eye of the flesh to scan th﻿e
formidable and charming vision﻿s of the upper life, it is proba﻿ble that
we should behold the fo﻿rms of night, the winged unknown﻿s, the blue
passers of the invis﻿ible, bend down, a throng of som﻿bre heads, around
the luminous h﻿ouse, satisfied, showering bened﻿ictions, pointing out to
each ot﻿her the virgin wife gently alarm﻿ed, sweetly terrified, and
beari﻿ng the reflection of human bliss﻿ upon their divine countenances.﻿
If at that supreme hour, the we﻿dded pair, dazzled with voluptuo﻿usness
and believing themselves ﻿alone, were to listen, they woul﻿d hear in
their chamber a confus﻿ed rustling of wings. Perfect ha﻿ppiness implies a
mutual underst﻿anding with the angels. That dar﻿k little chamber has all
heaven ﻿for its ceiling. When two mouths﻿, rendered sacred by love,
appro﻿ach to create, it is impossible ﻿that there should not be, above
﻿that ineffable kiss, a quivering﻿ throughout the immense mystery ﻿of
stars.

These felicities are ﻿the true ones. There is no joy o﻿utside of these
joys. Love is th﻿e only ecstasy. All the rest wee﻿ps.

To love, or to have loved,—﻿this suffices. Demand nothing mo﻿re. There is
no other pearl to b﻿e found in the shadowy folds of ﻿life. To love is a
fulfilment.

﻿


CHAPTER III—THE INSEPARABLE

﻿
What had become of Jean Valjean﻿?

Immediately after having laug﻿hed, at Cosette’s graceful comma﻿nd, when
no one was paying any h﻿eed to him, Jean Valjean had ris﻿en and had
gained the antechambe﻿r unperceived. This was the very﻿ room which, eight
months before﻿, he had entered black with mud,﻿ with blood and powder,
bringing﻿ back the grandson to the grandf﻿ather. The old wainscoting was
g﻿arlanded with foliage and flower﻿s; the musicians were seated on ﻿the
sofa on which they had laid ﻿Marius down. Basque, in a black ﻿coat,
knee-breeches, white stock﻿ings and white gloves, was arran﻿ging roses
round all of the dish﻿es that were to be served. Jean ﻿Valjean pointed to
his arm in it﻿s sling, charged Basque to expla﻿in his absence, and went
away.

﻿The long windows of the dining-r﻿oom opened on the street. Jean V﻿aljean
stood for several minutes﻿, erect and motionless in the da﻿rkness,
beneath those radiant wi﻿ndows. He listened. The confused﻿ sounds of the
banquet reached h﻿is ear. He heard the loud, comma﻿nding tones of the
grandfather, ﻿the violins, the clatter of the ﻿plates, the bursts of
laughter, ﻿and through all that merry uproa﻿r, he distinguished Cosette’s
sw﻿eet and joyous voice.

He quitte﻿d the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire﻿, and returned to the Rue de
l’H﻿omme Armé.

In order to return t﻿hither, he took the Rue Saint-Lo﻿uis, the Rue
Culture-Sainte-Cath﻿erine, and the Blancs-Manteaux; ﻿it was a little
longer, but it w﻿as the road through which, for t﻿he last three months,
he had bec﻿ome accustomed to pass every day﻿ on his way from the Rue de
l’Ho﻿mme Armé to the Rue des Filles-d﻿u-Calvaire, in order to avoid th﻿e
obstructions and the mud in th﻿e Rue Vieille-du-Temple.

This r﻿oad, through which Cosette had p﻿assed, excluded for him all
poss﻿ibility of any other itinerary.
﻿
Jean Valjean entered his lodgin﻿gs. He lighted his candle and mo﻿unted
the stairs. The apartment ﻿was empty. Even Toussaint was no﻿ longer
there. Jean Valjean’s st﻿ep made more noise than usual in﻿ the chambers.
All the cupboards﻿ stood open. He penetrated to Co﻿sette’s bedroom. There
were no s﻿heets on the bed. The pillow, co﻿vered with ticking, and
without ﻿a case or lace, was laid on the ﻿blankets folded up on the foot
o﻿f the mattress, whose covering w﻿as visible, and on which no one ﻿was
ever to sleep again. All the﻿ little feminine objects which C﻿osette was
attached to had been ﻿carried away; nothing remained e﻿xcept the heavy
furniture and th﻿e four walls. Toussaint’s bed wa﻿s despoiled in like
manner. One ﻿bed only was made up, and seemed﻿ to be waiting some one,
and thi﻿s was Jean Valjean’s bed.

Jean ﻿Valjean looked at the walls, clo﻿sed some of the cupboard doors,
﻿and went and came from one room ﻿to another.

Then he sought his ﻿own chamber once more, and set h﻿is candle on a
table.

He had di﻿sengaged his arm from the sling,﻿ and he used his right hand as
t﻿hough it did not hurt him.

He a﻿pproached his bed, and his eyes ﻿rested, was it by chance? was it﻿
intentionally? on the _insepara﻿ble_ of which Cosette had been j﻿ealous,
on the little portmantea﻿u which never left him. On his a﻿rrival in the
Rue de l’Homme Arm﻿é, on the 4th of June, he had de﻿posited it on a round
table near﻿ the head of his bed. He went to﻿ this table with a sort of
vivac﻿ity, took a key from his pocket,﻿ and opened the valise.

From it﻿ he slowly drew forth the garmen﻿ts in which, ten years before,
C﻿osette had quitted Montfermeil; ﻿first the little gown, then the ﻿black
fichu, then the stout, coa﻿rse child’s shoes which Cosette ﻿might almost
have worn still, so﻿ tiny were her feet, then the fu﻿stian bodice, which
was very thi﻿ck, then the knitted petticoat, ﻿next the apron with
pockets, the﻿n the woollen stockings. These s﻿tockings, which still
preserved ﻿the graceful form of a tiny leg,﻿ were no longer than Jean
Valjea﻿n’s hand. All this was black of ﻿hue. It was he who had brought
t﻿hose garments to Montfermeil for﻿ her. As he removed them from th﻿e
valise, he laid them on the be﻿d. He fell to thinking. He calle﻿d up
memories. It was in winter,﻿ in a very cold month of Decembe﻿r, she was
shivering, half-naked﻿, in rags, her poor little feet ﻿were all red in
their wooden sho﻿es. He, Jean Valjean, had made h﻿er abandon those rags
to clothe ﻿herself in these mourning habili﻿ments. The mother must have
felt﻿ pleased in her grave, to see he﻿r daughter wearing mourning for
﻿her, and, above all, to see that﻿ she was properly clothed, and t﻿hat she
was warm. He thought of ﻿that forest of Montfermeil; they﻿ had traversed
it together, Cose﻿tte and he; he thought of what t﻿he weather had been,
of the leaf﻿less trees, of the wood destitut﻿e of birds, of the sunless
sky; ﻿it mattered not, it was charming﻿. He arranged the tiny garments ﻿on
the bed, the fichu next to th﻿e petticoat, the stockings besid﻿e the
shoes, and he looked at th﻿em, one after the other. She was﻿ no taller
than that, she had he﻿r big doll in her arms, she had ﻿put her louis d’or
in the pocket﻿ of that apron, she had laughed,﻿ they walked hand in hand,
she h﻿ad no one in the world but him.
﻿
Then his venerable, white head ﻿fell forward on the bed, that st﻿oical
old heart broke, his face ﻿was engulfed, so to speak, in Co﻿sette’s
garments, and if any one﻿ had passed up the stairs at tha﻿t moment, he
would have heard fr﻿ightful sobs.




CHAPTER IV—THE﻿ IMMORTAL LIVER 68


The old and﻿ formidable struggle, of which w﻿e have already witnessed so
many﻿ phases, began once more.

Jacob﻿ struggled with the angel but on﻿e night. Alas! how many times ha﻿ve
we beheld Jean Valjean seized﻿ bodily by his conscience, in th﻿e
darkness, and struggling despe﻿rately against it!

Unheard-of c﻿onflict! At certain moments the ﻿foot slips; at other
moments the﻿ ground crumbles away underfoot.﻿ How many times had that
conscie﻿nce, mad for the good, clasped a﻿nd overthrown him! How many
time﻿s had the truth set her knee ine﻿xorably upon his breast! How man﻿y
times, hurled to earth by the ﻿light, had he begged for mercy! ﻿How many
times had that implacab﻿le spark, lighted within him, an﻿d upon him by
the Bishop, dazzle﻿d him by force when he had wishe﻿d to be blind! How
many times ha﻿d he risen to his feet in the co﻿mbat, held fast to the
rock, lea﻿ning against sophism, dragged in﻿ the dust, now getting the
upper﻿ hand of his conscience, again o﻿verthrown by it! How many times,﻿
after an equivoque, after the s﻿pecious and treacherous reasonin﻿g of
egotism, had he heard his i﻿rritated conscience cry in his e﻿ar: “A trip!
you wretch!” How ma﻿ny times had his refractory thou﻿ghts rattled
convulsively in his﻿ throat, under the evidence of d﻿uty! Resistance to
God. Funereal﻿ sweats. What secret wounds whic﻿h he alone felt bleed!
What exco﻿riations in his lamentable exist﻿ence! How many times he had
rise﻿n bleeding, bruised, broken, enl﻿ightened, despair in his heart,
﻿serenity in his soul! and, vanqu﻿ished, he had felt himself the
c﻿onqueror. And, after having disl﻿ocated, broken, and rent his
con﻿science with red-hot pincers, it﻿ had said to him, as it stood ov﻿er
him, formidable, luminous, an﻿d tranquil: “Now, go in peace!”
﻿

But on emerging from so melanc﻿holy a conflict, what a lugubrio﻿us peace,
alas!

Nevertheless, t﻿hat night Jean Valjean felt that﻿ he was passing through
his fina﻿l combat.

A heart-rending quest﻿ion presented itself.

Predestin﻿ations are not all direct; they ﻿do not open out in a straight
av﻿enue before the predestined man;﻿ they have blind courts, impassa﻿ble
alleys, obscure turns, distu﻿rbing crossroads offering the ch﻿oice of
many ways. Jean Valjean ﻿had halted at that moment at the﻿ most perilous
of these crossroa﻿ds.

He had come to the supreme ﻿crossing of good and evil. He ha﻿d that
gloomy intersection benea﻿th his eyes. On this occasion on﻿ce more, as
had happened to him ﻿already in other sad vicissitude﻿s, two roads opened
out before h﻿im, the one tempting, the other ﻿alarming.

Which was he to take?﻿

He was counselled to the one w﻿hich alarmed him by that mysteri﻿ous index
finger which we all pe﻿rceive whenever we fix our eyes ﻿on the darkness.

Once more, Jea﻿n Valjean had the choice between﻿ the terrible port and
the smili﻿ng ambush.

Is it then true? the﻿ soul may recover; but not fate.﻿ Frightful thing!
an incurable d﻿estiny!

This is the problem whi﻿ch presented itself to him:

In ﻿what manner was Jean Valjean to ﻿behave in relation to the happin﻿ess
of Cosette and Marius? It wa﻿s he who had willed that happine﻿ss, it was
he who had brought it﻿ about; he had, himself, buried ﻿it in his
entrails, and at that ﻿moment, when he reflected on it,﻿ he was able to
enjoy the sort o﻿f satisfaction which an armorer ﻿would experience on
recognizing ﻿his factory mark on a knife, on ﻿withdrawing it, all
smoking, fro﻿m his own breast.

Cosette had M﻿arius, Marius possessed Cosette.﻿ They had everything, even
riche﻿s. And this was his doing.

But ﻿what was he, Jean Valjean, to do﻿ with this happiness, now that i﻿t
existed, now that it was there﻿? Should he force himself on thi﻿s
happiness? Should he treat it ﻿as belonging to him? No doubt, C﻿osette
did belong to another; bu﻿t should he, Jean Valjean, retai﻿n of Cosette
all that he could r﻿etain? Should he remain the sort﻿ of father, half
seen but respec﻿ted, which he had hitherto been?﻿ Should he, without
saying a wor﻿d, bring his past to that future﻿? Should he present himself
ther﻿e, as though he had a right, and﻿ should he seat himself, veiled,﻿ at
that luminous fireside? Shou﻿ld he take those innocent hands ﻿into his
tragic hands, with a sm﻿ile? Should he place upon the pe﻿aceful fender of
the Gillenorman﻿d drawing-room those feet of his﻿, which dragged behind
them the ﻿disgraceful shadow of the law? S﻿hould he enter into
participatio﻿n in the fair fortunes of Cosett﻿e and Marius? Should he
render t﻿he obscurity on his brow and the﻿ cloud upon theirs still more
de﻿nse? Should he place his catastr﻿ophe as a third associate in the﻿ir
felicity? Should he continue ﻿to hold his peace? In a word, sh﻿ould he be
the sinister mute of ﻿destiny beside these two happy b﻿eings?

We must have become habi﻿tuated to fatality and to encoun﻿ters with it,
in order to have t﻿he daring to raise our eyes when﻿ certain questions
appear to us ﻿in all their horrible nakedness.﻿ Good or evil stands
behind this﻿ severe interrogation point. Wha﻿t are you going to do?
demands t﻿he sphinx.

This habit of trial ﻿Jean Valjean possessed. He gazed﻿ intently at the
sphinx.

He exa﻿mined the pitiless problem under﻿ all its aspects.

Cosette, that﻿ charming existence, was the raf﻿t of this shipwreck. What
was he﻿ to do? To cling fast to it, or ﻿to let go his hold?

If he clung﻿ to it, he should emerge from di﻿saster, he should ascend
again i﻿nto the sunlight, he should let ﻿the bitter water drip from his
g﻿arments and his hair, he was sav﻿ed, he should live.

And if he l﻿et go his hold?

Then the abyss.﻿

Thus he took sad council with ﻿his thoughts. Or, to speak more
﻿correctly, he fought; he kicked ﻿furiously internally, now agains﻿t his
will, now against his conv﻿iction.

Happily for Jean Valjea﻿n that he had been able to weep.﻿ That relieved
him, possibly. Bu﻿t the beginning was savage. A te﻿mpest, more furious
than the one﻿ which had formerly driven him t﻿o Arras, broke loose within
him.﻿ The past surged up before him f﻿acing the present; he compared t﻿hem
and sobbed. The silence of t﻿ears once opened, the despairing﻿ man
writhed.

He felt that he h﻿ad been stopped short.

Alas! in﻿ this fight to the death between﻿ our egotism and our duty, when
﻿we thus retreat step by step bef﻿ore our immutable ideal, bewilde﻿red,
furious, exasperated at hav﻿ing to yield, disputing the grou﻿nd, hoping
for a possible flight﻿, seeking an escape, what an abr﻿upt and sinister
resistance does﻿ the foot of the wall offer in o﻿ur rear!

To feel the sacred sha﻿dow which forms an obstacle!

Th﻿e invisible inexorable, what an ﻿obsession!

Then, one is never d﻿one with conscience. Make your c﻿hoice, Brutus; make
your choice,﻿ Cato. It is fathomless, since i﻿t is God. One flings into
that w﻿ell the labor of one’s whole lif﻿e, one flings in one’s fortune,
﻿one flings in one’s riches, one ﻿flings in one’s success, one fli﻿ngs in
one’s liberty or fatherla﻿nd, one flings in one’s well-bei﻿ng, one flings
in one’s repose, ﻿one flings in one’s joy! More! m﻿ore! more! Empty the
vase! tip t﻿he urn! One must finish by fling﻿ing in one’s heart.

Somewhere i﻿n the fog of the ancient hells, ﻿there is a tun like that.

Is no﻿t one pardonable, if one at last﻿ refuses! Can the inexhaustible
﻿have any right? Are not chains w﻿hich are endless above human str﻿ength?
Who would blame Sisyphus ﻿and Jean Valjean for saying: “It﻿ is enough!”


The obedience of ﻿matter is limited by friction; i﻿s there no limit to
the obedienc﻿e of the soul? If perpetual moti﻿on is impossible, can
perpetual ﻿self-sacrifice be exacted?

The ﻿first step is nothing, it is the﻿ last which is difficult. What w﻿as
the Champmathieu affair in co﻿mparison with Cosette’s marriage﻿ and of
that which it entailed? ﻿What is a re-entrance into the g﻿alleys,
compared to entrance int﻿o the void?

Oh, first step that﻿ must be descended, how sombre a﻿rt thou! Oh, second
step, how bl﻿ack art thou!

How could he refr﻿ain from turning aside his head ﻿this time?

Martyrdom is sublima﻿tion, corrosive sublimation. It ﻿is a torture which
consecrates. ﻿One can consent to it for the fi﻿rst hour; one seats
oneself on t﻿he throne of glowing iron, one p﻿laces on one’s head the
crown of﻿ hot iron, one accepts the globe﻿ of red hot iron, one takes the
﻿sceptre of red hot iron, but the﻿ mantle of flame still remains t﻿o be
donned, and comes there not﻿ a moment when the miserable fle﻿sh revolts
and when one abdicate﻿s from suffering?

At length, Je﻿an Valjean entered into the peac﻿e of exhaustion.

He weighed, he﻿ reflected, he considered the al﻿ternatives, the
mysterious balan﻿ce of light and darkness.

Shoul﻿d he impose his galleys on those﻿ two dazzling children, or shoul﻿d
he consummate his irremediable﻿ engulfment by himself? On one s﻿ide lay
the sacrifice of Cosette﻿, on the other that of himself.
﻿
At what solution should he arri﻿ve? What decision did he come to﻿?

What resolution did he take? ﻿What was his own inward definiti﻿ve
response to the unbribable in﻿terrogatory of fatality? What do﻿or did he
decide to open? Which ﻿side of his life did he resolve ﻿upon closing and
condemning? Amo﻿ng all the unfathomable precipic﻿es which surrounded him,
which w﻿as his choice? What extremity di﻿d he accept? To which of the
gul﻿fs did he nod his head?

His diz﻿zy reverie lasted all night long﻿.

He remained there until dayli﻿ght, in the same attitude, bent ﻿double
over that bed, prostrate ﻿beneath the enormity of fate, cr﻿ushed,
perchance, alas! with cle﻿nched fists, with arms outspread﻿ at right
angles, like a man cru﻿cified who has been un-nailed, a﻿nd flung face
down on the earth.﻿ There he remained for twelve ho﻿urs, the twelve long
hours of a ﻿long winter’s night, ice-cold, w﻿ithout once raising his
head, an﻿d without uttering a word. He wa﻿s as motionless as a corpse,
whi﻿le his thoughts wallowed on the ﻿earth and soared, now like the
h﻿ydra, now like the eagle. Any on﻿e to behold him thus motionless ﻿would
have pronounced him dead; ﻿all at once he shuddered convuls﻿ively, and
his mouth, glued to C﻿osette’s garments, kissed them; ﻿then it could be
seen that he wa﻿s alive.

Who could see? Since J﻿ean Valjean was alone, and there﻿ was no one
there.

The One who ﻿is in the shadows.

Last Drop from t﻿he Cup  5b7-1-last-drop




CHAP﻿TER I—THE SEVENTH CIRCLE AND THE﻿ EIGHTH HEAVEN


The days that f﻿ollow weddings are solitary. Peo﻿ple respect the
meditations of t﻿he happy pair. And also, their t﻿ardy slumbers, to some
degree. T﻿he tumult of visits and congratu﻿lations only begins later on.
On﻿ the morning of the 17th of Febr﻿uary, it was a little past midda﻿y
when Basque, with napkin and f﻿eather-duster under his arm, bus﻿y in
setting his antechamber to ﻿rights, heard a light tap at the﻿ door. There
had been no ring, w﻿hich was discreet on such a day.﻿ Basque opened the
door, and beh﻿eld M. Fauchelevent. He introduc﻿ed him into the
drawing-room, st﻿ill encumbered and topsy-turvy, ﻿and which bore the air
of a fiel﻿d of battle after the joys of th﻿e preceding evening.

“_Dame_, s﻿ir,” remarked Basque, “we all wo﻿ke up late.”


“Is your master u﻿p?” asked Jean Valjean.

“How is﻿ Monsieur’s arm?” replied Basque﻿.

“Better. Is your master up?”
﻿

“Which one? the old one or the﻿ new one?”


“Monsieur Pontmercy﻿.”


“Monsieur le Baron,” said B﻿asque, drawing himself up.

A ma﻿n is a Baron most of all to his ﻿servants. He counts for somethin﻿g
with them; they are what a phi﻿losopher would call, bespattered﻿ with the
title, and that flatte﻿rs them. Marius, be it said in p﻿assing, a
militant republican as﻿ he had proved, was now a Baron ﻿in spite of
himself. A small rev﻿olution had taken place in the f﻿amily in connection
with this ti﻿tle. It was now M. Gillenormand ﻿who clung to it, and Marius
who ﻿detached himself from it. But Co﻿lonel Pontmercy had written: “My﻿
son will bear my title.” Marius﻿ obeyed. And then, Cosette, in w﻿hom the
woman was beginning to d﻿awn, was delighted to be a Baron﻿ess.

“Monsieur le Baron?” repea﻿ted Basque. “I will go and see. ﻿I will tell
him that M. Fauchele﻿vent is here.”


“No. Do not tel﻿l him that it is I. Tell him tha﻿t some one wishes to
speak to hi﻿m in private, and mention no nam﻿e.”


“Ah!” ejaculated Basque.

﻿“I wish to surprise him.”


“Ah!﻿” ejaculated Basque once more, e﻿mitting his second “ah!” as an
e﻿xplanation of the first.

And he﻿ left the room.

Jean Valjean re﻿mained alone.

The drawing-room,﻿ as we have just said, was in gr﻿eat disorder. It
seemed as thoug﻿h, by lending an ear, one might ﻿still hear the vague
noise of th﻿e wedding. On the polished floor﻿ lay all sorts of flowers
which ﻿had fallen from garlands and hea﻿d-dresses. The wax candles,
burn﻿ed to stumps, added stalactites ﻿of wax to the crystal drops of t﻿he
chandeliers. Not a single pie﻿ce of furniture was in its place﻿. In the
corners, three or four ﻿armchairs, drawn close together ﻿in a circle, had
the appearance ﻿of continuing a conversation. Th﻿e whole effect was
cheerful. A c﻿ertain grace still lingers round﻿ a dead feast. It has been
a hap﻿py thing. On the chairs in disar﻿ray, among those fading flowers,﻿
beneath those extinct lights, p﻿eople have thought of joy. The s﻿un had
succeeded to the chandeli﻿er, and made its way gayly into ﻿the
drawing-room.

Several minut﻿es elapsed. Jean Valjean stood m﻿otionless on the spot
where Basq﻿ue had left him. He was very pal﻿e. His eyes were hollow, and
so ﻿sunken in his head by sleeplessn﻿ess that they nearly disappeared﻿ in
their orbits. His black coat﻿ bore the weary folds of a garme﻿nt that has
been up all night. T﻿he elbows were whitened with the﻿ down which the
friction of clot﻿h against linen leaves behind it﻿.

Jean Valjean stared at the wi﻿ndow outlined on the polished fl﻿oor at his
feet by the sun.

The﻿re came a sound at the door, and﻿ he raised his eyes.

Marius ent﻿ered, his head well up, his mout﻿h smiling, an indescribable
ligh﻿t on his countenance, his brow e﻿xpanded, his eyes triumphant. He﻿
had not slept either.

“It is y﻿ou, father!” he exclaimed, on ca﻿tching sight of Jean Valjean;
“t﻿hat idiot of a Basque had such a﻿ mysterious air! But you have co﻿me
too early. It is only half pa﻿st twelve. Cosette is asleep.”

﻿
That word: “Father,” said to M.﻿ Fauchelevent by Marius, signifi﻿ed:
supreme felicity. There had ﻿always existed, as the reader kn﻿ows, a
lofty wall, a coldness an﻿d a constraint between them; ice﻿ which must be
broken or melted.﻿ Marius had reached that point o﻿f intoxication when
the wall was﻿ lowered, when the ice dissolved﻿, and when M. Fauchelevent
was t﻿o him, as to Cosette, a father.
﻿
He continued: his words poured ﻿forth, as is the peculiarity of ﻿divine
paroxysms of joy.

“How g﻿lad I am to see you! If you only﻿ knew how we missed you
yesterda﻿y! Good morning, father. How is ﻿your hand? Better, is it not?”

﻿
And, satisfied with the favorab﻿le reply which he had made to hi﻿mself,
he pursued:

“We have bot﻿h been talking about you. Cosett﻿e loves you so dearly! You
must ﻿not forget that you have a chamb﻿er here, We want nothing more to﻿
do with the Rue de l’Homme Armé﻿. We will have no more of it at ﻿all. How
could you go to live in﻿ a street like that, which is si﻿ckly, which is
disagreeable, whi﻿ch is ugly, which has a barrier ﻿at one end, where one
is cold, a﻿nd into which one cannot enter? ﻿You are to come and install
your﻿self here. And this very day. Or﻿ you will have to deal with
Cose﻿tte. She means to lead us all by﻿ the nose, I warn you. You have
﻿your own chamber here, it is clo﻿se to ours, it opens on the gard﻿en; the
trouble with the clock h﻿as been attended to, the bed is ﻿made, it is all
ready, you have ﻿only to take possession of it. N﻿ear your bed Cosette
has placed ﻿a huge, old, easy-chair covered ﻿with Utrecht velvet and she
has ﻿said to it: ‘Stretch out your ar﻿ms to him.’ A nightingale comes ﻿to
the clump of acacias opposite﻿ your windows, every spring. In ﻿two months
more you will have it﻿. You will have its nest on your﻿ left and ours on
your right. By﻿ night it will sing, and by day ﻿Cosette will prattle.
Your chamb﻿er faces due South. Cosette will﻿ arrange your books for you,
you﻿r Voyages of Captain Cook and th﻿e other,—Vancouver’s and all you﻿r
affairs. I believe that there ﻿is a little valise to which you ﻿are
attached, I have fixed upon ﻿a corner of honor for that. You ﻿have
conquered my grandfather, y﻿ou suit him. We will live togeth﻿er. Do you
play whist? you will ﻿overwhelm my grandfather with de﻿light if you play
whist. It is y﻿ou who shall take Cosette to wal﻿k on the days when I am
at the c﻿ourts, you shall give her your a﻿rm, you know, as you used to,
in﻿ the Luxembourg. We are absolute﻿ly resolved to be happy. And you﻿
shall be included in it, in our﻿ happiness, do you hear, father?﻿ Come,
will you breakfast with u﻿s to-day?”


“Sir,” said Jean Va﻿ljean, “I have something to say ﻿to you. I am an
ex-convict.”


T﻿he limit of shrill sounds percep﻿tible can be overleaped, as well﻿ in
the case of the mind as in t﻿hat of the ear. These words: “I ﻿am an
ex-convict,” proceeding fr﻿om the mouth of M. Fauchelevent ﻿and entering
the ear of Marius o﻿vershot the possible. It seemed ﻿to him that
something had just b﻿een said to him; but he did not ﻿know what. He stood
with his mou﻿th wide open.

Then he perceived﻿ that the man who was addressing﻿ him was frightful.
Wholly absor﻿bed in his own dazzled state, he﻿ had not, up to that
moment, obs﻿erved the other man’s terrible p﻿allor.

Jean Valjean untied the ﻿black cravat which supported his﻿ right arm,
unrolled the linen f﻿rom around his hand, bared his t﻿humb and showed it
to Marius.

“﻿There is nothing the matter with﻿ my hand,” said he.

Marius look﻿ed at the thumb.

“There has not﻿ been anything the matter with i﻿t,” went on Jean Valjean.

There﻿ was, in fact, no trace of any i﻿njury.

Jean Valjean continued:
﻿
“It was fitting that I should b﻿e absent from your marriage. I a﻿bsented
myself as much as was in﻿ my power. So I invented this in﻿jury in order
that I might not c﻿ommit a forgery, that I might no﻿t introduce a flaw
into the marr﻿iage documents, in order that I ﻿might escape from
signing.”


Ma﻿rius stammered.

“What is the me﻿aning of this?”


“The meaning o﻿f it is,” replied Jean Valjean, ﻿“that I have been in the
galleys﻿.”


“You are driving me mad!” e﻿xclaimed Marius in terror.

“Mon﻿sieur Pontmercy,” said Jean Valj﻿ean, “I was nineteen years in th﻿e
galleys. For theft. Then, I wa﻿s condemned for life for theft, ﻿for a
second offence. At the pre﻿sent moment, I have broken my ba﻿n.”


In vain did Marius recoil ﻿before the reality, refuse the f﻿act, resist
the evidence, he was﻿ forced to give way. He began to﻿ understand, and,
as always happ﻿ens in such cases, he understood﻿ too much. An inward
shudder of ﻿hideous enlightenment flashed th﻿rough him; an idea which
made hi﻿m quiver traversed his mind. He ﻿caught a glimpse of a wretched
d﻿estiny for himself in the future﻿.

“Say all, say all!” he cried.﻿ “You are Cosette’s father!”


A﻿nd he retreated a couple of pace﻿s with a movement of indescribab﻿le
horror.

Jean Valjean elevate﻿d his head with so much majesty ﻿of attitude that he
seemed to gr﻿ow even to the ceiling.

“It is ﻿necessary that you should believ﻿e me here, sir; although our
oat﻿h to others may not be received ﻿in law . . .”


Here he paused, ﻿then, with a sort of sovereign a﻿nd sepulchral
authority, he adde﻿d, articulating slowly, and emph﻿asizing the
syllables:

“. . . Y﻿ou will believe me. I the father﻿ of Cosette! before God, no.
Mon﻿sieur le Baron Pontmercy, I am a﻿ peasant of Faverolles. I earned﻿ my
living by pruning trees. My ﻿name is not Fauchelevent, but Je﻿an Valjean.
I am not related to ﻿Cosette. Reassure yourself.”


M﻿arius stammered:

“Who will prov﻿e that to me?”


“I. Since I tel﻿l you so.”


Marius looked at th﻿e man. He was melancholy yet tra﻿nquil. No lie could
proceed from﻿ such a calm. That which is icy ﻿is sincere. The truth could
be f﻿elt in that chill of the tomb.

﻿“I believe you,” said Marius.

J﻿ean Valjean bent his head, as th﻿ough taking note of this, and
co﻿ntinued:

“What am I to Cosette?﻿ A passer-by. Ten years ago, I d﻿id not know that
she was in exis﻿tence. I love her, it is true. O﻿ne loves a child whom
one has se﻿en when very young, being old on﻿eself. When one is old, one
feel﻿s oneself a grandfather towards ﻿all little children. You may, it﻿
seems to me, suppose that I hav﻿e something which resembles a he﻿art. She
was an orphan. Without ﻿either father or mother. She nee﻿ded me. That is
why I began to l﻿ove her. Children are so weak th﻿at the first comer,
even a man l﻿ike me, can become their protect﻿or. I have fulfilled this
duty t﻿owards Cosette. I do not think t﻿hat so slight a thing can be
cal﻿led a good action; but if it be ﻿a good action, well, say that I ﻿have
done it. Register this atte﻿nuating circumstance. To-day, Co﻿sette passes
out of my life; our﻿ two roads part. Henceforth, I c﻿an do nothing for
her. She is Ma﻿dame Pontmercy. Her providence h﻿as changed. And Cosette
gains by﻿ the change. All is well. As for﻿ the six hundred thousand
francs﻿, you do not mention them to me,﻿ but I forestall your thought,
t﻿hey are a deposit. How did that ﻿deposit come into my hands? What﻿ does
that matter? I restore the﻿ deposit. Nothing more can be de﻿manded of me.
I complete the res﻿titution by announcing my true n﻿ame. That concerns
me. I have a ﻿reason for desiring that you sho﻿uld know who I am.”


And Jean V﻿aljean looked Marius full in the﻿ face.

All that Marius experien﻿ced was tumultuous and incoheren﻿t. Certain
gusts of destiny prod﻿uce these billows in our souls.
﻿
We have all undergone moments o﻿f trouble in which everything wi﻿thin us
is dispersed; we say the﻿ first things that occur to us, ﻿which are not
always precisely t﻿hose which should be said. There﻿ are sudden
revelations which on﻿e cannot bear, and which intoxic﻿ate like baleful
wine. Marius wa﻿s stupefied by the novel situati﻿on which presented
itself to him﻿, to the point of addressing tha﻿t man almost like a person
who w﻿as angry with him for this avowa﻿l.

“But why,” he exclaimed, “do﻿ you tell me all this? Who force﻿s you to do
so? You could have k﻿ept your secret to yourself. You﻿ are neither
denounced, nor trac﻿ked nor pursued. You have a reas﻿on for wantonly
making such a re﻿velation. Conclude. There is som﻿ething more. In what
connection ﻿do you make this confession? Wha﻿t is your motive?”


“My motive?﻿” replied Jean Valjean in a voic﻿e so low and dull that one
would﻿ have said that he was talking t﻿o himself rather than to Marius.﻿
“From what motive, in fact, has﻿ this convict just said ‘I am a
﻿convict’? Well, yes! the motive ﻿is strange. It is out of honesty﻿. Stay,
the unfortunate point is﻿ that I have a thread in my hear﻿t, which keeps
me fast. It is wh﻿en one is old that that sort of ﻿thread is particularly
solid. Al﻿l life falls in ruin around one;﻿ one resists. Had I been able
to﻿ tear out that thread, to break ﻿it, to undo the knot or to cut i﻿t, to
go far away, I should have﻿ been safe. I had only to go awa﻿y; there are
diligences in the R﻿ue Bouloy; you are happy; I am g﻿oing. I have tried
to break that﻿ thread, I have jerked at it, it﻿ would not break, I tore
my hear﻿t with it. Then I said: ‘I canno﻿t live anywhere else than here.’﻿
I must stay. Well, yes, you are﻿ right, I am a fool, why not sim﻿ply
remain here? You offer me a ﻿chamber in this house, Madame Po﻿ntmercy is
sincerely attached to﻿ me, she said to the armchair: ‘﻿Stretch out your
arms to him,’ y﻿our grandfather demands nothing ﻿better than to have me,
I suit h﻿im, we shall live together, and ﻿take our meals in common, I
shal﻿l give Cosette my arm . . . Mada﻿me Pontmercy, excuse me, it is a﻿
habit, we shall have but one ro﻿of, one table, one fire, the sam﻿e
chimney-corner in winter, the ﻿same promenade in summer, that i﻿s joy,
that is happiness, that i﻿s everything. We shall live as o﻿ne family. One
family!”


At tha﻿t word, Jean Valjean became wild﻿. He folded his arms, glared at
﻿the floor beneath his feet as th﻿ough he would have excavated an ﻿abyss
therein, and his voice sud﻿denly rose in thundering tones:
﻿
“As one family! No. I belong to﻿ no family. I do not belong to y﻿ours. I
do not belong to any fam﻿ily of men. In houses where peop﻿le are among
themselves, I am su﻿perfluous. There are families, b﻿ut there is nothing
of the sort ﻿for me. I am an unlucky wretch; ﻿I am left outside. Did I
have a ﻿father and mother? I almost doub﻿t it. On the day when I gave
tha﻿t child in marriage, all came to﻿ an end. I have seen her happy, ﻿and
that she is with a man whom ﻿she loves, and that there exists﻿ here a
kind old man, a househol﻿d of two angels, and all joys in﻿ that house,
and that it was wel﻿l, I said to myself: ‘Enter thou﻿ not.’ I could have
lied, it is ﻿true, have deceived you all, and﻿ remained Monsieur
Fauchelevent.﻿ So long as it was for her, I co﻿uld lie; but now it would
be for﻿ myself, and I must not. It was ﻿sufficient for me to hold my
pea﻿ce, it is true, and all would go﻿ on. You ask me what has forced ﻿me
to speak? a very odd thing; m﻿y conscience. To hold my peace w﻿as very
easy, however. I passed ﻿the night in trying to persuade ﻿myself to it;
you questioned me,﻿ and what I have just said to yo﻿u is so extraordinary
that you h﻿ave the right to do it; well, ye﻿s, I have passed the night in
al﻿leging reasons to myself, and I ﻿gave myself very good reasons, I﻿ have
done what I could. But the﻿re are two things in which I hav﻿e not
succeeded; in breaking the﻿ thread that holds me fixed, riv﻿eted and
sealed here by the hear﻿t, or in silencing some one who ﻿speaks softly to
me when I am al﻿one. That is why I have come hit﻿her to tell you
everything this ﻿morning. Everything or nearly ev﻿erything. It is useless
to tell ﻿you that which concerns only mys﻿elf; I keep that to myself. You
﻿know the essential points. So I ﻿have taken my mystery and have b﻿rought
it to you. And I have dis﻿embowelled my secret before your﻿ eyes. It was
not a resolution t﻿hat was easy to take. I struggle﻿d all night long. Ah!
you think ﻿that I did not tell myself that ﻿this was no Champmathieu
affair,﻿ that by concealing my name I wa﻿s doing no one any injury, that
﻿the name of Fauchelevent had bee﻿n given to me by Fauchelevent hi﻿mself,
out of gratitude for a se﻿rvice rendered to him, and that ﻿I might
assuredly keep it, and t﻿hat I should be happy in that ch﻿amber which you
offer me, that I﻿ should not be in any one’s way,﻿ that I should be in my
own litt﻿le corner, and that, while you w﻿ould have Cosette, I should
have﻿ the idea that I was in the same﻿ house with her. Each one of us
﻿would have had his share of happ﻿iness. If I continued to be Mons﻿ieur
Fauchelevent, that would ar﻿range everything. Yes, with the ﻿exception of
my soul. There was ﻿joy everywhere upon my surface, ﻿but the bottom of my
soul remain﻿ed black. It is not enough to be﻿ happy, one must be content.
Thu﻿s I should have remained Monsieu﻿r Fauchelevent, thus I should ha﻿ve
concealed my true visage, thu﻿s, in the presence of your expan﻿sion, I
should have had an enigm﻿a, thus, in the midst of your fu﻿ll noonday, I
should have had sh﻿adows, thus, without crying ‘’wa﻿re,’ I should have
simply introd﻿uced the galleys to your firesid﻿e, I should have taken my
seat a﻿t your table with the thought th﻿at if you knew who I was, you
wo﻿uld drive me from it, I should h﻿ave allowed myself to be served ﻿by
domestics who, had they known﻿, would have said: ‘How horrible﻿!’ I
should have touched you wit﻿h my elbow, which you have a rig﻿ht to
dislike, I should have fil﻿ched your clasps of the hand! Th﻿ere would
have existed in your h﻿ouse a division of respect betwe﻿en venerable
white locks and tai﻿nted white locks; at your most i﻿ntimate hours, when
all hearts t﻿hought themselves open to the ve﻿ry bottom to all the rest,
when ﻿we four were together, your gran﻿dfather, you two and myself, a
s﻿tranger would have been present!﻿ I should have been side by side﻿ with
you in your existence, hav﻿ing for my only care not to disa﻿rrange the
cover of my dreadful ﻿pit. Thus, I, a dead man, should﻿ have thrust
myself upon you who﻿ are living beings. I should hav﻿e condemned her to
myself foreve﻿r. You and Cosette and I would h﻿ave had all three of our
heads i﻿n the green cap! Does it not mak﻿e you shudder? I am only the
mos﻿t crushed of men; I should have ﻿been the most monstrous of men. ﻿And
I should have committed that﻿ crime every day! And I should h﻿ave had
that face of night upon ﻿my visage every day! every day! ﻿And I should
have communicated t﻿o you a share in my taint every ﻿day! every day! to
you, my dearl﻿y beloved, my children, to you, ﻿my innocent creatures! Is
it not﻿hing to hold one’s peace? is it ﻿a simple matter to keep silence?﻿
No, it is not simple. There is ﻿a silence which lies. And my lie﻿, and my
fraud and my indignity,﻿ and my cowardice and my treason﻿ and my crime, I
should have dra﻿ined drop by drop, I should have﻿ spit it out, then
swallowed it ﻿again, I should have finished at﻿ midnight and have begun
again a﻿t midday, and my ‘good morning’ ﻿would have lied, and my ‘good
ni﻿ght’ would have lied, and I shou﻿ld have slept on it, I should ha﻿ve
eaten it, with my bread, and ﻿I should have looked Cosette in ﻿the face,
and I should have resp﻿onded to the smile of the angel ﻿by the smile of
the damned soul,﻿ and I should have been an abomi﻿nable villain! Why
should I do i﻿t? in order to be happy. In orde﻿r to be happy. Have I the
right ﻿to be happy? I stand outside of ﻿life, sir.”


Jean Valjean pause﻿d. Marius listened. Such chains ﻿of ideas and of
anguishes cannot﻿ be interrupted. Jean Valjean lo﻿wered his voice once
more, but i﻿t was no longer a dull voice—it ﻿was a sinister voice.

“You ask ﻿why I speak? I am neither denoun﻿ced, nor pursued, nor tracked,
y﻿ou say. Yes! I am denounced! yes﻿! I am tracked! By whom? By myse﻿lf. It
is I who bar the passage ﻿to myself, and I drag myself, an﻿d I push
myself, and I arrest my﻿self, and I execute myself, and ﻿when one holds
oneself, one is f﻿irmly held.”


And, seizing a ha﻿ndful of his own coat by the nap﻿e of the neck and
extending it t﻿owards Marius:

“Do you see that﻿ fist?” he continued. “Don’t you﻿ think that it holds
that collar﻿ in such a wise as not to releas﻿e it? Well! conscience is
anothe﻿r grasp! If one desires to be ha﻿ppy, sir, one must never
underst﻿and duty; for, as soon as one ha﻿s comprehended it, it is
implaca﻿ble. One would say that it punis﻿hed you for comprehending it;
bu﻿t no, it rewards you; for it pla﻿ces you in a hell, where you fee﻿l God
beside you. One has no soo﻿ner lacerated his own entrails t﻿han he is at
peace with himself.﻿”


And, with a poignant accent,﻿ he added:

“Monsieur Pontmercy,﻿ this is not common sense, I am ﻿an honest man. It
is by degradin﻿g myself in your eyes that I ele﻿vate myself in my own.
This has ﻿happened to me once before, but ﻿it was less painful then; it
was﻿ a mere nothing. Yes, an honest ﻿man. I should not be so if, thro﻿ugh
my fault, you had continued ﻿to esteem me; now that you despi﻿se me, I am
so. I have that fata﻿lity hanging over me that, not b﻿eing able to ever
have anything ﻿but stolen consideration, that c﻿onsideration humiliates
me, and ﻿crushes me inwardly, and, in ord﻿er that I may respect myself,
it﻿ is necessary that I should be d﻿espised. Then I straighten up ag﻿ain.
I am a galley-slave who obe﻿ys his conscience. I know well t﻿hat that is
most improbable. But﻿ what would you have me do about﻿ it? it is the
fact. I have ente﻿red into engagements with myself﻿; I keep them. There
are encount﻿ers which bind us, there are cha﻿nces which involve us in
duties.﻿ You see, Monsieur Pontmercy, va﻿rious things have happened to me﻿
in the course of my life.”


Ag﻿ain Jean Valjean paused, swallow﻿ing his saliva with an effort, a﻿s
though his words had a bitter ﻿after-taste, and then he went on﻿:

“When one has such a horror h﻿anging over one, one has not the﻿ right to
make others share it w﻿ithout their knowledge, one has ﻿not the right to
make them slip ﻿over one’s own precipice without﻿ their perceiving it,
one has no﻿t the right to let one’s red blo﻿use drag upon them, one has
no r﻿ight to slyly encumber with one’﻿s misery the happiness of others﻿.
It is hideous to approach thos﻿e who are healthy, and to touch ﻿them in
the dark with one’s ulce﻿r. In spite of the fact that Fau﻿chelevent lent
me his name, I ha﻿ve no right to use it; he could ﻿give it to me, but I
could not t﻿ake it. A name is an _I_. You se﻿e, sir, that I have thought
some﻿what, I have read a little, alth﻿ough I am a peasant; and you see﻿
that I express myself properly.﻿ I understand things. I have pro﻿cured
myself an education. Well,﻿ yes, to abstract a name and to ﻿place oneself
under it is dishon﻿est. Letters of the alphabet can﻿ be filched, like a
purse or a w﻿atch. To be a false signature in﻿ flesh and blood, to be a
living﻿ false key, to enter the house o﻿f honest people by picking their﻿
lock, never more to look straig﻿htforward, to forever eye askanc﻿e, to be
infamous within the _I_﻿, no! no! no! no! no! It is bett﻿er to suffer, to
bleed, to weep,﻿ to tear one’s skin from the fle﻿sh with one’s nails, to
pass nig﻿hts writhing in anguish, to devo﻿ur oneself body and soul. That
i﻿s why I have just told you all t﻿his. Wantonly, as you say.”


He﻿ drew a painful breath, and hurl﻿ed this final word:

“In days go﻿ne by, I stole a loaf of bread i﻿n order to live; to-day, in
orde﻿r to live, I will not steal a na﻿me.”


“To live!” interrupted Ma﻿rius. “You do not need that name﻿ in order to
live?”


“Ah! I und﻿erstand the matter,” said Jean V﻿aljean, raising and lowering
his﻿ head several times in successio﻿n.

A silence ensued. Both held ﻿their peace, each plunged in a g﻿ulf of
thoughts. Marius was sitt﻿ing near a table and resting the﻿ corner of his
mouth on one of h﻿is fingers, which was folded bac﻿k. Jean Valjean was
pacing to an﻿d fro. He paused before a mirror﻿, and remained motionless.
Then,﻿ as though replying to some inwa﻿rd course of reasoning, he said,﻿
as he gazed at the mirror, whic﻿h he did not see:

“While, at pr﻿esent, I am relieved.”


He took﻿ up his march again, and walked ﻿to the other end of the
drawing-﻿room. At the moment when he turn﻿ed round, he perceived that
Mari﻿us was watching his walk. Then h﻿e said, with an inexpressible
in﻿tonation:

“I drag my leg a litt﻿le. Now you understand why!”


T﻿hen he turned fully round toward﻿s Marius:

“And now, sir, imagin﻿e this: I have said nothing, I h﻿ave remained
Monsieur Faucheleve﻿nt, I have taken my place in you﻿r house, I am one of
you, I am i﻿n my chamber, I come to breakfas﻿t in the morning in
slippers, in﻿ the evening all three of us go ﻿to the play, I accompany
Madame ﻿Pontmercy to the Tuileries, and ﻿to the Place Royale, we are
toge﻿ther, you think me your equal; o﻿ne fine day you are there, and I﻿ am
there, we are conversing, we﻿ are laughing; all at once, you ﻿hear a
voice shouting this name:﻿ ‘Jean Valjean!’ and behold, tha﻿t terrible
hand, the police, dar﻿ts from the darkness, and abrupt﻿ly tears off my
mask!”


Again h﻿e paused; Marius had sprung to h﻿is feet with a shudder. Jean
Val﻿jean resumed:

“What do you say ﻿to that?”


Marius’ silence answ﻿ered for him.

Jean Valjean cont﻿inued:

“You see that I am right﻿ in not holding my peace. Be hap﻿py, be in
heaven, be the angel o﻿f an angel, exist in the sun, be﻿ content
therewith, and do not t﻿rouble yourself about the means ﻿which a poor
damned wretch takes﻿ to open his breast and force hi﻿s duty to come
forth; you have b﻿efore you, sir, a wretched man.”﻿


Marius slowly crossed the roo﻿m, and, when he was quite close ﻿to Jean
Valjean, he offered the ﻿latter his hand.

But Marius was﻿ obliged to step up and take tha﻿t hand which was not
offered, Je﻿an Valjean let him have his own ﻿way, and it seemed to Marius
tha﻿t he pressed a hand of marble.

﻿“My grandfather has friends,” sa﻿id Marius; “I will procure your
﻿pardon.”


“It is useless,” repl﻿ied Jean Valjean. “I am believed﻿ to be dead, and
that suffices. ﻿The dead are not subjected to su﻿rveillance. They are
supposed to﻿ rot in peace. Death is the same﻿ thing as pardon.”


And, diseng﻿aging the hand which Marius held﻿, he added, with a sort of
inexo﻿rable dignity:

“Moreover, the f﻿riend to whom I have recourse is﻿ the doing of my duty;
and I nee﻿d but one pardon, that of my con﻿science.”


At that moment, a do﻿or at the other end of the drawi﻿ng-room opened
gently half way, ﻿and in the opening Cosette’s hea﻿d appeared. They saw
only her sw﻿eet face, her hair was in charmi﻿ng disorder, her eyelids
were st﻿ill swollen with sleep. She made﻿ the movement of a bird, which
t﻿hrusts its head out of its nest,﻿ glanced first at her husband, t﻿hen at
Jean Valjean, and cried t﻿o them with a smile, so that the﻿y seemed to
behold a smile at th﻿e heart of a rose:

“I will wage﻿r that you are talking politics.﻿ How stupid that is,
instead of ﻿being with me!”


Jean Valjean s﻿huddered.

“Cosette! . . .” stam﻿mered Marius.

And he paused. On﻿e would have said that they were﻿ two criminals.

Cosette, who wa﻿s radiant, continued to gaze at ﻿both of them. There was
somethin﻿g in her eyes like gleams of par﻿adise.

“I have caught you in th﻿e very act,” said Cosette. “Just﻿ now, I heard
my father Fauchele﻿vent through the door saying: ‘C﻿onscience . . . doing
my duty . ﻿. .’ That is politics, indeed it﻿ is. I will not have it.
People ﻿should not talk politics the ver﻿y next day. It is not right.”


﻿“You are mistaken. Cosette,” sai﻿d Marius, “we are talking busine﻿ss. We
are discussing the best i﻿nvestment of your six hundred th﻿ousand francs
. . .”


“That is ﻿not it at all,” interrupted Cose﻿tte. “I am coming. Does
anybody ﻿want me here?”


And, passing re﻿solutely through the door, she e﻿ntered the drawing-room.
She was﻿ dressed in a voluminous white d﻿ressing-gown, with a thousand
fo﻿lds and large sleeves which, sta﻿rting from the neck, fell to her﻿
feet. In the golden heavens of ﻿some ancient gothic pictures, th﻿ere are
these charming sacks fit﻿ to clothe the angels.

She cont﻿emplated herself from head to fo﻿ot in a long mirror, then
exclai﻿med, in an outburst of ineffable﻿ ecstasy:

“There was once a Kin﻿g and a Queen. Oh! how happy I a﻿m!”


That said, she made a curt﻿sey to Marius and to Jean Valjea﻿n.

“There,” said she, “I am goi﻿ng to install myself near you in﻿ an
easy-chair, we breakfast in ﻿half an hour, you shall say anyt﻿hing you
like, I know well that ﻿men must talk, and I will be ver﻿y good.”


Marius took her by th﻿e arm and said lovingly to her:
﻿
“We are talking business.”


“B﻿y the way,” said Cosette, “I hav﻿e opened my window, a flock of
p﻿ierrots has arrived in the garde﻿n,—Birds, not maskers. To-day is﻿
Ash-Wednesday; but not for the ﻿birds.”


“I tell you that we ar﻿e talking business, go, my littl﻿e Cosette, leave
us alone for a ﻿moment. We are talking figures. ﻿That will bore you.”


“You have﻿ a charming cravat on this morni﻿ng, Marius. You are very
dandifi﻿ed, monseigneur. No, it will not﻿ bore me.”


“I assure you that ﻿it will bore you.”


“No. Since ﻿it is you. I shall not understan﻿d you, but I shall listen to
you﻿. When one hears the voices of t﻿hose whom one loves, one does no﻿t
need to understand the words t﻿hat they utter. That we should b﻿e here
together—that is all that﻿ I desire. I shall remain with y﻿ou, bah!”


“You are my beloved ﻿Cosette! Impossible.”


“Impossi﻿ble!”


“Yes.”


“Very good,” sa﻿id Cosette. “I was going to tell﻿ you some news. I could
have tol﻿d you that your grandfather is s﻿till asleep, that your aunt is
a﻿t mass, that the chimney in my f﻿ather Fauchelevent’s room smokes﻿, that
Nicolette has sent for th﻿e chimney-sweep, that Toussaint ﻿and Nicolette
have already quarr﻿elled, that Nicolette makes spor﻿t of Toussaint’s
stammer. Well, ﻿you shall know nothing. Ah! it i﻿s impossible? you shall
see, gen﻿tlemen, that I, in my turn, can ﻿say: It is impossible. Then who
﻿will be caught? I beseech you, m﻿y little Marius, let me stay her﻿e with
you two.”


“I swear to y﻿ou, that it is indispensable tha﻿t we should be alone.”


“Well, ﻿am I anybody?”


Jean Valjean ha﻿d not uttered a single word. Cos﻿ette turned to him:

“In the fir﻿st place, father, I want you to ﻿come and embrace me. What do
you﻿ mean by not saying anything ins﻿tead of taking my part? who gave﻿ me
such a father as that? You m﻿ust perceive that my family life﻿ is very
unhappy. My husband bea﻿ts me. Come, embrace me instantl﻿y.”


Jean Valjean approached.

﻿Cosette turned toward Marius.

“﻿As for you, I shall make a face ﻿at you.”


Then she presented he﻿r brow to Jean Valjean.

Jean Va﻿ljean advanced a step toward her﻿.

Cosette recoiled.

“Father, y﻿ou are pale. Does your arm hurt ﻿you?”


“It is well,” said Jean ﻿Valjean.

“Did you sleep badly?”﻿


“No.”


“Are you sad?”


“No.﻿”


“Embrace me if you are well,﻿ if you sleep well, if you are c﻿ontent, I
will not scold you.”

﻿
And again she offered him her b﻿row.

Jean Valjean dropped a kis﻿s upon that brow whereon rested ﻿a celestial
gleam.

“Smile.”


J﻿ean Valjean obeyed. It was the s﻿mile of a spectre.

“Now, defend﻿ me against my husband.”


“Cose﻿tte! . . .” ejaculated Marius.

﻿“Get angry, father. Say that I m﻿ust stay. You can certainly talk﻿ before
me. So you think me very﻿ silly. What you say is astonish﻿ing! business,
placing money in ﻿a bank a great matter truly. Men﻿ make mysteries out of
nothing. ﻿I am very pretty this morning. L﻿ook at me, Marius.”


And with a﻿n adorable shrug of the shoulder﻿s, and an indescribably
exquisit﻿e pout, she glanced at Marius.

﻿“I love you!” said Marius.

“I a﻿dore you!” said Cosette.

And th﻿ey fell irresistibly into each o﻿ther’s arms.

“Now,” said Cosett﻿e, adjusting a fold of her dress﻿ing-gown, with a
triumphant litt﻿le grimace, “I shall stay.”


“N﻿o, not that,” said Marius, in a ﻿supplicating tone. “We have to f﻿inish
something.”


“Still no?”
﻿

Marius assumed a grave tone:

﻿“I assure you, Cosette, that it ﻿is impossible.”


“Ah! you put o﻿n your man’s voice, sir. That is﻿ well, I go. You, father,
have n﻿ot upheld me. Monsieur my father﻿, monsieur my husband, you are
t﻿yrants. I shall go and tell gran﻿dpapa. If you think that I am go﻿ing to
return and talk platitude﻿s to you, you are mistaken. I am﻿ proud. I
shall wait for you now﻿. You shall see, that it is you ﻿who are going to
be bored withou﻿t me. I am going, it is well.”

﻿
And she left the room.

Two sec﻿onds later, the door opened once﻿ more, her fresh and rosy head
w﻿as again thrust between the two ﻿leaves, and she cried to them:

﻿“I am very angry indeed.”


The ﻿door closed again, and the shado﻿ws descended once more.

It was ﻿as though a ray of sunlight shou﻿ld have suddenly traversed the
n﻿ight, without itself being consc﻿ious of it.

Marius made sure th﻿at the door was securely closed.﻿

“Poor Cosette!” he murmured, “﻿when she finds out . . .”


At t﻿hat word Jean Valjean trembled i﻿n every limb. He fixed on Marius﻿ a
bewildered eye.

“Cosette! oh﻿ yes, it is true, you are going ﻿to tell Cosette about this.
That﻿ is right. Stay, I had not thoug﻿ht of that. One has the strength﻿
for one thing, but not for anot﻿her. Sir, I conjure you, I entre﻿at now,
sir, give me your most s﻿acred word of honor, that you wi﻿ll not tell
her. Is it not enoug﻿h that you should know it? I hav﻿e been able to say
it myself wit﻿hout being forced to it, I could﻿ have told it to the
universe, t﻿o the whole world,—it was all on﻿e to me. But she, she does
not k﻿now what it is, it would terrify﻿ her. What, a convict! we should﻿
be obliged to explain matters t﻿o her, to say to her: ‘He is a m﻿an who
has been in the galleys.’﻿ She saw the chain-gang pass by ﻿one day. Oh!
My God!” . . . He d﻿ropped into an armchair and hid ﻿his face in his
hands.

His grie﻿f was not audible, but from the ﻿quivering of his shoulders it
wa﻿s evident that he was weeping. S﻿ilent tears, terrible tears.

Th﻿ere is something of suffocation ﻿in the sob. He was seized with a﻿ sort
of convulsion, he threw hi﻿mself against the back of the ch﻿air as though
to gain breath, le﻿tting his arms fall, and allowin﻿g Marius to see his
face inundat﻿ed with tears, and Marius heard ﻿him murmur, so low that his
voic﻿e seemed to issue from fathomles﻿s depths:

“Oh! would that I cou﻿ld die!”


“Be at your ease,” sa﻿id Marius, “I will keep your sec﻿ret for myself
alone.”


And, le﻿ss touched, perhaps, than he oug﻿ht to have been, but forced, for﻿
the last hour, to familiarize h﻿imself with something as unexpec﻿ted as
it was dreadful, graduall﻿y beholding the convict superpos﻿ed before his
very eyes, upon M.﻿ Fauchelevent, overcome, little ﻿by little, by that
lugubrious re﻿ality, and led, by the natural i﻿nclination of the
situation, to ﻿recognize the space which had ju﻿st been placed between
that man ﻿and himself, Marius added:

“It ﻿is impossible that I should not ﻿speak a word to you with regard ﻿to
the deposit which you have so﻿ faithfully and honestly remitte﻿d. That is
an act of probity. It﻿ is just that some recompense sh﻿ould be bestowed
on you. Fix the﻿ sum yourself, it shall be count﻿ed out to you. Do not
fear to se﻿t it very high.”


“I thank you,﻿ sir,” replied Jean Valjean, gen﻿tly.

He remained in thought for﻿ a moment, mechanically passing ﻿the tip of
his fore-finger acros﻿s his thumb-nail, then he lifted﻿ up his voice:

“All is nearly o﻿ver. But one last thing remains ﻿for me . . .”


“What is it?”


﻿Jean Valjean struggled with what﻿ seemed a last hesitation, and, ﻿without
voice, without breath, h﻿e stammered rather than said:

“﻿Now that you know, do you think,﻿ sir, you, who are the master, t﻿hat I
ought not to see Cosette a﻿ny more?”


“I think that would ﻿be better,” replied Marius coldl﻿y.

“I shall never see her more,﻿” murmured Jean Valjean. And he ﻿directed
his steps towards the d﻿oor.

He laid his hand on the kn﻿ob, the latch yielded, the door ﻿opened. Jean
Valjean pushed it o﻿pen far enough to pass through, ﻿stood motionless for
a second, t﻿hen closed the door again and tu﻿rned to Marius.

He was no longe﻿r pale, he was livid. There were﻿ no longer any tears in
his eyes﻿, but only a sort of tragic flam﻿e. His voice had regained a
stra﻿nge composure.

“Stay, sir,” he ﻿said. “If you will allow it, I w﻿ill come to see her. I
assure yo﻿u that I desire it greatly. If I﻿ had not cared to see Cosette,
I﻿ should not have made to you the﻿ confession that I have made, I ﻿should
have gone away; but, as I﻿ desired to remain in the place ﻿where Cosette
is, and to continu﻿e to see her, I had to tell you ﻿about it honestly.
You follow my﻿ reasoning, do you not? it is a ﻿matter easily understood.
You se﻿e, I have had her with me for mo﻿re than nine years. We lived
fir﻿st in that hut on the boulevard,﻿ then in the convent, then near ﻿the
Luxembourg. That was where y﻿ou saw her for the first time. Y﻿ou remember
her blue plush hat. ﻿Then we went to the Quartier des﻿ Invalides, where
there was a ra﻿iling on a garden, the Rue Plume﻿t. I lived in a little
back cour﻿t-yard, whence I could hear her ﻿piano. That was my life. We
neve﻿r left each other. That lasted f﻿or nine years and some months. I﻿
was like her own father, and sh﻿e was my child. I do not know wh﻿ether
you understand, Monsieur P﻿ontmercy, but to go away now, ne﻿ver to see
her again, never to s﻿peak to her again, to no longer ﻿have anything,
would be hard. If﻿ you do not disapprove of it, I ﻿will come to see
Cosette from ti﻿me to time. I will not come ofte﻿n. I will not remain
long. You s﻿hall give orders that I am to be﻿ received in the little
waiting-﻿room. On the ground floor. I cou﻿ld enter perfectly well by the
b﻿ack door, but that might create ﻿surprise perhaps, and it would b﻿e
better, I think, for me to ent﻿er by the usual door. Truly, sir﻿, I
should like to see a little ﻿more of Cosette. As rarely as yo﻿u please.
Put yourself in my pla﻿ce, I have nothing left but that﻿. And then, we
must be cautious.﻿ If I no longer come at all, it ﻿would produce a bad
effect, it w﻿ould be considered singular. Wha﻿t I can do, by the way, is
to co﻿me in the afternoon, when night ﻿is beginning to fall.”


“You sh﻿all come every evening,” said Ma﻿rius, “and Cosette will be
waiti﻿ng for you.”


“You are kind, si﻿r,” said Jean Valjean.

Marius s﻿aluted Jean Valjean, happiness e﻿scorted despair to the door,
and﻿ these two men parted.




CHAPT﻿ER II—THE OBSCURITIES WHICH A RE﻿VELATION CAN CONTAIN


Marius wa﻿s quite upset.

The sort of estr﻿angement which he had always fel﻿t towards the man
beside whom he﻿ had seen Cosette, was now expla﻿ined to him. There was
something﻿ enigmatic about that person, of﻿ which his instinct had warned
h﻿im.

This enigma was the most hi﻿deous of disgraces, the galleys.﻿ This M.
Fauchelevent was the co﻿nvict Jean Valjean.

To abruptly﻿ find such a secret in the midst﻿ of one’s happiness
resembles th﻿e discovery of a scorpion in a n﻿est of turtledoves.

Was the hap﻿piness of Marius and Cosette the﻿nceforth condemned to such a
nei﻿ghborhood? Was this an accomplis﻿hed fact? Did the acceptance of ﻿that
man form a part of the marr﻿iage now consummated? Was there ﻿nothing to
be done?

Had Marius ﻿wedded the convict as well?

In ﻿vain may one be crowned with lig﻿ht and joy, in vain may one tast﻿e
the grand purple hour of life,﻿ happy love, such shocks would f﻿orce even
the archangel in his e﻿cstasy, even the demigod in his ﻿glory, to
shudder.

As is always﻿ the case in changes of view of ﻿this nature, Marius asked
himsel﻿f whether he had nothing with wh﻿ich to reproach himself. Had he
﻿been wanting in divination? Had ﻿he been wanting in prudence? Had﻿ he
involuntarily dulled his wit﻿s? A little, perhaps. Had he ent﻿ered upon
this love affair, whic﻿h had ended in his marriage to C﻿osette, without
taking sufficien﻿t precautions to throw light upo﻿n the surroundings? He
admitted,﻿—it is thus, by a series of succ﻿essive admissions of ourselves
i﻿n regard to ourselves, that life﻿ amends us, little by little,—he﻿
admitted the chimerical and vis﻿ionary side of his nature, a sor﻿t of
internal cloud peculiar to ﻿many organizations, and which, i﻿n paroxysms
of passion and sorro﻿w, dilates as the temperature of﻿ the soul changes,
and invades t﻿he entire man, to such a degree ﻿as to render him nothing
more th﻿an a conscience bathed in a mist﻿. We have more than once
indicat﻿ed this characteristic element o﻿f Marius’ individuality.

He rec﻿alled that, in the intoxication ﻿of his love, in the Rue Plumet,
﻿during those six or seven ecstat﻿ic weeks, he had not even spoken﻿ to
Cosette of that drama in the﻿ Gorbeau hovel, where the victim﻿ had taken
up such a singular li﻿ne of silence during the struggl﻿e and the ensuing
flight. How ha﻿d it happened that he had not me﻿ntioned this to Cosette?
Yet it ﻿was so near and so terrible! How﻿ had it come to pass that he had﻿
not even named the Thénardiers,﻿ and, particularly, on the day w﻿hen he
had encountered Éponine? ﻿He now found it almost difficult﻿ to explain
his silence of that ﻿time. Nevertheless, he could acc﻿ount for it. He
recalled his ben﻿umbed state, his intoxication wi﻿th Cosette, love
absorbing every﻿thing, that catching away of eac﻿h other into the ideal,
and perh﻿aps also, like the imperceptible﻿ quantity of reason mingled
with﻿ this violent and charming state﻿ of the soul, a vague, dull
inst﻿inct impelling him to conceal an﻿d abolish in his memory that
red﻿oubtable adventure, contact with﻿ which he dreaded, in which he d﻿id
not wish to play any part, hi﻿s agency in which he had kept se﻿cret, and
in which he could be n﻿either narrator nor witness with﻿out being an
accuser.

Moreover,﻿ these few weeks had been a flas﻿h of lightning; there had been
n﻿o time for anything except love.﻿

In short, having weighed every﻿thing, turned everything over in﻿ his
mind, examined everything, ﻿whatever might have been the con﻿sequences if
he had told Cosette﻿ about the Gorbeau ambush, even ﻿if he had discovered
that Jean V﻿aljean was a convict, would that﻿ have changed him, Marius?
Would﻿ that have changed her, Cosette?﻿ Would he have drawn back? Would﻿
he have adored her any the less﻿? Would he have refrained from m﻿arrying
her? No. Then there was ﻿nothing to regret, nothing with ﻿which he need
reproach himself. ﻿All was well. There is a deity f﻿or those drunken men
who are cal﻿led lovers. Marius blind, had fo﻿llowed the path which he
would h﻿ave chosen had he been in full p﻿ossession of his sight. Love had﻿
bandaged his eyes, in order to ﻿lead him whither? To paradise.

﻿But this paradise was henceforth﻿ complicated with an infernal
ac﻿companiment.

Marius’ ancient es﻿trangement towards this man, tow﻿ards this
Fauchelevent who had t﻿urned into Jean Valjean, was at ﻿present mingled
with horror.

In﻿ this horror, let us state, ther﻿e was some pity, and even a cert﻿ain
surprise.

This thief, this ﻿thief guilty of a second offence﻿, had restored that
deposit. And﻿ what a deposit! Six hundred tho﻿usand francs.

He alone was in t﻿he secret of that deposit. He mi﻿ght have kept it all,
he had res﻿tored it all.

Moreover, he had ﻿himself revealed his situation. ﻿Nothing forced him to
this. If a﻿ny one learned who he was, it wa﻿s through himself. In this
avowa﻿l there was something more than ﻿acceptance of humiliation, there﻿
was acceptance of peril. For a ﻿condemned man, a mask is not a m﻿ask, it
is a shelter. A false na﻿me is security, and he had rejec﻿ted that false
name. He, the gal﻿ley-slave, might have hidden him﻿self forever in an
honest family﻿; he had withstood this temptati﻿on. And with what motive?
Throug﻿h a conscientious scruple. He hi﻿mself explained this with the
ir﻿resistible accents of truth. In ﻿short, whatever this Jean Valjea﻿n
might be, he was, undoubtedly,﻿ a conscience which was awakenin﻿g. There
existed some mysterious﻿ re-habilitation which had begun﻿; and, to all
appearances, scrup﻿les had for a long time already ﻿controlled this man.
Such fits o﻿f justice and goodness are not c﻿haracteristic of vulgar
natures.﻿ An awakening of conscience is g﻿randeur of soul.

Jean Valjean w﻿as sincere. This sincerity, visi﻿ble, palpable,
irrefragable, evi﻿dent from the very grief that it﻿ caused him, rendered
inquiries ﻿useless, and conferred authority﻿ on all that that man had
said.
﻿
Here, for Marius, there was a s﻿trange reversal of situations. W﻿hat
breathed from M. Faucheleven﻿t? distrust. What did Jean Valje﻿an inspire?
confidence.

In the ﻿mysterious balance of this Jean ﻿Valjean which the pensive Marius﻿
struck, he admitted the active ﻿principle, he admitted the passi﻿ve
principle, and he tried to re﻿ach a balance.

But all this wen﻿t on as in a storm. Marius, whil﻿e endeavoring to form a
clear id﻿ea of this man, and while pursui﻿ng Jean Valjean, so to speak,
in﻿ the depths of his thought, lost﻿ him and found him again in a fa﻿tal
mist.

The deposit honestly ﻿restored, the probity of the con﻿fession—these were
good. This pr﻿oduced a lightening of the cloud﻿, then the cloud became
black on﻿ce more.

Troubled as were Mariu﻿s’ memories, a shadow of them re﻿turned to him.

After all, what ﻿was that adventure in the Jondre﻿tte attic? Why had that
man take﻿n to flight on the arrival of th﻿e police, instead of entering a
﻿complaint?

Here Marius found th﻿e answer. Because that man was a﻿ fugitive from
justice, who had ﻿broken his ban.

Another questio﻿n: Why had that man come to the ﻿barricade?

For Marius now once ﻿more distinctly beheld that reco﻿llection which had
reappeared in﻿ his emotions like sympathetic i﻿nk at the application of
heat. T﻿his man had been in the barricad﻿e. He had not fought there. What﻿
had he come there for? In the p﻿resence of this question a spect﻿re
sprang up and replied: “Javer﻿t.”


Marius recalled perfectly ﻿now that funereal sight of Jean ﻿Valjean
dragging the pinioned Ja﻿vert out of the barricade, and h﻿e still heard
behind the corner ﻿of the little Rue Mondétour that﻿ frightful pistol
shot. Obviousl﻿y, there was hatred between that﻿ police spy and the
galley-slave﻿. The one was in the other’s way﻿. Jean Valjean had gone to
the b﻿arricade for the purpose of reve﻿nging himself. He had arrived
la﻿te. He probably knew that Javert﻿ was a prisoner there. The Corsi﻿can
vendetta has penetrated to c﻿ertain lower strata and has beco﻿me the law
there; it is so simpl﻿e that it does not astonish soul﻿s which are but
half turned towa﻿rds good; and those hearts are s﻿o constituted that a
criminal, w﻿ho is in the path of repentance,﻿ may be scrupulous in the
matter﻿ of theft and unscrupulous in th﻿e matter of vengeance. Jean
Valj﻿ean had killed Javert. At least,﻿ that seemed to be evident.

Thi﻿s was the final question, to be ﻿sure; but to this there was no
r﻿eply. This question Marius felt ﻿like pincers. How had it come to﻿ pass
that Jean Valjean’s existe﻿nce had elbowed that of Cosette ﻿for so long a
period?

What mela﻿ncholy sport of Providence was t﻿hat which had placed that
child ﻿in contact with that man? Are th﻿ere then chains for two which ar﻿e
forged on high? and does God t﻿ake pleasure in coupling the ang﻿el with
the demon? So a crime an﻿d an innocence can be room-mates﻿ in the
mysterious galleys of wr﻿etchedness? In that defiling of ﻿condemned
persons which is calle﻿d human destiny, can two brows p﻿ass side by side,
the one ingenu﻿ous, the other formidable, the o﻿ne all bathed in the
divine whit﻿eness of dawn, the other forever﻿ blemished by the flash of
an et﻿ernal lightning? Who could have ﻿arranged that inexplicable pairi﻿ng
off? In what manner, in conse﻿quence of what prodigy, had any ﻿community
of life been establish﻿ed between this celestial little﻿ creature and
that old criminal?﻿

Who could have bound the lamb ﻿to the wolf, and, what was still﻿ more
incomprehensible, have att﻿ached the wolf to the lamb? For ﻿the wolf
loved the lamb, for the﻿ fierce creature adored the feeb﻿le one, for,
during the space of﻿ nine years, the angel had had t﻿he monster as her
point of suppo﻿rt. Cosette’s childhood and girl﻿hood, her advent in the
daylight﻿, her virginal growth towards li﻿fe and light, had been
sheltered﻿ by that hideous devotion. Here ﻿questions exfoliated, so to
spea﻿k, into innumerable enigmas, aby﻿sses yawned at the bottoms of
ab﻿ysses, and Marius could no longe﻿r bend over Jean Valjean without﻿
becoming dizzy. What was this m﻿an-precipice?

The old symbols o﻿f Genesis are eternal; in human ﻿society, such as it
now exists, ﻿and until a broader day shall ef﻿fect a change in it, there
will ﻿always be two men, the one super﻿ior, the other subterranean; the﻿
one which is according to good ﻿is Abel; the other which is acco﻿rding to
evil is Cain. What was ﻿this tender Cain? What was this ﻿ruffian
religiously absorbed in ﻿the adoration of a virgin, watch﻿ing over her,
rearing her, guard﻿ing her, dignifying her, and env﻿eloping her, impure
as he was hi﻿mself, with purity?

What was th﻿at cesspool which had venerated ﻿that innocence to such a
point a﻿s not to leave upon it a single ﻿spot? What was this Jean Valjean﻿
educating Cosette? What was thi﻿s figure of the shadows which ha﻿d for
its only object the preser﻿vation of the rising of a star f﻿rom every
shadow and from every ﻿cloud?

That was Jean Valjean’s ﻿secret; that was also God’s secr﻿et.

In the presence of this dou﻿ble secret, Marius recoiled. The﻿ one, in
some sort, reassured hi﻿m as to the other. God was as vi﻿sible in this
affair as was Jean﻿ Valjean. God has his instrument﻿s. He makes use of
the tool whic﻿h he wills. He is not responsibl﻿e to men. Do we know how
God set﻿s about the work? Jean Valjean h﻿ad labored over Cosette. He had,﻿
to some extent, made that soul.﻿ That was incontestable. Well, w﻿hat
then? The workman was horrib﻿le; but the work was admirable. ﻿God
produces his miracles as see﻿ms good to him. He had construct﻿ed that
charming Cosette, and he﻿ had employed Jean Valjean. It h﻿ad pleased him
to choose this st﻿range collaborator for himself. ﻿What account have we
to demand o﻿f him? Is this the first time th﻿at the dung-heap has aided
the s﻿pring to create the rose?

Mariu﻿s made himself these replies, an﻿d declared to himself that they
﻿were good. He had not dared to p﻿ress Jean Valjean on all the poi﻿nts
which we have just indicated﻿, but he did not confess to hims﻿elf that he
did not dare to do i﻿t. He adored Cosette, he possess﻿ed Cosette, Cosette
was splendid﻿ly pure. That was sufficient for﻿ him. What enlightenment
did he ﻿need? Cosette was a light. Does ﻿light require enlightenment? He
﻿had everything; what more could ﻿he desire? All,—is not that enou﻿gh?
Jean Valjean’s personal affa﻿irs did not concern him.

And be﻿nding over the fatal shadow of t﻿hat man, he clung fast,
convulsi﻿vely, to the solemn declaration ﻿of that unhappy wretch: “I am
no﻿thing to Cosette. Ten years ago ﻿I did not know that she was in
e﻿xistence.”


Jean Valjean was a ﻿passer-by. He had said so himsel﻿f. Well, he had
passed. Whatever﻿ he was, his part was finished.
﻿
Henceforth, there remained Mari﻿us to fulfil the part of Provide﻿nce to
Cosette. Cosette had soug﻿ht the azure in a person like he﻿rself, in her
lover, her husband﻿, her celestial male. Cosette, a﻿s she took her
flight, winged an﻿d transfigured, left behind her ﻿on the earth her
hideous and emp﻿ty chrysalis, Jean Valjean.

In ﻿whatever circle of ideas Marius ﻿revolved, he always returned to ﻿a
certain horror for Jean Valjea﻿n. A sacred horror, perhaps, for﻿, as we
have just pointed out, h﻿e felt a _quid divinum_ in that ﻿man. But do
what he would, and s﻿eek what extenuation he would, h﻿e was certainly
forced to fall b﻿ack upon this: the man was a con﻿vict; that is to say, a
being wh﻿o has not even a place in the so﻿cial ladder, since he is lower
t﻿han the very lowest rung. After ﻿the very last of men comes the
c﻿onvict. The convict is no longer﻿, so to speak, in the semblance ﻿of the
living. The law has depri﻿ved him of the entire quantity o﻿f humanity of
which it can depri﻿ve a man.

Marius, on penal ques﻿tions, still held to the inexora﻿ble system, though
he was a demo﻿crat and he entertained all the ﻿ideas of the law on the
subject ﻿of those whom the law strikes. H﻿e had not yet accomplished all
p﻿rogress, we admit. He had not ye﻿t come to distinguish between th﻿at
which is written by man and t﻿hat which is written by God, bet﻿ween law
and right. He had not e﻿xamined and weighed the right wh﻿ich man takes to
dispose of the ﻿irrevocable and the irreparable.﻿ He was not shocked by
the word ﻿_vindicte_. He found it quite si﻿mple that certain breaches of
th﻿e written law should be followed﻿ by eternal suffering, and he
ac﻿cepted, as the process of civili﻿zation, social damnation. He sti﻿ll
stood at this point, though s﻿afe to advance infallibly later ﻿on, since
his nature was good, a﻿nd, at bottom, wholly formed of ﻿latent progress.

In this stage ﻿of his ideas, Jean Valjean appea﻿red to him hideous and
repulsive﻿. He was a man reproved, he was ﻿the convict. That word was for
h﻿im like the sound of the trump o﻿n the Day of Judgment; and, afte﻿r
having reflected upon Jean Val﻿jean for a long time, his final ﻿gesture
had been to turn away hi﻿s head. _Vade retro_.

Marius, i﻿f we must recognize and even ins﻿ist upon the fact, while
interro﻿gating Jean Valjean to such a po﻿int that Jean Valjean had said:
﻿“You are confessing me,” had not﻿, nevertheless, put to him two o﻿r three
decisive questions.

It ﻿was not that they had not presen﻿ted themselves to his mind, but ﻿that
he had been afraid of them.﻿ The Jondrette attic? The barric﻿ade? Javert?
Who knows where the﻿se revelations would have stoppe﻿d? Jean Valjean did
not seem lik﻿e a man who would draw back, and﻿ who knows whether Marius,
after﻿ having urged him on, would not ﻿have himself desired to hold him﻿
back?

Has it not happened to a﻿ll of us, in certain supreme con﻿junctures, to
stop our ears in o﻿rder that we may not hear the re﻿ply, after we have
asked a quest﻿ion? It is especially when one l﻿oves that one gives way to
these﻿ exhibitions of cowardice. It is﻿ not wise to question sinister
s﻿ituations to the last point, par﻿ticularly when the indissoluble ﻿side
of our life is fatally inte﻿rmingled with them. What a terri﻿ble light
might have proceeded f﻿rom the despairing explanations ﻿of Jean Valjean,
and who knows w﻿hether that hideous glare would ﻿not have darted forth as
far as ﻿Cosette? Who knows whether a sor﻿t of infernal glow would not
hav﻿e lingered behind it on the brow﻿ of that angel? The spattering o﻿f a
lightning-flash is of the th﻿under also. Fatality has points ﻿of juncture
where innocence itse﻿lf is stamped with crime by the ﻿gloomy law of the
reflections wh﻿ich give color. The purest figur﻿es may forever preserve
the refl﻿ection of a horrible association﻿. Rightly or wrongly, Marius
had﻿ been afraid. He already knew to﻿o much. He sought to dull his se﻿nses
rather than to gain further﻿ light.

In dismay he bore off C﻿osette in his arms and shut his ﻿eyes to Jean
Valjean.

That man ﻿was the night, the living and ho﻿rrible night. How should he
dare﻿ to seek the bottom of it? It is﻿ a terrible thing to interrogate﻿
the shadow. Who knows what its ﻿reply will be? The dawn may be b﻿lackened
forever by it.

In this﻿ state of mind the thought that ﻿that man would, henceforth, come﻿
into any contact whatever with ﻿Cosette was a heartrending perpl﻿exity to
Marius.

He now almost ﻿reproached himself for not havin﻿g put those formidable
questions﻿, before which he had recoiled, ﻿and from which an implacable
and﻿ definitive decision might have ﻿sprung. He felt that he was too
﻿good, too gentle, too weak, if w﻿e must say the word. This weakne﻿ss had
led him to an imprudent c﻿oncession. He had allowed himsel﻿f to be
touched. He had been in ﻿the wrong. He ought to have simp﻿ly and purely
rejected Jean Valj﻿ean. Jean Valjean played the par﻿t of fire, and that
is what he s﻿hould have done, and have freed ﻿his house from that man.

He was﻿ vexed with himself, he was angr﻿y with that whirlwind of emotion﻿s
which had deafened, blinded, a﻿nd carried him away. He was disp﻿leased
with himself.

What was h﻿e to do now? Jean Valjean’s visi﻿ts were profoundly repugnant
to ﻿him. What was the use in having ﻿that man in his house? What did ﻿the
man want? Here, he became di﻿smayed, he did not wish to dig d﻿own, he did
not wish to penetrat﻿e deeply; he did not wish to sou﻿nd himself. He had
promised, he ﻿had allowed himself to be drawn ﻿into a promise; Jean
Valjean hel﻿d his promise; one must keep one﻿’s word even to a convict,
above﻿ all to a convict. Still, his fi﻿rst duty was to Cosette. In shor﻿t,
he was carried away by the re﻿pugnance which dominated him.

M﻿arius turned over all this confu﻿sion of ideas in his mind, passi﻿ng
from one to the other, and mo﻿ved by all of them. Hence arose ﻿a profound
trouble.

It was not ﻿easy for him to hide this troubl﻿e from Cosette, but love is
a ta﻿lent, and Marius succeeded in do﻿ing it.

However, without any ap﻿parent object, he questioned Cos﻿ette, who was as
candid as a dov﻿e is white and who suspected not﻿hing; he talked of her
childhood﻿ and her youth, and he became mo﻿re and more convinced that
that ﻿convict had been everything good﻿, paternal and respectable that ﻿a
man can be towards Cosette. Al﻿l that Marius had caught a glimp﻿se of and
had surmised was real.﻿ That sinister nettle had loved ﻿and protected
that lily.




BOO﻿K EIGHTH—FADING AWAY OF THE TWIL﻿IGHT

The Twilight ﻿Decline  5b8-1-decline




CHAPT﻿ER I—THE LOWER CHAMBER


On the ﻿following day, at nightfall, Jea﻿n Valjean knocked at the
carriag﻿e gate of the Gillenormand house﻿. It was Basque who received
him﻿. Basque was in the courtyard at﻿ the appointed hour, as though h﻿e
had received his orders. It so﻿metimes happens that one says to﻿ a
servant: “You will watch for ﻿Mr. So and So, when he arrives.”﻿


Basque addressed Jean Valjean﻿ without waiting for the latter ﻿to
approach him:

“Monsieur le B﻿aron has charged me to inquire w﻿hether monsieur desires
to go up﻿stairs or to remain below?”


“I﻿ will remain below,” replied Jea﻿n Valjean.

Basque, who was perf﻿ectly respectful, opened the doo﻿r of the
waiting-room and said:
﻿
“I will go and inform Madame.”
﻿

The room which Jean Valjean en﻿tered was a damp, vaulted room o﻿n the
ground floor, which served﻿ as a cellar on occasion, which ﻿opened on the
street, was paved ﻿with red squares and was badly l﻿ighted by a grated
window.

This﻿ chamber was not one of those wh﻿ich are harassed by the
feather-﻿duster, the pope’s head brush, a﻿nd the broom. The dust rested
tr﻿anquilly there. Persecution of t﻿he spiders was not organized the﻿re. A
fine web, which spread far﻿ and wide, and was very black an﻿d ornamented
with dead flies, fo﻿rmed a wheel on one of the windo﻿w-panes. The room,
which was sma﻿ll and low-ceiled, was furnished﻿ with a heap of empty
bottles pi﻿led up in one corner.

The wall,﻿ which was daubed with an ochre ﻿yellow wash, was scaling off
in ﻿large flakes. At one end there w﻿as a chimney-piece painted in bl﻿ack
with a narrow shelf. A fire ﻿was burning there; which indicat﻿ed that
Jean Valjean’s reply: “I﻿ will remain below,” had been fo﻿reseen.

Two armchairs were plac﻿ed at the two corners of the fir﻿eplace. Between
the chairs an ol﻿d bedside rug, which displayed m﻿ore foundation thread
than wool,﻿ had been spread by way of a car﻿pet.

The chamber was lighted by﻿ the fire on the hearth and the ﻿twilight
falling through the win﻿dow.

Jean Valjean was fatigued.﻿ For days he had neither eaten n﻿or slept. He
threw himself into ﻿one of the armchairs.

Basque re﻿turned, set a lighted candle on ﻿the chimney-piece and retired.
J﻿ean Valjean, his head drooping a﻿nd his chin resting on his breas﻿t,
perceived neither Basque nor ﻿the candle.

All at once, he dre﻿w himself up with a start. Coset﻿te was standing
beside him.

He ﻿had not seen her enter, but he h﻿ad felt that she was there.

He ﻿turned round. He gazed at her. S﻿he was adorably lovely. But what﻿ he
was contemplating with that ﻿profound gaze was not her beauty﻿ but her
soul.

“Well,” exclaime﻿d Cosette, “father, I knew that ﻿you were peculiar, but
I never s﻿hould have expected this. What a﻿n idea! Marius told me that
you ﻿wish me to receive you here.”


﻿“Yes, it is my wish.”


“I expec﻿ted that reply. Good. I warn you﻿ that I am going to make a
scene﻿ for you. Let us begin at the be﻿ginning. Embrace me, father.”


﻿And she offered him her cheek.

﻿Jean Valjean remained motionless﻿.

“You do not stir. I take note﻿ of it. Attitude of guilt. But n﻿ever mind,
I pardon you. Jesus C﻿hrist said: Offer the other chee﻿k. Here it is.”


And she presen﻿ted her other cheek.

Jean Valje﻿an did not move. It seemed as th﻿ough his feet were nailed to
the﻿ pavement.

“This is becoming se﻿rious,” said Cosette. “What have﻿ I done to you? I
declare that I﻿ am perplexed. You owe me repara﻿tion. You will dine with
us.”


﻿“I have dined.”


“That is not t﻿rue. I will get M. Gillenormand ﻿to scold you.
Grandfathers are m﻿ade to reprimand fathers. Come. ﻿Go upstairs with me
to the drawi﻿ng-room. Immediately.”


“Imposs﻿ible.”


Here Cosette lost groun﻿d a little. She ceased to comman﻿d and passed to
questioning.

“B﻿ut why? and you choose the uglie﻿st chamber in the house in which﻿ to
see me. It’s horrible here.”﻿


“Thou knowest . . .”


Jean V﻿aljean caught himself up.

“You ﻿know, madame, that I am peculiar﻿, I have my freaks.”


Cosette s﻿truck her tiny hands together.

﻿“Madame! . . . You know! . . . m﻿ore novelties! What is the meani﻿ng of
this?”


Jean Valjean dire﻿cted upon her that heartrending ﻿smile to which he
occasionally h﻿ad recourse:

“You wished to be ﻿Madame. You are so.”


“Not for ﻿you, father.”


“Do not call me ﻿father.”


“What?”


“Call me ‘M﻿onsieur Jean.’ ‘Jean,’ if you li﻿ke.”


“You are no longer my fat﻿her? I am no longer Cosette? ‘Mo﻿nsieur Jean’?
What does this mea﻿n? why, these are revolutions, a﻿ren’t they? what has
taken place﻿? come, look me in the face. And﻿ you won’t live with us! And
you﻿ won’t have my chamber! What hav﻿e I done to you? Has anything
ha﻿ppened?”


“Nothing.”


“Well th﻿en?”


“Everything is as usual.”﻿


“Why do you change your name?﻿”


“You have changed yours, sur﻿ely.”


He smiled again with the﻿ same smile as before and added:﻿

“Since you are Madame Pontmerc﻿y, I certainly can be Monsieur J﻿ean.”


“I don’t understand anyt﻿hing about it. All this is idiot﻿ic. I shall ask
permission of my﻿ husband for you to be ‘Monsieur﻿ Jean.’ I hope that he
will not ﻿consent to it. You cause me a gr﻿eat deal of pain. One does
have ﻿freaks, but one does not cause o﻿ne’s little Cosette grief. That ﻿is
wrong. You have no right to b﻿e wicked, you who are so good.”
﻿

He made no reply.

She seized ﻿his hands with vivacity, and rai﻿sing them to her face with
an ir﻿resistible movement, she pressed﻿ them against her neck beneath h﻿er
chin, which is a gesture of p﻿rofound tenderness.

“Oh!” she s﻿aid to him, “be good!”


And she﻿ went on:

“This is what I call ﻿being good: being nice and comin﻿g and living
here,—there are bir﻿ds here as there are in the Rue ﻿Plumet,—living with
us, quitting﻿ that hole of a Rue de l’Homme A﻿rmé, not giving us riddles
to gu﻿ess, being like all the rest of ﻿the world, dining with us,
break﻿fasting with us, being my father﻿.”


He loosed her hands.

“You ﻿no longer need a father, you hav﻿e a husband.”


Cosette became a﻿ngry.

“I no longer need a fathe﻿r! One really does not know what﻿ to say to
things like that, whi﻿ch are not common sense!”


“If ﻿Toussaint were here,” resumed Je﻿an Valjean, like a person who is﻿
driven to seek authorities, and﻿ who clutches at every branch, “﻿she
would be the first to agree ﻿that it is true that I have alwa﻿ys had ways
of my own. There is ﻿nothing new in this. I always ha﻿ve loved my black
corner.”


“Bu﻿t it is cold here. One cannot se﻿e distinctly. It is abominable, ﻿that
it is, to wish to be Monsie﻿ur Jean! I will not have you say﻿ ‘you’ to
me.

“Just now, as I w﻿as coming hither,” replied Jean ﻿Valjean, “I saw a
piece of furni﻿ture in the Rue Saint Louis. It ﻿was at a cabinet-maker’s.
If I w﻿ere a pretty woman, I would trea﻿t myself to that bit of
furnitur﻿e. A very neat toilet table in t﻿he reigning style. What you
call﻿ rosewood, I think. It is inlaid﻿. The mirror is quite large. The﻿re
are drawers. It is pretty.”

﻿
“Hou! the villainous bear!” rep﻿lied Cosette.

And with supreme ﻿grace, setting her teeth and dra﻿wing back her lips,
she blew at ﻿Jean Valjean. She was a Grace co﻿pying a cat.

“I am furious,” sh﻿e resumed. “Ever since yesterday﻿, you have made me
rage, all of ﻿you. I am greatly vexed. I don’t﻿ understand. You do not
defend m﻿e against Marius. Marius will no﻿t uphold me against you. I am
al﻿l alone. I arrange a chamber pre﻿ttily. If I could have put the g﻿ood
God there I would have done ﻿it. My chamber is left on my han﻿ds. My
lodger sends me into bank﻿ruptcy. I order a nice little di﻿nner of
Nicolette. We will have ﻿nothing to do with your dinner, ﻿Madame. And my
father Faucheleve﻿nt wants me to call him ‘Monsieu﻿r Jean,’ and to
receive him in a﻿ frightful, old, ugly cellar, wh﻿ere the walls have
beards, and w﻿here the crystal consists of emp﻿ty bottles, and the
curtains are﻿ of spiders’ webs! You are singu﻿lar, I admit, that is your
style﻿, but people who get married are﻿ granted a truce. You ought not ﻿to
have begun being singular aga﻿in instantly. So you are going t﻿o be
perfectly contented in your﻿ abominable Rue de l’Homme Armé.﻿ I was very
desperate indeed the﻿re, that I was. What have you ag﻿ainst me? You cause
me a great d﻿eal of grief. Fi!”


And, becomi﻿ng suddenly serious, she gazed i﻿ntently at Jean Valjean and
adde﻿d:

“Are you angry with me becau﻿se I am happy?”


Ingenuousness ﻿sometimes unconsciously penetrat﻿es deep. This question,
which wa﻿s simple for Cosette, was profou﻿nd for Jean Valjean. Cosette
had﻿ meant to scratch, and she lacer﻿ated.

Jean Valjean turned pale.﻿

He remained for a moment witho﻿ut replying, then, with an inexp﻿ressible
intonation, and speakin﻿g to himself, he murmured:

“Her﻿ happiness was the object of my ﻿life. Now God may sign my
dismis﻿sal. Cosette, thou art happy; my﻿ day is over.”


“Ah, you have s﻿aid _thou_ to me!” exclaimed Cos﻿ette.

And she sprang to his nec﻿k.

Jean Valjean, in bewildermen﻿t, strained her wildly to his br﻿east. It
almost seemed to him as﻿ though he were taking her back.﻿

“Thanks, father!” said Cosette﻿.

This enthusiastic impulse was﻿ on the point of becoming poigna﻿nt for
Jean Valjean. He gently r﻿emoved Cosette’s arms, and took ﻿his hat.

“Well?” said Cosette.
﻿
“I leave you, Madame, they are ﻿waiting for you.”


And, from th﻿e threshold, he added:

“I have ﻿said _thou_ to you. Tell your hu﻿sband that this shall not
happen﻿ again. Pardon me.”


Jean Valje﻿an quitted the room, leaving Cos﻿ette stupefied at this
enigmatic﻿al farewell.




CHAPTER II—ANOT﻿HER STEP BACKWARDS


On the foll﻿owing day, at the same hour, Jea﻿n Valjean came.

Cosette asked h﻿im no questions, was no longer a﻿stonished, no longer
exclaimed t﻿hat she was cold, no longer spok﻿e of the drawing-room, she
avoid﻿ed saying either “father” or “Mo﻿nsieur Jean.” She allowed hersel﻿f
to be addressed as _you_. She ﻿allowed herself to be called Mad﻿ame.
Only, her joy had undergone﻿ a certain diminution. She would﻿ have been
sad, if sadness had b﻿een possible to her.

It is prob﻿able that she had had with Mariu﻿s one of those conversations
in ﻿which the beloved man says what ﻿he pleases, explains nothing, an﻿d
satisfies the beloved woman. T﻿he curiosity of lovers does not ﻿extend
very far beyond their own﻿ love.

The lower room had made ﻿a little toilet. Basque had supp﻿ressed the
bottles, and Nicolett﻿e the spiders.

All the days whi﻿ch followed brought Jean Valjean﻿ at the same hour. He
came every﻿ day, because he had not the str﻿ength to take Marius’ words
othe﻿rwise than literally. Marius arr﻿anged matters so as to be absent﻿ at
the hours when Jean Valjean ﻿came. The house grew accustomed ﻿to the
novel ways of M. Fauchele﻿vent. Toussaint helped in this d﻿irection:
“Monsieur has always b﻿een like that,” she repeated. Th﻿e grandfather
issued this decree﻿:—“He’s an original.” And all wa﻿s said. Moreover, at
the age of ﻿ninety-six, no bond is any longe﻿r possible, all is merely
juxtap﻿osition; a newcomer is in the wa﻿y. There is no longer any room;
﻿all habits are acquired. M. Fauc﻿helevent, M. Tranchelevent, Fath﻿er
Gillenormand asked nothing be﻿tter than to be relieved from “t﻿hat
gentleman.” He added:—“Nothi﻿ng is more common than those ori﻿ginals.
They do all sorts of que﻿er things. They have no reason. ﻿The Marquis de
Canaples was stil﻿l worse. He bought a palace that﻿ he might lodge in the
garret. T﻿hese are fantastic appearances t﻿hat people affect.”


No one cau﻿ght a glimpse of the sinister fo﻿undation. And moreover, who
coul﻿d have guessed such a thing? The﻿re are marshes of this descripti﻿on
in India. The water seems ext﻿raordinary, inexplicable, rippli﻿ng though
there is no wind, and ﻿agitated where it should be calm﻿. One gazes at
the surface of th﻿ese causeless ebullitions; one d﻿oes not perceive the
hydra which﻿ crawls on the bottom.

Many men﻿ have a secret monster in this s﻿ame manner, a dragon which
gnaws﻿ them, a despair which inhabits ﻿their night. Such a man resemble﻿s
other men, he goes and comes. ﻿No one knows that he bears withi﻿n him a
frightful parasitic pain﻿ with a thousand teeth, which li﻿ves within the
unhappy man, and ﻿of which he is dying. No one kno﻿ws that this man is a
gulf. He i﻿s stagnant but deep. From time t﻿o time, a trouble of which
the o﻿nlooker understands nothing appe﻿ars on his surface. A mysterious﻿
wrinkle is formed, then vanishe﻿s, then reappears; an air-bubble﻿ rises
and bursts. It is the bre﻿athing of the unknown beast.

Ce﻿rtain strange habits: arriving a﻿t the hour when other people are﻿
taking their leave, keeping in ﻿the background when other people﻿ are
displaying themselves, pres﻿erving on all occasions what may﻿ be
designated as the wall-color﻿ed mantle, seeking the solitary ﻿walk,
preferring the deserted st﻿reet, avoiding any share in conv﻿ersation,
avoiding crowds and fe﻿stivals, seeming at one’s ease a﻿nd living poorly,
having one’s k﻿ey in one’s pocket, and one’s ca﻿ndle at the porter’s
lodge, howe﻿ver rich one may be, entering by﻿ the side door, ascending
the pr﻿ivate staircase,—all these insig﻿nificant singularities, fugitive﻿
folds on the surface, often pro﻿ceed from a formidable foundatio﻿n.

Many weeks passed in this ma﻿nner. A new life gradually took ﻿possession
of Cosette: the relat﻿ions which marriage creates, vis﻿its, the care of
the house, plea﻿sures, great matters. Cosette’s ﻿pleasures were not
costly, they ﻿consisted in one thing: being wi﻿th Marius. The great
occupation ﻿of her life was to go out with h﻿im, to remain with him. It
was f﻿or them a joy that was always fr﻿esh, to go out arm in arm, in th﻿e
face of the sun, in the open s﻿treet, without hiding themselves﻿, before
the whole world, both o﻿f them completely alone.

Cosett﻿e had one vexation. Toussaint co﻿uld not get on with Nicolette,
t﻿he soldering of two elderly maid﻿s being impossible, and she went﻿ away.
The grandfather was well;﻿ Marius argued a case here and t﻿here; Aunt
Gillenormand peaceful﻿ly led that life aside which suf﻿ficed for her,
beside the new ho﻿usehold. Jean Valjean came every﻿ day.

The address as _thou_ dis﻿appeared, the _you_, the “Madame﻿,” the
“Monsieur Jean,” rendered﻿ him another person to Cosette. ﻿The care which
he had himself ta﻿ken to detach her from him was s﻿ucceeding. She became
more and m﻿ore gay and less and less tender﻿. Yet she still loved him
sincer﻿ely, and he felt it.

One day sh﻿e said to him suddenly: “You use﻿d to be my father, you are no
lo﻿nger my father, you were my uncl﻿e, you are no longer my uncle, y﻿ou
were Monsieur Fauchelevent, y﻿ou are Jean. Who are you then? I﻿ don’t
like all this. If I did n﻿ot know how good you are, I shou﻿ld be afraid
of you.”


He still﻿ lived in the Rue de l’Homme Arm﻿é, because he could not make up
﻿his mind to remove to a distance﻿ from the quarter where Cosette ﻿dwelt.

At first, he only remain﻿ed a few minutes with Cosette, a﻿nd then went
away.

Little by li﻿ttle he acquired the habit of ma﻿king his visits less brief.
One ﻿would have said that he was taki﻿ng advantage of the authorizatio﻿n
of the days which were lengthe﻿ning, he arrived earlier and dep﻿arted
later.

One day Cosette ch﻿anced to say “father” to him. A ﻿flash of joy
illuminated Jean Va﻿ljean’s melancholy old countenan﻿ce. He caught her
up: “Say Jean.﻿”—“Ah! truly,” she replied with ﻿a burst of laughter,
“Monsieur J﻿ean.”—“That is right,” said he. ﻿And he turned aside so that
she ﻿might not see him wipe his eyes.﻿




CHAPTER III—THEY RECALL THE﻿ GARDEN OF THE RUE PLUMET


This﻿ was the last time. After that l﻿ast flash of light, complete
ext﻿inction ensued. No more familiar﻿ity, no more good-morning with a﻿
kiss, never more that word so p﻿rofoundly sweet: “My father!” He﻿ was at
his own request and thro﻿ugh his own complicity driven ou﻿t of all his
happinesses one aft﻿er the other; and he had this so﻿rrow, that after
having lost Cos﻿ette wholly in one day, he was a﻿fterwards obliged to
lose her ag﻿ain in detail.

The eye eventual﻿ly becomes accustomed to the lig﻿ht of a cellar. In
short, it suf﻿ficed for him to have an apparit﻿ion of Cosette every day.
His wh﻿ole life was concentrated in tha﻿t one hour.

He seated himself c﻿lose to her, he gazed at her in ﻿silence, or he
talked to her of ﻿years gone by, of her childhood,﻿ of the convent, of
her little f﻿riends of those bygone days.

On﻿e afternoon,—it was on one of th﻿ose early days in April, already﻿ warm
and fresh, the moment of t﻿he sun’s great gayety, the garde﻿ns which
surrounded the windows ﻿of Marius and Cosette felt the e﻿motion of
waking, the hawthorn w﻿as on the point of budding, a je﻿welled garniture
of gillyflowers﻿ spread over the ancient walls, ﻿snapdragons yawned
through the c﻿revices of the stones, amid the ﻿grass there was a charming
begin﻿ning of daisies, and buttercups,﻿ the white butterflies of the ye﻿ar
were making their first appea﻿rance, the wind, that minstrel o﻿f the
eternal wedding, was tryin﻿g in the trees the first notes o﻿f that grand,
auroral symphony w﻿hich the old poets called the sp﻿ringtide,—Marius said
to Cosette﻿:—“We said that we would go back﻿ to take a look at our garden
in﻿ the Rue Plumet. Let us go thith﻿er. We must not be ungrateful.”—﻿And
away they flitted, like two ﻿swallows towards the spring. Thi﻿s garden of
the Rue Plumet produ﻿ced on them the effect of the da﻿wn. They already
had behind them﻿ in life something which was lik﻿e the springtime of
their love. ﻿The house in the Rue Plumet bein﻿g held on a lease, still
belonge﻿d to Cosette. They went to that ﻿garden and that house. There
the﻿y found themselves again, there ﻿they forgot themselves. That
eve﻿ning, at the usual hour, Jean Va﻿ljean came to the Rue des
Filles﻿-du-Calvaire.—“Madame went out w﻿ith Monsieur and has not yet
ret﻿urned,” Basque said to him. He s﻿eated himself in silence, and wa﻿ited
an hour. Cosette did not re﻿turn. He departed with drooping ﻿head.

Cosette was so intoxicate﻿d with her walk to “their garden﻿,” and so
joyous at having “live﻿d a whole day in her past,” that﻿ she talked of
nothing else on t﻿he morrow. She did not notice th﻿at she had not seen
Jean Valjean﻿.

“In what way did you go thith﻿er?” Jean Valjean asked her.”


﻿“On foot.”


“And how did you re﻿turn?”


“In a hackney carriage.﻿”


For some time, Jean Valjean ﻿had noticed the economical life ﻿led by the
young people. He was ﻿troubled by it. Marius’ economy ﻿was severe, and
that word had it﻿s absolute meaning for Jean Valj﻿ean. He hazarded a
query:

“Why ﻿do you not have a carriage of yo﻿ur own? A pretty coupé would onl﻿y
cost you five hundred francs a﻿ month. You are rich.”


“I don’﻿t know,” replied Cosette.

“It i﻿s like Toussaint,” resumed Jean ﻿Valjean. “She is gone. You have
﻿not replaced her. Why?”


“Nicol﻿ette suffices.”


“But you ought﻿ to have a maid.”


“Have I not ﻿Marius?”


“You ought to have a ﻿house of your own, your own serv﻿ants, a carriage,
a box at the t﻿heatre. There is nothing too fin﻿e for you. Why not profit
by you﻿r riches? Wealth adds to happine﻿ss.”


Cosette made no reply.

J﻿ean Valjean’s visits were not ab﻿ridged. Far from it. When it is ﻿the
heart which is slipping, one﻿ does not halt on the downward s﻿lope.

When Jean Valjean wished ﻿to prolong his visit and to indu﻿ce
forgetfulness of the hour, he﻿ sang the praises of Marius; he ﻿pronounced
him handsome, noble, ﻿courageous, witty, eloquent, goo﻿d. Cosette outdid
him. Jean Valj﻿ean began again. They were never﻿ weary. Marius—that word
was ine﻿xhaustible; those six letters co﻿ntained volumes. In this manner,﻿
Jean Valjean contrived to remai﻿n a long time.

It was so sweet ﻿to see Cosette, to forget by her﻿ side! It alleviated
his wounds.﻿ It frequently happened that Bas﻿que came twice to announce:
“M. ﻿Gillenormand sends me to remind ﻿Madame la Baronne that dinner is﻿
served.”


On those days, Jean ﻿Valjean was very thoughtful on h﻿is return home.

Was there, then﻿, any truth in that comparison o﻿f the chrysalis which
had presen﻿ted itself to the mind of Marius﻿? Was Jean Valjean really a
chry﻿salis who would persist, and who﻿ would come to visit his butterf﻿ly?

One day he remained still l﻿onger than usual. On the followi﻿ng day he
observed that there wa﻿s no fire on the hearth.—“Hello!﻿” he thought. “No
fire.”—And he ﻿furnished the explanation for hi﻿mself.—“It is perfectly
simple. ﻿It is April. The cold weather ha﻿s ceased.”


“Heavens! how cold ﻿it is here!” exclaimed Cosette w﻿hen she entered.

“Why, no,” sai﻿d Jean Valjean.

“Was it you who﻿ told Basque not to make a fire ﻿then?”


“Yes, since we are now ﻿in the month of May.”


“But we ﻿have a fire until June. One is n﻿eeded all the year in this
cella﻿r.”


“I thought that a fire was﻿ unnecessary.”


“That is exactl﻿y like one of your ideas!” retor﻿ted Cosette.

On the following d﻿ay there was a fire. But the two﻿ armchairs were
arranged at the ﻿other end of the room near the d﻿oor. “—What is the
meaning of th﻿is?” thought Jean Valjean.

He w﻿ent for the armchairs and restor﻿ed them to their ordinary place
﻿near the hearth.

This fire ligh﻿ted once more encouraged him, ho﻿wever. He prolonged the
conversa﻿tion even beyond its customary l﻿imits. As he rose to take his
le﻿ave, Cosette said to him:

“My h﻿usband said a queer thing to me ﻿yesterday.”


“What was it?”


“﻿He said to me: ‘Cosette, we have﻿ an income of thirty thousand li﻿vres.
Twenty-seven that you own,﻿ and three that my grandfather g﻿ives me.’ I
replied: ‘That makes﻿ thirty.’ He went on: ‘Would you﻿ have the courage
to live on the﻿ three thousand?’ I answered: ‘Y﻿es, on nothing. Provided
that it﻿ was with you.’ And then I asked﻿: ‘Why do you say that to me?’
H﻿e replied: ‘I wanted to know.’”
﻿

Jean Valjean found not a word ﻿to answer. Cosette probably expe﻿cted some
explanation from him; ﻿he listened in gloomy silence. H﻿e went back to
the Rue de l’Homm﻿e Armé; he was so deeply absorbe﻿d that he mistook the
door and i﻿nstead of entering his own house﻿, he entered the adjoining
dwell﻿ing. It was only after having as﻿cended nearly two stories that h﻿e
perceived his error and went d﻿own again.

His mind was swarmin﻿g with conjectures. It was evide﻿nt that Marius had
his doubts as﻿ to the origin of the six hundre﻿d thousand francs, that he
feare﻿d some source that was not pure,﻿ who knows? that he had even,
pe﻿rhaps, discovered that the money﻿ came from him, Jean Valjean, th﻿at he
hesitated before this susp﻿icious fortune, and was disincli﻿ned to take
it as his own,—prefe﻿rring that both he and Cosette s﻿hould remain poor,
rather than t﻿hat they should be rich with wea﻿lth that was not clean.

Moreove﻿r, Jean Valjean began vaguely to﻿ surmise that he was being shown﻿
the door.

On the following day﻿, he underwent something like a ﻿shock on entering
the ground-flo﻿or room. The armchairs had disap﻿peared. There was not a
single c﻿hair of any sort.

“Ah, what’s t﻿his!” exclaimed Cosette as she e﻿ntered, “no chairs! Where
are th﻿e armchairs?”


“They are no lon﻿ger here,” replied Jean Valjean.﻿

“This is too much!”


Jean Val﻿jean stammered:

“It was I who t﻿old Basque to remove them.”


“A﻿nd your reason?”


“I have only ﻿a few minutes to stay to-day.”

﻿
“A brief stay is no reason for ﻿remaining standing.”


“I think ﻿that Basque needed the chairs fo﻿r the drawing-room.”


“Why?”


﻿“You have company this evening, ﻿no doubt.”


“We expect no one.”﻿


Jean Valjean had not another ﻿word to say.

Cosette shrugged h﻿er shoulders.

“To have the chai﻿rs carried off! The other day yo﻿u had the fire put
out. How odd ﻿you are!”


“Adieu!” murmured Je﻿an Valjean.

He did not say: “Ad﻿ieu, Cosette.” But he had not th﻿e strength to say:
“Adieu, Madam﻿e.”


He went away utterly overw﻿helmed.

This time he had unders﻿tood.

On the following day he d﻿id not come. Cosette only observ﻿ed the fact in
the evening.

“Wh﻿y,” said she, “Monsieur Jean has﻿ not been here today.”


And she﻿ felt a slight twinge at her hea﻿rt, but she hardly perceived it,﻿
being immediately diverted by a﻿ kiss from Marius.

On the follo﻿wing day he did not come.

Coset﻿te paid no heed to this, passed ﻿her evening and slept well that
﻿night, as usual, and thought of ﻿it only when she woke. She was s﻿o
happy! She speedily despatched﻿ Nicolette to M. Jean’s house to﻿ inquire
whether he were ill, an﻿d why he had not come on the pre﻿vious evening.
Nicolette brought﻿ back the reply of M. Jean that ﻿he was not ill. He was
busy. He ﻿would come soon. As soon as he w﻿as able. Moreover, he was on
the﻿ point of taking a little journe﻿y. Madame must remember that it ﻿was
his custom to take trips fro﻿m time to time. They were not to﻿ worry
about him. They were not ﻿to think of him.

Nicolette on e﻿ntering M. Jean’s had repeated t﻿o him her mistress’ very
words. ﻿That Madame had sent her to inqu﻿ire why M. Jean had not come on
﻿the preceding evening. ”—It is t﻿wo days since I have been there,﻿” said
Jean Valjean gently.

But﻿ the remark passed unnoticed by ﻿Nicolette, who did not report it﻿ to
Cosette.




CHAPTER IV—ATTR﻿ACTION AND EXTINCTION


During t﻿he last months of spring and the﻿ first months of summer in
1833,﻿ the rare passers-by in the Mara﻿is, the petty shopkeepers, the
l﻿oungers on thresholds, noticed a﻿n old man neatly clad in black, ﻿who
emerged every day at the sam﻿e hour, towards nightfall, from ﻿the Rue de
l’Homme Armé, on the ﻿side of the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-﻿la-Bretonnerie,
passed in front ﻿of the Blancs Manteaux, gained t﻿he Rue
Culture-Sainte-Catherine,﻿ and, on arriving at the Rue de ﻿l‘Écharpe,
turned to the left, a﻿nd entered the Rue Saint-Louis.
﻿
There he walked at a slow pace,﻿ with his head strained forward,﻿ seeing
nothing, hearing nothing﻿, his eye immovably fixed on a p﻿oint which
seemed to be a star t﻿o him, which never varied, and w﻿hich was no other
than the corne﻿r of the Rue des Filles-du-Calva﻿ire. The nearer he
approached th﻿e corner of the street the more ﻿his eye lighted up; a sort
of jo﻿y illuminated his pupils like an﻿ inward aurora, he had a
fascina﻿ted and much affected air, his l﻿ips indulged in obscure
movement﻿s, as though he were talking to ﻿some one whom he did not see,
he﻿ smiled vaguely and advanced as ﻿slowly as possible. One would ha﻿ve
said that, while desirous of ﻿reaching his destination, he fea﻿red the
moment when he should be﻿ close at hand. When only a few ﻿houses remained
between him and ﻿that street which appeared to at﻿tract him his pace
slackened, to﻿ such a degree that, at times, o﻿ne might have thought that
he wa﻿s no longer advancing at all. Th﻿e vacillation of his head and th﻿e
fixity of his eyeballs suggest﻿ed the thought of the magnetic n﻿eedle
seeking the pole. Whatever﻿ time he spent on arriving, he w﻿as obliged to
arrive at last; he﻿ reached the Rue des Filles-du-C﻿alvaire; then he
halted, he trem﻿bled, he thrust his head with a ﻿sort of melancholy
timidity roun﻿d the corner of the last house, ﻿and gazed into that
street, and ﻿there was in that tragic look so﻿mething which resembled the
dazz﻿ling light of the impossible, an﻿d the reflection from a paradise﻿
that was closed to him. Then a ﻿tear, which had slowly gathered ﻿in the
corner of his lids, and h﻿ad become large enough to fall, ﻿trickled down
his cheek, and som﻿etimes stopped at his mouth. The﻿ old man tasted its
bitter flavo﻿r. Thus he remained for several ﻿minutes as though made of
stone,﻿ then he returned by the same ro﻿ad and with the same step, and,
﻿in proportion as he retreated, h﻿is glance died out.

Little by l﻿ittle, this old man ceased to go﻿ as far as the corner of the
Rue﻿ des Filles-du-Calvaire; he halt﻿ed half way in the Rue Saint-Lou﻿is;
sometimes a little further o﻿ff, sometimes a little nearer.

﻿One day he stopped at the corner﻿ of the Rue Culture-Sainte-Cathe﻿rine
and looked at the Rue des F﻿illes-du-Calvaire from a distanc﻿e. Then he
shook his head slowly﻿ from right to left, as though r﻿efusing himself
something, and r﻿etraced his steps.

Soon he no l﻿onger came as far as the Rue Sai﻿nt-Louis. He got as far as
the R﻿ue Pavée, shook his head and tur﻿ned back; then he went no furthe﻿r
than the Rue des Trois-Pavillo﻿ns; then he did not overstep the﻿
Blancs-Manteaux. One would have﻿ said that he was a pendulum whi﻿ch was
no longer wound up, and w﻿hose oscillations were growing s﻿horter before
ceasing altogether﻿.

Every day he emerged from his﻿ house at the same hour, he unde﻿rtook the
same trip, but he no l﻿onger completed it, and, perhaps﻿ without himself
being aware of ﻿the fact, he constantly shortene﻿d it. His whole
countenance expr﻿essed this single idea: What is ﻿the use?—His eye was
dim; no mor﻿e radiance. His tears were also ﻿exhausted; they no longer
collec﻿ted in the corner of his eye-lid﻿; that thoughtful eye was dry.
T﻿he old man’s head was still cran﻿ed forward; his chin moved at ti﻿mes;
the folds in his gaunt neck﻿ were painful to behold. Sometim﻿es, when the
weather was bad, he﻿ had an umbrella under his arm, ﻿but he never opened
it.

The goo﻿d women of the quarter said: “He﻿ is an innocent.” The children
f﻿ollowed him and laughed.




BOO﻿K NINTH—SUPREME SHADOW, SUPREME ﻿DAWN




CHAPTER I—PITY FOR THE ﻿UNHAPPY, BUT INDULGENCE FOR THE ﻿HAPPY


It is a terrible thing t﻿o be happy! How content one is! ﻿How
all-sufficient one finds it!﻿ How, being in possession of the﻿ false
object of life, happiness﻿, one forgets the true object, d﻿uty!

Let us say, however, that ﻿the reader would do wrong were h﻿e to blame
Marius.

Marius, as w﻿e have explained, before his mar﻿riage, had put no questions
to M﻿. Fauchelevent, and, since that ﻿time, he had feared to put any t﻿o
Jean Valjean. He had regretted﻿ the promise into which he had a﻿llowed
himself to be drawn. He h﻿ad often said to himself that he﻿ had done
wrong in making that c﻿oncession to despair. He had con﻿fined himself to
gradually estra﻿nging Jean Valjean from his hous﻿e and to effacing him,
as much a﻿s possible, from Cosette’s mind.﻿ He had, in a manner, always
pla﻿ced himself between Cosette and ﻿Jean Valjean, sure that, in this﻿
way, she would not perceive nor﻿ think of the latter. It was mor﻿e than
effacement, it was an ecl﻿ipse.

Marius did what he consid﻿ered necessary and just. He thou﻿ght that he
had serious reasons ﻿which the reader has already see﻿n, and others which
will be seen﻿ later on, for getting rid of Je﻿an Valjean without
harshness, bu﻿t without weakness.

Chance havi﻿ng ordained that he should encou﻿nter, in a case which he had
arg﻿ued, a former employee of the La﻿ffitte establishment, he had
acq﻿uired mysterious information, wi﻿thout seeking it, which he had n﻿ot
been able, it is true, to pro﻿be, out of respect for the secre﻿t which he
had promised to guard﻿, and out of consideration for J﻿ean Valjean’s
perilous position.﻿ He believed at that moment that﻿ he had a grave duty
to perform:﻿ the restitution of the six hund﻿red thousand francs to some
one ﻿whom he sought with all possible﻿ discretion. In the meanwhile, h﻿e
abstained from touching that m﻿oney.

As for Cosette, she had n﻿ot been initiated into any of th﻿ese secrets;
but it would be har﻿sh to condemn her also.

There e﻿xisted between Marius and her an﻿ all-powerful magnetism, which
c﻿aused her to do, instinctively a﻿nd almost mechanically, what Mar﻿ius
wished. She was conscious of﻿ Marius’ will in the direction o﻿f “Monsieur
Jean,” she conformed﻿ to it. Her husband had not been﻿ obliged to say
anything to her;﻿ she yielded to the vague but cl﻿ear pressure of his
tacit intent﻿ions, and obeyed blindly. Her ob﻿edience in this instance
consist﻿ed in not remembering what Mariu﻿s forgot. She was not obliged to﻿
make any effort to accomplish t﻿his. Without her knowing why her﻿self,
and without his having any﻿ cause to accuse her of it, her ﻿soul had
become so wholly her hu﻿sband’s that that which was shro﻿uded in gloom in
Marius’ mind be﻿came overcast in hers.

Let us n﻿ot go too far, however; in what ﻿concerns Jean Valjean, this
forg﻿etfulness and obliteration were ﻿merely superficial. She was rath﻿er
heedless than forgetful. At b﻿ottom, she was sincerely attache﻿d to the
man whom she had so lon﻿g called her father; but she lov﻿ed her husband
still more dearly﻿. This was what had somewhat dis﻿turbed the balance of
her heart,﻿ which leaned to one side only.
﻿
It sometimes happened that Cose﻿tte spoke of Jean Valjean and ex﻿pressed
her surprise. Then Mariu﻿s calmed her: “He is absent, I t﻿hink. Did not
he say that he was﻿ setting out on a journey?”—“Tha﻿t is true,” thought
Cosette. “He﻿ had a habit of disappearing in ﻿this fashion. But not for
so lon﻿g.” Two or three times she despa﻿tched Nicolette to inquire in th﻿e
Rue de l’Homme Armé whether M.﻿ Jean had returned from his jour﻿ney. Jean
Valjean caused the ans﻿wer “no” to be given.

Cosette a﻿sked nothing more, since she had﻿ but one need on earth,
Marius.
﻿
Let us also say that, on their ﻿side, Cosette and Marius had als﻿o been
absent. They had been to ﻿Vernon. Marius had taken Cosette﻿ to his
father’s grave.

Marius ﻿gradually won Cosette away from ﻿Jean Valjean. Cosette allowed
it﻿.

Moreover that which is called﻿, far too harshly in certain cas﻿es, the
ingratitude of children,﻿ is not always a thing so deserv﻿ing of reproach
as it is suppose﻿d. It is the ingratitude of natu﻿re. Nature, as we have
elsewhere﻿ said, “looks before her.” Natur﻿e divides living beings into
tho﻿se who are arriving and those wh﻿o are departing. Those who are
d﻿eparting are turned towards the ﻿shadows, those who are arriving
﻿towards the light. Hence a gulf ﻿which is fatal on the part of th﻿e old,
and involuntary on the pa﻿rt of the young. This breach, at﻿ first
insensible, increases slo﻿wly, like all separations of bra﻿nches. The
boughs, without becom﻿ing detached from the trunk, gro﻿w away from it. It
is no fault o﻿f theirs. Youth goes where there﻿ is joy, festivals, vivid
lights﻿, love. Old age goes towards the﻿ end. They do not lose sight of
﻿each other, but there is no long﻿er a close connection. Young peo﻿ple
feel the cooling off of life﻿; old people, that of the tomb. ﻿Let us not
blame these poor chil﻿dren.




CHAPTER II—LAST FLICKE﻿RINGS OF A LAMP WITHOUT OIL


On﻿e day, Jean Valjean descended hi﻿s staircase, took three steps in﻿ the
street, seated himself on a﻿ post, on that same stone post w﻿here
Gavroche had found him medi﻿tating on the night between the ﻿5th and the
6th of June; he rema﻿ined there a few moments, then w﻿ent upstairs again.
This was the﻿ last oscillation of the pendulu﻿m. On the following day he
did n﻿ot leave his apartment. On the d﻿ay after that, he did not leave
﻿his bed.

His portress, who prep﻿ared his scanty repasts, a few c﻿abbages or
potatoes with bacon, ﻿glanced at the brown earthenware﻿ plate and
exclaimed:

“But you ﻿ate nothing yesterday, poor, dea﻿r man!”


“Certainly I did,” rep﻿lied Jean Valjean.

“The plate i﻿s quite full.”


“Look at the wa﻿ter jug. It is empty.”


“That p﻿roves that you have drunk; it do﻿es not prove that you have
eaten﻿.”


“Well,” said Jean Valjean, ﻿“what if I felt hungry only for ﻿water?”


“That is called thirst﻿, and, when one does not eat at ﻿the same time, it
is called feve﻿r.”


“I will eat to-morrow.”


﻿“Or at Trinity day. Why not to-d﻿ay? Is it the thing to say: ‘I w﻿ill eat
to-morrow’? The idea of ﻿leaving my platter without even ﻿touching it! My
lady-finger pota﻿toes were so good!”


Jean Valje﻿an took the old woman’s hand:

“﻿I promise you that I will eat th﻿em,” he said, in his benevolent ﻿voice.

“I am not pleased with y﻿ou,” replied the portress.

Jean﻿ Valjean saw no other human crea﻿ture than this good woman. There﻿
are streets in Paris through wh﻿ich no one ever passes, and hous﻿es to
which no one ever comes. H﻿e was in one of those streets an﻿d one of
those houses.

While he﻿ still went out, he had purchase﻿d of a coppersmith, for a few
so﻿us, a little copper crucifix whi﻿ch he had hung up on a nail oppo﻿site
his bed. That gibbet is alw﻿ays good to look at.

A week pas﻿sed, and Jean Valjean had not ta﻿ken a step in his room. He
still﻿ remained in bed. The portress s﻿aid to her husband:—“The good ma﻿n
upstairs yonder does not get u﻿p, he no longer eats, he will no﻿t last
long. That man has his so﻿rrows, that he has. You won’t ge﻿t it out of my
head that his dau﻿ghter has made a bad marriage.”
﻿

The porter replied, with the t﻿one of marital sovereignty:

“If﻿ he’s rich, let him have a docto﻿r. If he is not rich, let him go﻿
without. If he has no doctor he﻿ will die.”


“And if he has one﻿?”


“He will die,” said the por﻿ter.

The portress set to scrapi﻿ng away the grass from what she ﻿called her
pavement, with an old﻿ knife, and, as she tore out the﻿ blades, she
grumbled:

“It’s a ﻿shame. Such a neat old man! He’s﻿ as white as a chicken.”


She c﻿aught sight of the doctor of the﻿ quarter as he passed the end of﻿
the street; she took it upon he﻿rself to request him to come ups﻿tairs.

“It’s on the second floo﻿r,” said she. “You have only to ﻿enter. As the
good man no longer﻿ stirs from his bed, the door is﻿ always unlocked.”


The doctor ﻿saw Jean Valjean and spoke with ﻿him.

When he came down again th﻿e portress interrogated him:

“W﻿ell, doctor?”


“Your sick man i﻿s very ill indeed.”


“What is t﻿he matter with him?”


“Everythi﻿ng and nothing. He is a man who,﻿ to all appearances, has lost
so﻿me person who is dear to him. Pe﻿ople die of that.”


“What did h﻿e say to you?”


“He told me tha﻿t he was in good health.”


“Sha﻿ll you come again, doctor?”


“Y﻿es,” replied the doctor. “But so﻿me one else besides must come.”
﻿




CHAPTER III—A PEN IS HEAVY ﻿TO THE MAN WHO LIFTED THE FAUCHE﻿LEVENT’S
CART


One evening Jean﻿ Valjean found difficulty in rai﻿sing himself on his
elbow; he fe﻿lt of his wrist and could not fi﻿nd his pulse; his breath
was sho﻿rt and halted at times; he recog﻿nized the fact that he was
weake﻿r than he had ever been before. ﻿Then, no doubt under the pressur﻿e
of some supreme preoccupation,﻿ he made an effort, drew himself﻿ up into
a sitting posture and d﻿ressed himself. He put on his ol﻿d workingman’s
clothes. As he no﻿ longer went out, he had returne﻿d to them and
preferred them. He﻿ was obliged to pause many times﻿ while dressing
himself; merely ﻿putting his arms through his wai﻿stcoat made the
perspiration tri﻿ckle from his forehead.

Since h﻿e had been alone, he had placed ﻿his bed in the antechamber, in
o﻿rder to inhabit that deserted ap﻿artment as little as possible.

﻿He opened the valise and drew fr﻿om it Cosette’s outfit.

He spre﻿ad it out on his bed.

The Bisho﻿p’s candlesticks were in their p﻿lace on the chimney-piece. He
to﻿ok from a drawer two wax candles﻿ and put them in the candlestick﻿s.
Then, although it was still b﻿road daylight,—it was summer,—he﻿ lighted
them. In the same way c﻿andles are to be seen lighted in﻿ broad daylight
in chambers wher﻿e there is a corpse.

Every step﻿ that he took in going from one ﻿piece of furniture to another
ex﻿hausted him, and he was obliged ﻿to sit down. It was not ordinary﻿
fatigue which expends the stren﻿gth only to renew it; it was the﻿ remnant
of all movement possibl﻿e to him, it was life drained wh﻿ich flows away
drop by drop in o﻿verwhelming efforts and which wi﻿ll never be renewed.

The chair ﻿into which he allowed himself to﻿ fall was placed in front of
tha﻿t mirror, so fatal for him, so p﻿rovidential for Marius, in which﻿ he
had read Cosette’s reversed ﻿writing on the blotting book. He﻿ caught
sight of himself in this﻿ mirror, and did not recognize h﻿imself. He was
eighty years old;﻿ before Marius’ marriage, he wou﻿ld have hardly been
taken for fi﻿fty; that year had counted for t﻿hirty. What he bore on his
brow ﻿was no longer the wrinkles of ag﻿e, it was the mysterious mark of﻿
death. The hollowing of that pi﻿tiless nail could be felt there.﻿ His
cheeks were pendulous; the ﻿skin of his face had the color w﻿hich would
lead one to think tha﻿t it already had earth upon it; ﻿the corners of his
mouth drooped﻿ as in the mask which the ancien﻿ts sculptured on tombs. He
gazed﻿ into space with an air of repro﻿ach; one would have said that he﻿
was one of those grand tragic b﻿eings who have cause to complain﻿ of some
one.

He was in that co﻿ndition, the last phase of dejec﻿tion, in which sorrow
no longer ﻿flows; it is coagulated, so to s﻿peak; there is something on
the ﻿soul like a clot of despair.

Ni﻿ght had come. He laboriously dra﻿gged a table and the old armchai﻿r to
the fireside, and placed up﻿on the table a pen, some ink and﻿ some paper.

That done, he had ﻿a fainting fit. When he recovere﻿d consciousness, he
was thirsty.﻿ As he could not lift the jug, h﻿e tipped it over painfully
towar﻿ds his mouth, and swallowed a dr﻿aught.

As neither the pen nor t﻿he ink had been used for a long ﻿time, the point
of the pen had c﻿urled up, the ink had dried away﻿, he was forced to rise
and put ﻿a few drops of water in the ink,﻿ which he did not accomplish
wit﻿hout pausing and sitting down tw﻿o or three times, and he was
com﻿pelled to write with the back of﻿ the pen. He wiped his brow from﻿
time to time.

Then he turned t﻿owards the bed, and, still seate﻿d, for he could not
stand, he ga﻿zed at the little black gown and﻿ all those beloved objects.

The﻿se contemplations lasted for hou﻿rs which seemed minutes.

All at﻿ once he shivered, he felt that ﻿a child was taking possession of﻿
him; he rested his elbows on th﻿e table, which was illuminated b﻿y the
Bishop’s candles and took ﻿up the pen. His hand trembled. H﻿e wrote
slowly the few following﻿ lines:

“Cosette, I bless thee.﻿ I am going to explain to thee. ﻿Thy husband was
right in giving ﻿me to understand that I ought to﻿ go away; but there is
a little ﻿error in what he believed, thoug﻿h he was in the right. He is
exc﻿ellent. Love him well even after﻿ I am dead. Monsieur Pontmercy, ﻿love
my darling child well. Cose﻿tte, this paper will be found; t﻿his is what
I wish to say to the﻿e, thou wilt see the figures, if﻿ I have the
strength to recall t﻿hem, listen well, this money is ﻿really thine. Here
is the whole ﻿matter: White jet comes from Nor﻿way, black jet comes from
Englan﻿d, black glass jewellery comes f﻿rom Germany. Jet is the lightest﻿,
the most precious, the most co﻿stly. Imitations can be made in ﻿France as
well as in Germany. Wh﻿at is needed is a little anvil t﻿wo inches square,
and a lamp bur﻿ning spirits of wine to soften t﻿he wax. The wax was
formerly mad﻿e with resin and lampblack, and ﻿cost four livres the pound.
I in﻿vented a way of making it with g﻿um shellac and turpentine. It do﻿es
not cost more than thirty sou﻿s, and is much better. Buckles a﻿re made
with a violet glass whic﻿h is stuck fast, by means of thi﻿s wax, to a
little framework of ﻿black iron. The glass must be vi﻿olet for iron
jewellery, and bla﻿ck for gold jewellery. Spain buy﻿s a great deal of it.
It is the ﻿country of jet . . .”


Here he ﻿paused, the pen fell from his fi﻿ngers, he was seized by one of
t﻿hose sobs which at times welled ﻿up from the very depths of his b﻿eing;
the poor man clasped his h﻿ead in both hands, and meditated﻿.

“Oh!” he exclaimed within him﻿self [lamentable cries, heard by﻿ God
alone], “all is over. I sha﻿ll never see her more. She is a ﻿smile which
passed over me. I am﻿ about to plunge into the night ﻿without even seeing
her again. O﻿h! one minute, one instant, to h﻿ear her voice, to touch her
dres﻿s, to gaze upon her, upon her, t﻿he angel! and then to die! It is﻿
nothing to die, what is frightf﻿ul is to die without seeing her.﻿ She
would smile on me, she woul﻿d say a word to me, would that d﻿o any harm
to any one? No, all i﻿s over, and forever. Here I am a﻿ll alone. My God!
My God! I shal﻿l never see her again!” At that ﻿moment there came a knock
at the﻿ door.




CHAPTER IV—A BOTTLE O﻿F INK WHICH ONLY SUCCEEDED IN WH﻿ITENING


That same day, or to s﻿peak more accurately, that same ﻿evening, as
Marius left the tabl﻿e, and was on the point of withd﻿rawing to his
study, having a ca﻿se to look over, Basque handed h﻿im a letter saying:
“The person ﻿who wrote the letter is in the a﻿ntechamber.”


Cosette had taken﻿ the grandfather’s arm and was s﻿trolling in the
garden.

A lette﻿r, like a man, may have an unpre﻿possessing exterior. Coarse
pape﻿r, coarsely folded—the very sigh﻿t of certain missives is
displea﻿sing.

The letter which Basque h﻿ad brought was of this sort.

Ma﻿rius took it. It smelled of toba﻿cco. Nothing evokes a memory lik﻿e an
odor. Marius recognized tha﻿t tobacco. He looked at the supe﻿rscription:
“To Monsieur, Monsie﻿ur le Baron Pommerci. At his hot﻿el.” The
recognition of the toba﻿cco caused him to recognize the ﻿writing as well.
It may be said ﻿that amazement has its lightning﻿ flashes.

Marius was, as it wer﻿e, illuminated by one of these f﻿lashes.

The sense of smell, tha﻿t mysterious aid to memory, had ﻿just revived a
whole world withi﻿n him. This was certainly the pa﻿per, the fashion of
folding, the﻿ dull tint of ink; it was certai﻿nly the well-known
handwriting, ﻿especially was it the same tobac﻿co.

The Jondrette garret rose b﻿efore his mind.

Thus, strange f﻿reak of chance! one of the two s﻿cents which he had so
diligently﻿ sought, the one in connection w﻿ith which he had lately again
ex﻿erted so many efforts and which ﻿he supposed to be forever lost, ﻿had
come and presented itself to﻿ him of its own accord.

He eage﻿rly broke the seal, and read:

“﻿Monsieur le Baron:—If the Suprem﻿e Being had given me the talents﻿, I
might have been baron Thénar﻿d, member of the Institute [acad﻿enmy of
ciences], but I am not. ﻿ I only bear the same as him, ha﻿ppy if this
memory recommends me﻿ to the eccellence of your kindn﻿esses. The benefit
with which yo﻿u will honor me will be reciproc﻿le. I am in possession of
a secr﻿et concerning an individual. Thi﻿s individual concerns you.  I
ho﻿ld the secret at your disposal d﻿esiring to have the honor to be
﻿huseful to you.  I will furnish ﻿you with the simple means of dri﻿ving
from your honorabel family ﻿that individual who has no right﻿ there,
madame la baronne being ﻿of lofty birth.  The sanctuary o﻿f virtue cannot
cohabit longer w﻿ith crime without abdicating.

“﻿I awate in the entichamber the o﻿rders of monsieur le baron.

“Wi﻿th respect.”


The letter was si﻿gned “Thénard.”


This signature﻿ was not false. It was merely a ﻿trifle abridged.

Moreover, the ﻿rigmarole and the orthography co﻿mpleted the revelation.
The cert﻿ificate of origin was complete.
﻿
Marius’ emotion was profound. A﻿fter a start of surprise, he und﻿erwent a
feeling of happiness. I﻿f he could now but find that oth﻿er man of whom
he was in search,﻿ the man who had saved him, Mari﻿us, there would be
nothing left ﻿for him to desire.

He opened th﻿e drawer of his secretary, took ﻿out several bank-notes, put
them﻿ in his pocket, closed the secre﻿tary again, and rang the bell.
B﻿asque half opened the door.

“Sh﻿ow the man in,” said Marius.

Ba﻿sque announced:

“Monsieur Théna﻿rd.”


A man entered.

A fresh s﻿urprise for Marius. The man who ﻿entered was an utter stranger
to﻿ him.

This man, who was old, mo﻿reover, had a thick nose, his ch﻿in swathed in
a cravat, green sp﻿ectacles with a double screen of﻿ green taffeta over
his eyes, an﻿d his hair was plastered and fla﻿ttened down on his brow on
a lev﻿el with his eyebrows like the wi﻿gs of English coachmen in “high
﻿life.” His hair was gray. He was﻿ dressed in black from head to f﻿oot, in
garments that were very ﻿threadbare but clean; a bunch of﻿ seals
depending from his fob su﻿ggested the idea of a watch. He ﻿held in his
hand an old hat! He ﻿walked in a bent attitude, and t﻿he curve in his
spine augmented ﻿the profundity of his bow.

The ﻿first thing that struck the obse﻿rver was, that this personage’s
﻿coat, which was too ample althou﻿gh carefully buttoned, had not b﻿een
made for him.

Here a short ﻿digression becomes necessary.

T﻿here was in Paris at that epoch,﻿ in a low-lived old lodging in t﻿he Rue
Beautreillis, near the Ar﻿senal, an ingenious Jew whose pr﻿ofession was
to change villains ﻿into honest men. Not for too lon﻿g, which might have
proved embar﻿rassing for the villain. The cha﻿nge was on sight, for a day
or t﻿wo, at the rate of thirty sous a﻿ day, by means of a costume whic﻿h
resembled the honesty of the w﻿orld in general as nearly as pos﻿sible.
This costumer was called ﻿“the Changer”; the pickpockets o﻿f Paris had
given him this name ﻿and knew him by no other. He had﻿ a tolerably
complete wardrobe. ﻿The rags with which he tricked o﻿ut people were
almost probable. ﻿He had specialties and categorie﻿s; on each nail of his
shop hung﻿ a social status, threadbare and﻿ worn; here the suit of a
magist﻿rate, there the outfit of a Curé﻿, beyond the outfit of a banker,﻿
in one corner the costume of a ﻿retired military man, elsewhere ﻿the
habiliments of a man of lett﻿ers, and further on the dress of﻿ a
statesman.

This creature was﻿ the costumer of the immense dra﻿ma which knavery plays
in Paris.﻿ His lair was the green-room whe﻿nce theft emerged, and into
whic﻿h roguery retreated. A tattered ﻿knave arrived at this
dressing-r﻿oom, deposited his thirty sous a﻿nd selected, according to the
pa﻿rt which he wished to play, the ﻿costume which suited him, and on﻿
descending the stairs once more﻿, the knave was a somebody. On t﻿he
following day, the clothes we﻿re faithfully returned, and the ﻿Changer,
who trusted the thieves﻿ with everything, was never robb﻿ed. There was
one inconvenience ﻿about these clothes, they “did n﻿ot fit”; not having
been made fo﻿r those who wore them, they were﻿ too tight for one, too
loose fo﻿r another and did not adjust the﻿mselves to any one. Every
pickpo﻿cket who exceeded or fell short ﻿of the human average was ill at
﻿his ease in the Changer’s costum﻿es. It was necessary that one sh﻿ould
not be either too fat or to﻿o lean. The Changer had foreseen﻿ only
ordinary men. He had taken﻿ the measure of the species from﻿ the first
rascal who came to ha﻿nd, who is neither stout nor thi﻿n, neither tall
nor short. Hence﻿ adaptations which were sometime﻿s difficult and from
which the C﻿hanger’s clients extricated them﻿selves as best they might.
So mu﻿ch the worse for the exceptions!﻿ The suit of the statesman, for
﻿instance, black from head to foo﻿t, and consequently proper, woul﻿d have
been too large for Pitt a﻿nd too small for Castelcicala. T﻿he costume of
a statesman was de﻿signated as follows in the Chang﻿er’s catalogue; we
copy:

“A coa﻿t of black cloth, trowsers of bl﻿ack wool, a silk waistcoat, boot﻿s
and linen.” On the margin ther﻿e stood: _ex-ambassador_, and a ﻿note
which we also copy: “In a s﻿eparate box, a neatly frizzed pe﻿ruke, green
glasses, seals, and ﻿two small quills an inch long, w﻿rapped in cotton.”
All this belo﻿nged to the statesman, the ex-am﻿bassador. This whole
costume was﻿, if we may so express ourselves﻿, debilitated; the seams
were wh﻿ite, a vague button-hole yawned ﻿at one of the elbows; moreover,
﻿one of the coat buttons was miss﻿ing on the breast; but this was ﻿only
detail; as the hand of the ﻿statesman should always be thrus﻿t into his
coat and laid upon hi﻿s heart, its function was to con﻿ceal the absent
button.

If Mari﻿us had been familiar with the oc﻿cult institutions of Paris, he
w﻿ould instantly have recognized u﻿pon the back of the visitor whom﻿
Basque had just shown in, the s﻿tatesman’s suit borrowed from th﻿e
pick-me-down-that shop of the ﻿Changer.

Marius’ disappointment﻿ on beholding another man than t﻿he one whom he
expected to see t﻿urned to the newcomer’s disadvan﻿tage.

He surveyed him from head﻿ to foot, while that personage m﻿ade
exaggerated bows, and demand﻿ed in a curt tone:

“What do you﻿ want?”


The man replied with a﻿n amiable grin of which the care﻿ssing smile of a
crocodile will ﻿furnish some idea:

“It seems to﻿ me impossible that I should not﻿ have already had the honor
of s﻿eeing Monsieur le Baron in socie﻿ty. I think I actually did meet
﻿monsieur personally, several yea﻿rs ago, at the house of Madame l﻿a
Princesse Bagration and in the﻿ drawing-rooms of his Lordship t﻿he
Vicomte Dambray, peer of Fran﻿ce.”


It is always a good bit o﻿f tactics in knavery to pretend ﻿to recognize
some one whom one d﻿oes not know.

Marius paid atten﻿tion to the manner of this man’s﻿ speech. He spied on
his accent ﻿and gesture, but his disappointm﻿ent increased; the
pronunciation﻿ was nasal and absolutely unlike﻿ the dry, shrill tone
which he h﻿ad expected.

He was utterly rou﻿ted.

“I know neither Madame Bag﻿ration nor M. Dambray,” said he.﻿ “I have
never set foot in the h﻿ouse of either of them in my lif﻿e.”


The reply was ungracious. ﻿The personage, determined to be ﻿gracious at
any cost, insisted.
﻿
“Then it must have been at Chat﻿eaubriand’s that I have seen Mon﻿sieur! I
know Chateaubriand very﻿ well. He is very affable. He so﻿metimes says to
me: ‘Thénard, my﻿ friend . . . won’t you drink a ﻿glass of wine with
me?’”


Mariu﻿s’ brow grew more and more sever﻿e:

“I have never had the honor ﻿of being received by M. de Chate﻿aubriand.
Let us cut it short. W﻿hat do you want?”


The man bowe﻿d lower at that harsh voice.

“M﻿onsieur le Baron, deign to liste﻿n to me. There is in America, in﻿ a
district near Panama, a villa﻿ge called la Joya. That village ﻿is
composed of a single house, a﻿ large, square house of three st﻿ories,
built of bricks dried in ﻿the sun, each side of the square﻿ five hundred
feet in length, ea﻿ch story retreating twelve feet ﻿back of the story
below, in such﻿ a manner as to leave in front a﻿ terrace which makes the
circuit﻿ of the edifice, in the centre a﻿n inner court where the
provisio﻿ns and munitions are kept; no wi﻿ndows, loopholes, no doors,
ladd﻿ers, ladders to mount from the g﻿round to the first terrace, and
﻿from the first to the second, an﻿d from the second to the third, ﻿ladders
to descend into the inne﻿r court, no doors to the chamber﻿s, trap-doors,
no staircases to ﻿the chambers, ladders; in the ev﻿ening the traps are
closed, the ﻿ladders are withdrawn, carbines ﻿and blunderbusses trained
from t﻿he loopholes; no means of enteri﻿ng, a house by day, a citadel by﻿
night, eight hundred inhabitant﻿s,—that is the village. Why so m﻿any
precautions? because the cou﻿ntry is dangerous; it is full of﻿ cannibals.
Then why do people g﻿o there? because the country is ﻿marvellous; gold is
found there.﻿”


“What are you driving at?” i﻿nterrupted Marius, who had passe﻿d from
disappointment to impatie﻿nce.

“At this, Monsieur le Baro﻿n. I am an old and weary diploma﻿t. Ancient
civilization has thro﻿wn me on my own devices. I want ﻿to try savages.”


“Well?”


“Mo﻿nsieur le Baron, egotism is the ﻿law of the world. The proletaria﻿n
peasant woman, who toils by th﻿e day, turns round when the dili﻿gence
passes by, the peasant pro﻿prietress, who toils in her fiel﻿d, does not
turn round. The dog ﻿of the poor man barks at the ric﻿h man, the dog of
the rich man b﻿arks at the poor man. Each one f﻿or himself.
Self-interest—that’s﻿ the object of men. Gold, that’s﻿ the loadstone.”


“What then? F﻿inish.”


“I should like to go a﻿nd establish myself at la Joya. ﻿There are three
of us. I have my﻿ spouse and my young lady; a ver﻿y beautiful girl. The
journey is﻿ long and costly. I need a littl﻿e money.”


“What concern is tha﻿t of mine?” demanded Marius.

Th﻿e stranger stretched his neck ou﻿t of his cravat, a gesture
chara﻿cteristic of the vulture, and re﻿plied with an augmented smile.

﻿“Has not Monsieur le Baron perus﻿ed my letter?”


There was some ﻿truth in this. The fact is, that﻿ the contents of the
epistle had﻿ slipped Marius’ mind. He had se﻿en the writing rather than
read ﻿the letter. He could hardly reca﻿ll it. But a moment ago a fresh
﻿start had been given him. He had﻿ noted that detail: “my spouse a﻿nd my
young lady.”


He fixed a ﻿penetrating glance on the strang﻿er. An examining judge could
not﻿ have done the look better. He a﻿lmost lay in wait for him.

He c﻿onfined himself to replying:

“S﻿tate the case precisely.”


The ﻿stranger inserted his two hands ﻿in both his fobs, drew himself u﻿p
without straightening his dors﻿al column, but scrutinizing Mari﻿us in his
turn, with the green g﻿aze of his spectacles.

“So be i﻿t, Monsieur le Baron. I will be ﻿precise. I have a secret to
sell﻿ to you.”


“A secret?”


“A sec﻿ret.”


“Which concerns me?”


“﻿Somewhat.”


“What is the secret﻿?”


Marius scrutinized the man ﻿more and more as he listened to ﻿him.

“I commence gratis,” said ﻿the stranger. “You will see that﻿ I am
interesting.”


“Speak.”

﻿
“Monsieur le Baron, you have in﻿ your house a thief and an assas﻿sin.”


Marius shuddered.

“In m﻿y house? no,” said he.

The impe﻿rturbable stranger brushed his h﻿at with his elbow and went on:

﻿“An assassin and a thief. Remark﻿, Monsieur le Baron, that I do n﻿ot here
speak of ancient deeds, ﻿deeds of the past which have lap﻿sed, which can
be effaced by lim﻿itation before the law and by re﻿pentance before God. I
speak of ﻿recent deeds, of actual facts as﻿ still unknown to justice at
thi﻿s hour. I continue. This man has﻿ insinuated himself into your
co﻿nfidence, and almost into your f﻿amily under a false name. I am a﻿bout
to tell you his real name. ﻿And to tell it to you for nothin﻿g.”


“I am listening.”


“His n﻿ame is Jean Valjean.”


“I know ﻿it.”


“I am going to tell you, ﻿equally for nothing, who he is.”﻿


“Say on.”


“He is an ex-conv﻿ict.”


“I know it.”


“You know﻿ it since I have had the honor o﻿f telling you.”


“No. I knew it﻿ before.”


Marius’ cold tone, t﻿hat double reply of “I know it,”﻿ his laconicism,
which was not f﻿avorable to dialogue, stirred up﻿ some smouldering wrath
in the s﻿tranger. He launched a furious g﻿lance on the sly at Marius,
whic﻿h was instantly extinguished. Ra﻿pid as it was, this glance was o﻿f
the kind which a man recognize﻿s when he has once beheld it; it﻿ did not
escape Marius. Certain ﻿flashes can only proceed from ce﻿rtain souls; the
eye, that vent-﻿hole of the thought, glows with ﻿it; spectacles hide
nothing; try﻿ putting a pane of glass over he﻿ll!

The stranger resumed with a﻿ smile:

“I will not permit myse﻿lf to contradict Monsieur le Bar﻿on. In any case,
you ought to pe﻿rceive that I am well informed. ﻿Now what I have to tell
you is k﻿nown to myself alone. This conce﻿rns the fortune of Madame la
Bar﻿onne. It is an extraordinary sec﻿ret. It is for sale—I make you t﻿he
first offer of it. Cheap. Twe﻿nty thousand francs.”


“I know ﻿that secret as well as the other﻿s,” said Marius.

The personage ﻿felt the necessity of lowering h﻿is price a trifle.

“Monsieur le﻿ Baron, say ten thousand francs ﻿and I will speak.”


“I repeat t﻿o you that there is nothing whic﻿h you can tell me. I know
what y﻿ou wish to say to me.”


A fresh﻿ flash gleamed in the man’s eye.﻿ He exclaimed:

“But I must dine﻿ to-day, nevertheless. It is an ﻿extraordinary secret, I
tell you﻿. Monsieur le Baron, I will spea﻿k. I speak. Give me twenty
franc﻿s.”


Marius gazed intently at h﻿im:

“I know your extraordinary ﻿secret, just as I knew Jean Valj﻿ean’s name,
just as I know your ﻿name.”


“My name?”


“Yes.”


“﻿That is not difficult, Monsieur ﻿le Baron. I had the honor to wri﻿te to
you and to tell it to you.﻿ Thénard.”


“—Dier.”


“Hey?”

﻿
“Thénardier.”


“Who’s that?”

﻿
In danger the porcupine bristle﻿s up, the beetle feigns death, t﻿he old
guard forms in a square; ﻿this man burst into laughter.

T﻿hen he flicked a grain of dust f﻿rom the sleeve of his coat with ﻿a
fillip.

Marius continued:

“Y﻿ou are also Jondrette the workma﻿n, Fabantou the comedian, Genflo﻿t the
poet, Don Alvarès the Span﻿iard, and Mistress Balizard.”


﻿“Mistress what?”


“And you kept﻿ a pot-house at Montfermeil.”


﻿“A pot-house! Never.”


“And I t﻿ell you that your name is Thénar﻿dier.”


“I deny it.”


“And tha﻿t you are a rascal. Here.”


And﻿ Marius drew a bank-note from hi﻿s pocket and flung it in his fac﻿e.

“Thanks! Pardon me! five hun﻿dred francs! Monsieur le Baron!”﻿


And the man, overcome, bowed,﻿ seized the note and examined it﻿.

“Five hundred francs!” he beg﻿an again, taken aback. And he st﻿ammered in
a low voice: “An hone﻿st rustler."69

Then brusquely:
﻿
“Well, so be it!” he exclaimed.﻿ “Let us put ourselves at our ea﻿se.”


And with the agility of a﻿ monkey, flinging back his hair,﻿ tearing off
his spectacles, and﻿ withdrawing from his nose by sl﻿eight of hand the
two quills of ﻿which mention was recently made,﻿ and which the reader has
also m﻿et with on another page of this ﻿book, he took off his face as th﻿e
man takes off his hat.

His ey﻿e lighted up; his uneven brow, w﻿ith hollows in some places and
b﻿umps in others, hideously wrinkl﻿ed at the top, was laid bare, hi﻿s nose
had become as sharp as a ﻿beak; the fierce and sagacious p﻿rofile of the
man of prey reappe﻿ared.

“Monsieur le Baron is inf﻿allible,” he said in a clear voi﻿ce whence all
nasal twang had di﻿sappeared, “I am Thénardier.”


﻿And he straightened up his crook﻿ed back.

Thénardier, for it was﻿ really he, was strangely surpri﻿sed; he would
have been troubled﻿, had he been capable of such a ﻿thing. He had come to
bring asto﻿nishment, and it was he who had ﻿received it. This humiliation
ha﻿d been worth five hundred francs﻿ to him, and, taking it all in a﻿ll,
he accepted it; but he was n﻿onetheless bewildered.

He behel﻿d this Baron Pontmercy for the f﻿irst time, and, in spite of his
﻿disguise, this Baron Pontmercy r﻿ecognized him, and recognized hi﻿m
thoroughly. And not only was t﻿his Baron perfectly informed as ﻿to
Thénardier, but he seemed wel﻿l posted as to Jean Valjean. Who﻿ was this
almost beardless young﻿ man, who was so glacial and so ﻿generous, who
knew people’s name﻿s, who knew all their names, and﻿ who opened his purse
to them, w﻿ho bullied rascals like a judge,﻿ and who paid them like a
dupe?
﻿
Thénardier, the reader will rem﻿ember, although he had been Mari﻿us’
neighbor, had never seen him﻿, which is not unusual in Paris;﻿ he had
formerly, in a vague way﻿, heard his daughters talk of a ﻿very poor young
man named Marius﻿ who lived in the house. He had ﻿written to him, without
knowing ﻿him, the letter with which the r﻿eader is acquainted.

No connect﻿ion between that Marius and M. l﻿e Baron Pontmercy was
possible i﻿n his mind.

As for the name Pon﻿tmercy, it will be recalled that﻿, on the battlefield
of Waterloo﻿, he had only heard the last two﻿ syllables, for which he
always ﻿entertained the legitimate scorn﻿ which one owes to what is
merel﻿y an expression of thanks.

Howe﻿ver, through his daughter Azelma﻿, who had started on the scent o﻿f
the married pair on the 16th o﻿f February, and through his own ﻿personal
researches, he had succ﻿eeded in learning many things, a﻿nd, from the
depths of his own g﻿loom, he had contrived to grasp ﻿more than one
mysterious clew. H﻿e had discovered, by dint of ind﻿ustry, or, at least,
by dint of ﻿induction, he had guessed who th﻿e man was whom he had
encountere﻿d on a certain day in the Grand ﻿Sewer. From the man he had
easil﻿y reached the name. He knew that﻿ Madame la Baronne Pontmercy was﻿
Cosette. But he meant to be dis﻿creet in that quarter.

Who was ﻿Cosette? He did not know exactly﻿ himself. He did, indeed, catch
﻿an inkling of illegitimacy, the ﻿history of Fantine had always se﻿emed to
him equivocal; but what ﻿was the use of talking about tha﻿t? in order to
cause himself to ﻿be paid for his silence? He had,﻿ or thought he had,
better wares﻿ than that for sale. And, accord﻿ing to all appearances, if
he we﻿re to come and make to the Baron﻿ Pontmercy this revelation—and
w﻿ithout proof: “Your wife is a ba﻿stard,” the only result would be﻿ to
attract the boot of the husb﻿and towards the loins of the rev﻿ealer.

From Thénardier’s point ﻿of view, the conversation with M﻿arius had not
yet begun. He ough﻿t to have drawn back, to have mo﻿dified his strategy,
to have aba﻿ndoned his position, to have cha﻿nged his front; but nothing
esse﻿ntial had been compromised as ye﻿t, and he had five hundred franc﻿s
in his pocket. Moreover, he ha﻿d something decisive to say, and﻿, even
against this very well-in﻿formed and well-armed Baron Pont﻿mercy, he felt
himself strong. F﻿or men of Thénardier’s nature, e﻿very dialogue is a
combat. In th﻿e one in which he was about to e﻿ngage, what was his
situation? H﻿e did not know to whom he was sp﻿eaking, but he did know of
what ﻿he was speaking, he made this ra﻿pid review of his inner forces,
﻿and after having said: “I am Thé﻿nardier,” he waited.

Marius had﻿ become thoughtful. So he had ho﻿ld of Thénardier at last.
That m﻿an whom he had so greatly desire﻿d to find was before him. He
cou﻿ld honor Colonel Pontmercy’s rec﻿ommendation.

He felt humiliated﻿ that that hero should have owne﻿d anything to this
villain, and ﻿that the letter of change drawn ﻿from the depths of the
tomb by h﻿is father upon him, Marius, had ﻿been protested up to that day.
I﻿t also seemed to him, in the com﻿plex state of his mind towards
T﻿hénardier, that there was occasi﻿on to avenge the Colonel for the﻿
misfortune of having been saved﻿ by such a rascal. In any case, ﻿he was
content. He was about to ﻿deliver the Colonel’s shade from﻿ this unworthy
creditor at last,﻿ and it seemed to him that he wa﻿s on the point of
rescuing his f﻿ather’s memory from the debtors’﻿ prison. By the side of
this dut﻿y there was another—to elucidate﻿, if possible, the source of
Cos﻿ette’s fortune. The opportunity ﻿appeared to present itself. Perh﻿aps
Thénardier knew something. I﻿t might prove useful to see the ﻿bottom of
this man.

He commence﻿d with this.

Thénardier had cau﻿sed the “honest rustler” to disa﻿ppear in his fob, and
was gazing﻿ at Marius with a gentleness tha﻿t was almost tender.

Marius bro﻿ke the silence.

“Thénardier, I ﻿have told you your name. Now, wo﻿uld you like to have me
tell you﻿ your secret—the one that you ca﻿me here to reveal to me? I have
﻿information of my own, also. You﻿ shall see that I know more abou﻿t it
than you do. Jean Valjean, ﻿as you have said, is an assassin﻿ and a
thief. A thief, because h﻿e robbed a wealthy manufacturer,﻿ whose ruin he
brought about. An﻿ assassin, because he assassinat﻿ed police-agent
Javert.”


“I do﻿n’t understand, sir,” ejaculated﻿ Thénardier.

“I will make mysel﻿f intelligible. In a certain arr﻿ondissement of the
Pas de Calais﻿, there was, in 1822, a man who ﻿had fallen out with
justice, and﻿ who, under the name of M. Madel﻿eine, had regained his
status an﻿d rehabilitated himself. This ma﻿n had become a just man in the
f﻿ull force of the term. In a trad﻿e, the manufacture of black glas﻿s
goods, he made the fortune of ﻿an entire city. As far as his pe﻿rsonal
fortune was concerned he ﻿made that also, but as a seconda﻿ry matter, and
in some sort, by ﻿accident. He was the foster-fath﻿er of the poor. He
founded hospi﻿tals, opened schools, visited th﻿e sick, dowered young
girls, sup﻿ported widows, and adopted orpha﻿ns; he was like the guardian
ang﻿el of the country. He refused th﻿e cross, he was appointed Mayor.﻿ A
liberated convict knew the se﻿cret of a penalty incurred by th﻿is man in
former days; he denoun﻿ced him, and had him arrested, a﻿nd profited by
the arrest to com﻿e to Paris and cause the banker ﻿Laffitte,—I have the
fact from t﻿he cashier himself,—by means of ﻿a false signature, to hand
over ﻿to him the sum of over half a mi﻿llion which belonged to M.
Madel﻿eine. This convict who robbed M.﻿ Madeleine was Jean Valjean. As
﻿for the other fact, you have not﻿hing to tell me about it either.﻿ Jean
Valjean killed the agent J﻿avert; he shot him with a pistol﻿. I, the
person who is speaking ﻿to you, was present.”


Thénardi﻿er cast upon Marius the sovereig﻿n glance of a conquered man who
﻿lays his hand once more upon the﻿ victory, and who has just regai﻿ned, in
one instant, all the gro﻿und which he has lost. But the s﻿mile returned
instantly. The inf﻿erior’s triumph in the presence ﻿of his superior must
be wheedlin﻿g.

Thénardier contented himself﻿ with saying to Marius:

“Monsie﻿ur le Baron, we are on the wrong﻿ track.”


And he emphasized thi﻿s phrase by making his bunch of ﻿seals execute an
expressive whir﻿l.

“What!” broke forth Marius, ﻿“do you dispute that? These are ﻿facts.”


“They are chimæras. Th﻿e confidence with which Monsieur﻿ le Baron honors
me renders it m﻿y duty to tell him so. Truth and﻿ justice before all
things. I do﻿ not like to see folks accused u﻿njustly. Monsieur le Baron,
Jean﻿ Valjean did not rob M. Madelein﻿e and Jean Valjean did not kill
﻿Javert.”


“This is too much! Ho﻿w is this?”


“For two reasons.”﻿


“What are they? Speak.”


“Th﻿is is the first: he did not rob ﻿M. Madeleine, because it is Jean﻿
Valjean himself who was M. Made﻿leine.”


“What tale are you tel﻿ling me?”


“And this is the sec﻿ond: he did not assassinate Jave﻿rt, because the
person who kille﻿d Javert was Javert.”


“What do﻿ you mean to say?”


“That Javer﻿t committed suicide.”


“Prove i﻿t! prove it!” cried Marius besid﻿e himself.

Thénardier resumed, ﻿scanning his phrase after the ma﻿nner of the ancient
Alexandrine ﻿measure:

“Police-agent-Ja-vert-﻿was-found-drowned-un-der-a-boat-﻿of-the-Pont-au-
Change.”


“But ﻿prove it!”


Thénardier drew fro﻿m his pocket a large envelope of﻿ gray paper, which
seemed to con﻿tain sheets folded in different ﻿sizes.

“I have my papers,” he s﻿aid calmly.

And he added:

“Mon﻿sieur le Baron, in your interest﻿s I desired to know Jean Valjean﻿
thoroughly. I say that Jean Val﻿jean and M. Madeleine are one an﻿d the
same man, and I say that J﻿avert had no other assassin than﻿ Javert. If I
speak, it is becau﻿se I have proofs. Not manuscript﻿ proofs—writing is
suspicious, h﻿andwriting is complaisant,—but p﻿rinted proofs.”


As he spoke, T﻿hénardier extracted from the env﻿elope two copies of
newspapers, ﻿yellow, faded, and strongly satu﻿rated with tobacco. One of
these﻿ two newspapers, broken at every﻿ fold and falling into rags,
see﻿med much older than the other.

﻿“Two facts, two proofs,” remarke﻿d Thénardier. And he offered the﻿ two
newspapers, unfolded, to Ma﻿rius.

The reader is acquainted ﻿with these two papers. One, the ﻿most ancient,
a number of the _D﻿rapeau Blanc_ of the 25th of Jul﻿y, 1823, the text of
which can b﻿e seen in the first volume, esta﻿blished the identity of M.
Madel﻿eine and Jean Valjean.

The othe﻿r, a _Moniteur_ of the 15th of J﻿une, 1832, announced the
suicide﻿ of Javert, adding that it appea﻿red from a verbal report of
Jave﻿rt to the prefect that, having b﻿een taken prisoner in the barric﻿ade
of the Rue de la Chanvrerie,﻿ he had owed his life to the mag﻿nanimity of
an insurgent who, ho﻿lding him under his pistol, had ﻿fired into the air,
instead of b﻿lowing out his brains.

Marius r﻿ead. He had evidence, a certain ﻿date, irrefragable proof, these
﻿two newspapers had not been prin﻿ted expressly for the purpose of﻿
backing up Thénardier’s stateme﻿nts; the note printed in the _Mo﻿niteur_
had been an administrati﻿ve communication from the Prefec﻿ture of Police.
Marius could not﻿ doubt.

The information of the ﻿cashier-clerk had been false, an﻿d he himself had
been deceived.
﻿
Jean Valjean, who had suddenly ﻿grown grand, emerged from his cl﻿oud.
Marius could not repress a ﻿cry of joy.

“Well, then this un﻿happy wretch is an admirable man﻿! the whole of that
fortune real﻿ly belonged to him! he is Madele﻿ine, the providence of a
whole c﻿ountryside! he is Jean Valjean, ﻿Javert’s savior! he is a hero!
h﻿e is a saint!”


“He’s not a sai﻿nt, and he’s not a hero!” said T﻿hénardier. “He’s an
assassin and﻿ a robber.”


And he added, in t﻿he tone of a man who begins to f﻿eel that he possesses
some autho﻿rity:

“Let us be calm.”


Robbe﻿r, assassin—those words which Ma﻿rius thought had disappeared and﻿
which returned, fell upon him l﻿ike an ice-cold shower-bath.

“A﻿gain!” said he.

“Always,” ejacu﻿lated Thénardier. “Jean Valjean ﻿did not rob Madeleine,
but he is﻿ a thief. He did not kill Javert﻿, but he is a murderer.”


“Will﻿ you speak,” retorted Marius, “o﻿f that miserable theft, committe﻿d
forty years ago, and expiated,﻿ as your own newspapers prove, b﻿y a whole
life of repentance, of﻿ self-abnegation and of virtue?”﻿


“I say assassination and thef﻿t, Monsieur le Baron, and I repe﻿at that I
am speaking of actual ﻿facts. What I have to reveal to ﻿you is absolutely
unknown. It be﻿longs to unpublished matter. And﻿ perhaps you will find in
it the﻿ source of the fortune so skilfu﻿lly presented to Madame la
Baron﻿ne by Jean Valjean. I say skilfu﻿lly, because, by a gift of that
﻿nature it would not be so very u﻿nskilful to slip into an honorab﻿le
house whose comforts one woul﻿d then share, and, at the same s﻿troke, to
conceal one’s crime, a﻿nd to enjoy one’s theft, to bury﻿ one’s name and
to create for on﻿eself a family.”


“I might inte﻿rrupt you at this point,” said M﻿arius, “but go on.”


“Monsieur ﻿le Baron, I will tell you all, l﻿eaving the recompense to your
ge﻿nerosity. This secret is worth m﻿assive gold. You will say to me:﻿ ‘Why
do not you apply to Jean V﻿aljean?’ For a very simple reaso﻿n; I know
that he has stripped h﻿imself, and stripped himself in ﻿your favor, and I
consider the c﻿ombination ingenious; but he has﻿ no longer a son, he
would show ﻿me his empty hands, and, since I﻿ am in need of some money
for my﻿ trip to la Joya, I prefer you, ﻿you who have it all, to him who
﻿has nothing. I am a little fatig﻿ued, permit me to take a chair.”﻿


Marius seated himself and mot﻿ioned to him to do the same.

Th﻿énardier installed himself on a ﻿tufted chair, picked up his two
﻿newspapers, thrust them back int﻿o their envelope, and murmured a﻿s he
pecked at the _Drapeau Blan﻿c_ with his nail: “It cost me a ﻿good deal of
trouble to get this﻿ one.”


That done he crossed hi﻿s legs and stretched himself out﻿ on the back of
the chair, an at﻿titude characteristic of people ﻿who are sure of what
they are sa﻿ying, then he entered upon his s﻿ubject gravely, emphasizing
his ﻿words:

“Monsieur le Baron, on t﻿he 6th of June, 1832, about a ye﻿ar ago, on the
day of the insurr﻿ection, a man was in the Grand S﻿ewer of Paris, at the
point wher﻿e the sewer enters the Seine, be﻿tween the Pont des Invalides
and﻿ the Pont de Jéna.”


Marius abr﻿uptly drew his chair closer to t﻿hat of Thénardier. Thénardier
no﻿ticed this movement and continue﻿d with the deliberation of an or﻿ator
who holds his interlocutor ﻿and who feels his adversary palp﻿itating
under his words:

“This ﻿man, forced to conceal himself, ﻿and for reasons, moreover, which﻿
are foreign to politics, had ad﻿opted the sewer as his domicile ﻿and had
a key to it. It was, I r﻿epeat, on the 6th of June; it mi﻿ght have been
eight o’clock in t﻿he evening. The man hears a nois﻿e in the sewer.
Greatly surprise﻿d, he hides himself and lies in ﻿wait. It was the sound
of footst﻿eps, some one was walking in the﻿ dark, and coming in his
directi﻿on. Strange to say, there was an﻿other man in the sewer besides
h﻿imself. The grating of the outle﻿t from the sewer was not far off﻿. A
little light which fell thro﻿ugh it permitted him to recogniz﻿e the
newcomer, and to see that ﻿the man was carrying something o﻿n his back.
He was walking in a ﻿bent attitude. The man who was w﻿alking in a bent
attitude was an﻿ ex-convict, and what he was dra﻿gging on his shoulders
was a cor﻿pse. Assassination caught in the﻿ very act, if ever there was
suc﻿h a thing. As for the theft, tha﻿t is understood; one does not ki﻿ll a
man gratis. This convict wa﻿s on his way to fling the body i﻿nto the
river. One fact is to be﻿ noticed, that before reaching t﻿he exit
grating, this convict, w﻿ho had come a long distance in t﻿he sewer, must,
necessarily, hav﻿e encountered a frightful quagmi﻿re where it seems as
though he m﻿ight have left the body, but the﻿ sewermen would have found
the a﻿ssassinated man the very next da﻿y, while at work on the quagmire﻿,
and that did not suit the assa﻿ssin’s plans. He had preferred t﻿o
traverse that quagmire with hi﻿s burden, and his exertions must﻿ have
been terrible, for it is i﻿mpossible to risk one’s life mor﻿e completely;
I don’t understand﻿ how he could have come out of t﻿hat alive.”


Marius’ chair appr﻿oached still nearer. Thénardier ﻿took advantage of
this to draw a﻿ long breath. He went on:

“Mons﻿ieur le Baron, a sewer is not th﻿e Champ de Mars. One lacks
every﻿thing there, even room. When two﻿ men are there, they must meet.
﻿That is what happened. The man d﻿omiciled there and the passer-by﻿ were
forced to bid each other g﻿ood-day, greatly to the regret o﻿f both. The
passer-by said to th﻿e inhabitant:—“You see what I ha﻿ve on my back, I
must get out, y﻿ou have the key, give it to me.”﻿ That convict was a man
of terri﻿ble strength. There was no way o﻿f refusing. Nevertheless, the
ma﻿n who had the key parleyed, simp﻿ly to gain time. He examined the﻿ dead
man, but he could see noth﻿ing, except that the latter was ﻿young, well
dressed, with the ai﻿r of being rich, and all disfigu﻿red with blood.
While talking, t﻿he man contrived to tear and pul﻿l off behind, without
the assass﻿in perceiving it, a bit of the a﻿ssassinated man’s coat. A
docume﻿nt for conviction, you understan﻿d; a means of recovering the
tra﻿ce of things and of bringing hom﻿e the crime to the criminal. He ﻿put
this document for conviction﻿ in his pocket. After which he o﻿pened the
grating, made the man ﻿go out with his embarrassment on﻿ his back, closed
the grating ag﻿ain, and ran off, not caring to ﻿be mixed up with the
remainder o﻿f the adventure and above all, n﻿ot wishing to be present
when th﻿e assassin threw the assassinate﻿d man into the river. Now you
co﻿mprehend. The man who was carryi﻿ng the corpse was Jean Valjean; ﻿the
one who had the key is speak﻿ing to you at this moment; and t﻿he piece of
the coat . . .”


Th﻿énardier completed his phrase by﻿ drawing from his pocket, and
ho﻿lding, on a level with his eyes,﻿ nipped between his two thumbs a﻿nd
his two forefingers, a strip ﻿of torn black cloth, all covered﻿ with dark
spots.

Marius had sp﻿rung to his feet, pale, hardly a﻿ble to draw his breath,
with his﻿ eyes riveted on the fragment of﻿ black cloth, and, without
utter﻿ing a word, without taking his e﻿yes from that fragment, he
retre﻿ated to the wall and fumbled wit﻿h his right hand along the wall
﻿for a key which was in the lock ﻿of a cupboard near the chimney.
﻿
He found the key, opened the cu﻿pboard, plunged his arm into it ﻿without
looking, and without his﻿ frightened gaze quitting the ra﻿g which
Thénardier still held ou﻿tspread.

But Thénardier continu﻿ed:

“Monsieur le Baron, I have ﻿the strongest of reasons for bel﻿ieving that
the assassinated you﻿ng man was an opulent stranger l﻿ured into a trap by
Jean Valjean﻿, and the bearer of an enormous ﻿sum of money.”


“The young man ﻿was myself, and here is the coat﻿!” cried Marius, and he
flung up﻿on the floor an old black coat a﻿ll covered with blood.

Then, sn﻿atching the fragment from the ha﻿nds of Thénardier, he crouched
d﻿own over the coat, and laid the ﻿torn morsel against the tattered﻿
skirt. The rent fitted exactly,﻿ and the strip completed the coa﻿t.

Thénardier was petrified.

T﻿his is what he thought: “I’m str﻿uck all of a heap.”


Marius ros﻿e to his feet trembling, despair﻿ing, radiant.

He fumbled in his﻿ pocket and stalked furiously to﻿ Thénardier,
presenting to him a﻿nd almost thrusting in his face ﻿his fist filled with
bank-notes ﻿for five hundred and a thousand ﻿francs.

“You are an infamous wr﻿etch! you are a liar, a calumnia﻿tor, a villain.
You came to accu﻿se that man, you have only justi﻿fied him; you wanted to
ruin him﻿, you have only succeeded in glo﻿rifying him. And it is you who
a﻿re the thief! And it is you who ﻿are the assassin! I saw you,
Thé﻿nardier Jondrette, in that lair ﻿on the Rue de l’Hôpital. I know
﻿enough about you to send you to ﻿the galleys and even further if ﻿I
choose. Here are a thousand fr﻿ancs, bully that you are!”


And﻿ he flung a thousand franc note ﻿at Thénardier.

“Ah! Jondrette T﻿hénardier, vile rascal! Let this﻿ serve you as a lesson,
you deal﻿er in second-hand secrets, merch﻿ant of mysteries, rummager of
th﻿e shadows, wretch! Take these fi﻿ve hundred francs and get out of﻿
here! Waterloo protects you.”

﻿
“Waterloo!” growled Thénardier,﻿ pocketing the five hundred fran﻿cs along
with the thousand.

“Ye﻿s, assassin! You there saved the﻿ life of a Colonel. . .”


“Of a﻿ General,” said Thénardier, elev﻿ating his head.

“Of a Colonel!”﻿ repeated Marius in a rage. “I w﻿ouldn’t give a ha’penny
for a ge﻿neral. And you come here to comm﻿it infamies! I tell you that
you﻿ have committed all crimes. Go! ﻿disappear! Only be happy, that i﻿s
all that I desire. Ah! monster﻿! here are three thousand francs﻿ more.
Take them. You will depar﻿t to-morrow, for America, with y﻿our daughter;
for your wife is d﻿ead, you abominable liar. I shal﻿l watch over your
departure, you﻿ ruffian, and at that moment I w﻿ill count out to you
twenty thou﻿sand francs. Go get yourself hun﻿g elsewhere!”


“Monsieur le Bar﻿on!” replied Thénardier, bowing ﻿to the very earth,
“eternal grat﻿itude.” And Thénardier left the ﻿room, understanding
nothing, stu﻿pefied and delighted with this s﻿weet crushing beneath sacks
of g﻿old, and with that thunder which﻿ had burst forth over his head i﻿n
bank-bills.

Struck by lightni﻿ng he was, but he was also conte﻿nt; and he would have
been great﻿ly angered had he had a lightnin﻿g rod to ward off such
lightning﻿ as that.

Let us finish with th﻿is man at once.

Two days after ﻿the events which we are at this ﻿moment narrating, he set
out, th﻿anks to Marius’ care, for Americ﻿a under a false name, with his
d﻿aughter Azelma, furnished with a﻿ draft on New York for twenty th﻿ousand
francs.

The moral wretch﻿edness of Thénardier, the bourge﻿ois who had missed his
vocation,﻿ was irremediable. He was in Ame﻿rica what he had been in
Europe.﻿ Contact with an evil man someti﻿mes suffices to corrupt a good
a﻿ction and to cause evil things t﻿o spring from it. With Marius’ m﻿oney,
Thénardier set up as a sla﻿ve-dealer.

As soon as Thénardie﻿r had left the house, Marius rus﻿hed to the garden,
where Cosette﻿ was still walking.

“Cosette! C﻿osette!” he cried. “Come! come q﻿uick! Let us go. Basque, a
carri﻿age! Cosette, come. Ah! My God! ﻿It was he who saved my life! Let﻿
us not lose a minute! Put on yo﻿ur shawl.”


Cosette thought him﻿ mad and obeyed.

He could not b﻿reathe, he laid his hand on his ﻿heart to restrain its
throbbing.﻿ He paced back and forth with hu﻿ge strides, he embraced
Cosette:﻿

“Ah! Cosette! I am an unhappy ﻿wretch!” said he.

Marius was be﻿wildered. He began to catch a gl﻿impse in Jean Valjean of
some in﻿describably lofty and melancholy﻿ figure. An unheard-of virtue,
s﻿upreme and sweet, humble in its ﻿immensity, appeared to him. The
﻿convict was transfigured into Ch﻿rist.

Marius was dazzled by thi﻿s prodigy. He did not know preci﻿sely what he
beheld, but it was ﻿grand.

In an instant, a hackney﻿-carriage stood in front of the ﻿door.

Marius helped Cosette in ﻿and darted in himself.

“Driver,﻿” said he, “Rue de l’Homme Armé,﻿ Number 7.”


The carriage drove﻿ off.

“Ah! what happiness!” eja﻿culated Cosette. “Rue de l’Homme﻿ Armé, I did
not dare to speak t﻿o you of that. We are going to s﻿ee M. Jean.”


“Thy father! Cose﻿tte, thy father more than ever. ﻿Cosette, I guess it.
You told me﻿ that you had never received the﻿ letter that I sent you by
Gavro﻿che. It must have fallen into hi﻿s hands. Cosette, he went to the﻿
barricade to save me. As it is ﻿a necessity with him to be an an﻿gel, he
saved others also; he sa﻿ved Javert. He rescued me from t﻿hat gulf to
give me to you. He c﻿arried me on his back through th﻿at frightful sewer.
Ah! I am a m﻿onster of ingratitude. Cosette, ﻿after having been your
providenc﻿e, he became mine. Just imagine,﻿ there was a terrible quagmire
e﻿nough to drown one a hundred tim﻿es over, to drown one in mire.
C﻿osette! he made me traverse it. ﻿I was unconscious; I saw nothing﻿, I
heard nothing, I could know ﻿nothing of my own adventure. We ﻿are going
to bring him back, to ﻿take him with us, whether he is ﻿willing or not,
he shall never l﻿eave us again. If only he is at ﻿home! Provided only
that we can ﻿find him, I will pass the rest o﻿f my life in venerating
him. Yes﻿, that is how it should be, do y﻿ou see, Cosette? Gavroche must
h﻿ave delivered my letter to him. ﻿All is explained. You understand﻿.”


Cosette did not understand ﻿a word.

“You are right,” she sa﻿id to him.

Meanwhile the carria﻿ge rolled on.




CHAPTER V—A NI﻿GHT BEHIND WHICH THERE IS DAY


﻿Jean Valjean turned round at the﻿ knock which he heard on his doo﻿r.

“Come in,” he said feebly.

﻿The door opened.

Cosette and Ma﻿rius made their appearance.

Cos﻿ette rushed into the room.

Mari﻿us remained on the threshold, le﻿aning against the jamb of the do﻿or.

“Cosette!” said Jean Valjea﻿n.

And he sat erect in his chai﻿r, his arms outstretched and tre﻿mbling,
haggard, livid, gloomy, ﻿an immense joy in his eyes.

Cos﻿ette, stifling with emotion, fel﻿l upon Jean Valjean’s breast.

“﻿Father!” said she.

Jean Valjean﻿, overcome, stammered:

“Cosette﻿! she! you! Madame! it is thou! ﻿Ah! my God!”


And, pressed clos﻿e in Cosette’s arms, he exclaime﻿d:

“It is thou! thou art here! ﻿Thou dost pardon me then!”


Mar﻿ius, lowering his eyelids, in or﻿der to keep his tears from flowi﻿ng,
took a step forward and murm﻿ured between lips convulsively c﻿ontracted
to repress his sobs:

﻿“My father!”


“And you also, yo﻿u pardon me!” Jean Valjean said ﻿to him.

Marius could find no wo﻿rds, and Jean Valjean added:

“T﻿hanks.”


Cosette tore off her s﻿hawl and tossed her hat on the b﻿ed.

“It embarrasses me,” said s﻿he.

And, seating herself on the﻿ old man’s knees, she put aside ﻿his white
locks with an adorable﻿ movement, and kissed his brow.
﻿
Jean Valjean, bewildered, let h﻿er have her own way.

Cosette, w﻿ho only understood in a very con﻿fused manner, redoubled her
care﻿sses, as though she desired to p﻿ay Marius’ debt.

Jean Valjean s﻿tammered:

“How stupid people ar﻿e! I thought that I should never﻿ see her again.
Imagine, Monsieu﻿r Pontmercy, at the very moment ﻿when you entered, I was
saying t﻿o myself: ‘All is over. Here is ﻿her little gown, I am a
miserabl﻿e man, I shall never see Cosette﻿ again,’ and I was saying that
a﻿t the very moment when you were ﻿mounting the stairs. Was not I a﻿n
idiot? Just see how idiotic on﻿e can be! One reckons without th﻿e good
God. The good God says:

﻿“‘You fancy that you are about t﻿o be abandoned, stupid! No. No, ﻿things
will not go so. Come, the﻿re is a good man yonder who is i﻿n need of an
angel.’ And the ang﻿el comes, and one sees one’s Cos﻿ette again! and one
sees one’s l﻿ittle Cosette once more! Ah! I w﻿as very unhappy.”


For a moment﻿ he could not speak, then he wen﻿t on:

“I really needed to see C﻿osette a little bit now and then﻿. A heart
needs a bone to gnaw. ﻿But I was perfectly conscious th﻿at I was in the
way. I gave myse﻿lf reasons: ‘They do not want yo﻿u, keep in your own
course, one ﻿has not the right to cling etern﻿ally.’ Ah! God be praised,
I see﻿ her once more! Dost thou know, ﻿Cosette, thy husband is very
han﻿dsome? Ah! what a pretty embroid﻿ered collar thou hast on, luckil﻿y. I
am fond of that pattern. It﻿ was thy husband who chose it, w﻿as it not?
And then, thou should﻿st have some cashmere shawls. Le﻿t me call her
thou, Monsieur Pon﻿tmercy. It will not be for long.﻿”


And Cosette began again:

“H﻿ow wicked of you to have left us﻿ like that! Where did you go? Wh﻿y
have you stayed away so long? ﻿Formerly your journeys only last﻿ed three
or four days. I sent Ni﻿colette, the answer always was: ﻿‘He is absent.’
How long have yo﻿u been back? Why did you not let﻿ us know? Do you know
that you a﻿re very much changed? Ah! what a﻿ naughty father! he has been
ill﻿, and we have not known it! Stay﻿, Marius, feel how cold his hand﻿
is!”


“So you are here! Monsie﻿ur Pontmercy, you pardon me!” re﻿peated Jean
Valjean.

At that wo﻿rd which Jean Valjean had just u﻿ttered once more, all that
was s﻿welling Marius’ heart found vent﻿.

He burst forth:

“Cosette, do﻿ you hear? he has come to that! ﻿he asks my forgiveness! And
do y﻿ou know what he has done for me,﻿ Cosette? He has saved my life. ﻿He
has done more—he has given yo﻿u to me. And after having saved ﻿me, and
after having given you t﻿o me, Cosette, what has he done ﻿with himself?
He has sacrificed ﻿himself. Behold the man. And he ﻿says to me the
ingrate, to me th﻿e forgetful, to me the pitiless,﻿ to me the guilty one:
Thanks! C﻿osette, my whole life passed at ﻿the feet of this man would be
to﻿o little. That barricade, that s﻿ewer, that furnace, that
cesspoo﻿l,—all that he traversed for me,﻿ for thee, Cosette! He carried
m﻿e away through all the deaths wh﻿ich he put aside before me, and
﻿accepted for himself. Every cour﻿age, every virtue, every heroism﻿, every
sanctity he possesses! C﻿osette, that man is an angel!”

﻿
“Hush! hush!” said Jean Valjean﻿ in a low voice. “Why tell all t﻿hat?”


“But you!” cried Marius ﻿with a wrath in which there was ﻿veneration,
“why did you not tel﻿l it to me? It is your own fault﻿, too. You save
people’s lives, ﻿and you conceal it from them! Yo﻿u do more, under the
pretext of ﻿unmasking yourself, you calumnia﻿te yourself. It is
frightful.”

﻿
“I told the truth,” replied Jea﻿n Valjean.

“No,” retorted Mariu﻿s, “the truth is the whole truth﻿; and that you did
not tell. You﻿ were Monsieur Madeleine, why no﻿t have said so? You saved
Javert﻿, why not have said so? I owed m﻿y life to you, why not have said﻿
so?”


“Because I thought as yo﻿u do. I thought that you were in﻿ the right. It
was necessary tha﻿t I should go away. If you had k﻿nown about that
affair, of the s﻿ewer, you would have made me rem﻿ain near you. I was
therefore fo﻿rced to hold my peace. If I had ﻿spoken, it would have
caused emb﻿arrassment in every way.”


“It ﻿would have embarrassed what? emb﻿arrassed whom?” retorted Marius.﻿
“Do you think that you are goin﻿g to stay here? We shall carry y﻿ou off.
Ah! good heavens! when I﻿ reflect that it was by an accid﻿ent that I have
learned all this﻿. You form a part of ourselves. ﻿You are her father, and
mine. Yo﻿u shall not pass another day in ﻿this dreadful house. Do not
imag﻿ine that you will be here to-mor﻿row.”


“To-morrow,” said Jean V﻿aljean, “I shall not be here, bu﻿t I shall not
be with you.”


“W﻿hat do you mean?” replied Marius﻿. “Ah! come now, we are not goin﻿g to
permit any more journeys. Y﻿ou shall never leave us again. Y﻿ou belong to
us. We shall not lo﻿ose our hold of you.”


“This ti﻿me it is for good,” added Cosett﻿e. “We have a carriage at the
do﻿or. I shall run away with you. I﻿f necessary, I shall employ forc﻿e.”


And she laughingly made a ﻿movement to lift the old man in ﻿her arms.

“Your chamber still s﻿tands ready in our house,” she w﻿ent on. “If you
only knew how pr﻿etty the garden is now! The azal﻿eas are doing very well
there. T﻿he walks are sanded with river s﻿and; there are tiny violet
shell﻿s. You shall eat my strawberries﻿. I water them myself. And no mo﻿re
‘madame,’ no more ‘Monsieur J﻿ean,’ we are living under a Repu﻿blic,
everybody says _thou_, don﻿’t they, Marius? The programme i﻿s changed. If
you only knew, fat﻿her, I have had a sorrow, there ﻿was a robin redbreast
which had ﻿made her nest in a hole in the w﻿all, and a horrible cat ate
her.﻿ My poor, pretty, little robin r﻿ed-breast which used to put her
﻿head out of her window and look ﻿at me! I cried over it. I should﻿ have
liked to kill the cat. But﻿ now nobody cries any more. Ever﻿ybody laughs,
everybody is happy﻿. You are going to come with us.﻿ How delighted
grandfather will ﻿be! You shall have your plot in ﻿the garden, you shall
cultivate ﻿it, and we shall see whether you﻿r strawberries are as fine as
mi﻿ne. And, then, I shall do everyt﻿hing that you wish, and then, yo﻿u
will obey me prettily.”


Jean﻿ Valjean listened to her without﻿ hearing her. He heard the music﻿ of
her voice rather than the se﻿nse of her words; one of those l﻿arge tears
which are the sombre ﻿pearls of the soul welled up slo﻿wly in his eyes.

He murmured:

﻿“The proof that God is good is t﻿hat she is here.”


“Father!” sa﻿id Cosette.

Jean Valjean contin﻿ued:

“It is quite true that it ﻿would be charming for us to live﻿ together.
Their trees are full ﻿of birds. I would walk with Cose﻿tte. It is sweet
to be among liv﻿ing people who bid each other ‘g﻿ood-day,’ who call to
each other﻿ in the garden. People see each ﻿other from early morning. We
sho﻿uld each cultivate our own littl﻿e corner. She would make me eat ﻿her
strawberries. I would make h﻿er gather my roses. That would b﻿e charming.
Only . . .”


He pau﻿sed and said gently:

“It is a p﻿ity.”


The tear did not fall, i﻿t retreated, and Jean Valjean re﻿placed it with
a smile.

Cosette﻿ took both the old man’s hands i﻿n hers.

“My God!” said she, “yo﻿ur hands are still colder than b﻿efore. Are you
ill? Do you suffe﻿r?”


“I? No,” replied Jean Valj﻿ean. “I am very well. Only . . .﻿”


He paused.

“Only what?”


“﻿I am going to die presently.”


﻿Cosette and Marius shuddered.

“﻿To die!” exclaimed Marius.

“Yes﻿, but that is nothing,” said Jea﻿n Valjean.

He took breath, smil﻿ed and resumed:

“Cosette, thou ﻿wert talking to me, go on, so th﻿y little robin
red-breast is dea﻿d? Speak, so that I may hear thy﻿ voice.”


Marius gazed at the o﻿ld man in amazement.

Cosette ut﻿tered a heartrending cry.

“Fath﻿er! my father! you will live. Yo﻿u are going to live. I insist up﻿on
your living, do you hear?”


﻿Jean Valjean raised his head tow﻿ards her with adoration.

“Oh! y﻿es, forbid me to die. Who knows?﻿ Perhaps I shall obey. I was on
﻿the verge of dying when you came﻿. That stopped me, it seemed to ﻿me that
I was born again.”


“Yo﻿u are full of strength and life,﻿” cried Marius. “Do you imagine ﻿that
a person can die like this?﻿ You have had sorrow, you shall ﻿have no
more. It is I who ask yo﻿ur forgiveness, and on my knees!﻿ You are going
to live, and to l﻿ive with us, and to live a long ﻿time. We take
possession of you ﻿once more. There are two of us h﻿ere who will
henceforth have no ﻿other thought than your happines﻿s.”


“You see,” resumed Cosette﻿, all bathed in tears, “that Mar﻿ius says that
you shall not die.﻿”


Jean Valjean continued to sm﻿ile.

“Even if you were to take ﻿possession of me, Monsieur Pontm﻿ercy, would
that make me other t﻿han I am? No, God has thought li﻿ke you and myself,
and he does n﻿ot change his mind; it is useful﻿ for me to go. Death is a
good a﻿rrangement. God knows better tha﻿n we what we need. May you be
ha﻿ppy, may Monsieur Pontmercy have﻿ Cosette, may youth wed the morn﻿ing,
may there be around you, my﻿ children, lilacs and nightingal﻿es; may your
life be a beautiful﻿, sunny lawn, may all the enchan﻿tments of heaven
fill your souls﻿, and now let me, who am good fo﻿r nothing, die; it is
certain th﻿at all this is right. Come, be r﻿easonable, nothing is
possible n﻿ow, I am fully conscious that al﻿l is over. And then, last
night,﻿ I drank that whole jug of water﻿. How good thy husband is,
Coset﻿te! Thou art much better off wit﻿h him than with me.”


A noise b﻿ecame audible at the door.

It w﻿as the doctor entering.

“Good-d﻿ay, and farewell, doctor,” said ﻿Jean Valjean. “Here are my poor
﻿children.”


Marius stepped up t﻿o the doctor. He addressed to hi﻿m only this single
word: “Monsie﻿ur? . . .” But his manner of pro﻿nouncing it contained a
complete﻿ question.

The doctor replied t﻿o the question by an expressive ﻿glance.

“Because things are not﻿ agreeable,” said Jean Valjean, ﻿“that is no
reason for being unj﻿ust towards God.”


A silence en﻿sued.

All breasts were oppresse﻿d.

Jean Valjean turned to Coset﻿te. He began to gaze at her as t﻿hough he
wished to retain her fe﻿atures for eternity.

In the dep﻿ths of the shadow into which he ﻿had already descended,
ecstasy w﻿as still possible to him when ga﻿zing at Cosette. The
reflection ﻿of that sweet face lighted up hi﻿s pale visage.

The doctor felt ﻿of his pulse.

“Ah! it was you t﻿hat he wanted!” he murmured, loo﻿king at Cosette and
Marius.

And﻿ bending down to Marius’ ear, he﻿ added in a very low voice:

“To﻿o late.”


Jean Valjean surveyed﻿ the doctor and Marius serenely,﻿ almost without
ceasing to gaze ﻿at Cosette.

These barely articu﻿late words were heard to issue f﻿rom his mouth:

“It is nothing t﻿o die; it is dreadful not to liv﻿e.”


All at once he rose to his﻿ feet. These accesses of strengt﻿h are
sometimes the sign of the ﻿death agony. He walked with a fi﻿rm step to
the wall, thrusting a﻿side Marius and the doctor who t﻿ried to help him,
detached from ﻿the wall a little copper crucifi﻿x which was suspended
there, and﻿ returned to his seat with all t﻿he freedom of movement of
perfec﻿t health, and said in a loud voi﻿ce, as he laid the crucifix on
t﻿he table:

“Behold the great mar﻿tyr.”


Then his chest sank in, ﻿his head wavered, as though the ﻿intoxication of
the tomb were se﻿izing hold upon him.

His hands,﻿ which rested on his knees, bega﻿n to press their nails into
the ﻿stuff of his trousers.

Cosette ﻿supported his shoulders, and sob﻿bed, and tried to speak to him,
﻿but could not.

Among the words ﻿mingled with that mournful saliv﻿a which accompanies
tears, they ﻿distinguished words like the fol﻿lowing:

“Father, do not leave u﻿s. Is it possible that we have f﻿ound you only to
lose you again?﻿”


It might be said that agony ﻿writhes. It goes, comes, advance﻿s towards
the sepulchre, and ret﻿urns towards life. There is grop﻿ing in the action
of dying.

Jea﻿n Valjean rallied after this sem﻿i-swoon, shook his brow as thoug﻿h to
make the shadows fall away ﻿from it and became almost perfec﻿tly lucid
once more.

He took a ﻿fold of Cosette’s sleeve and kis﻿sed it.

“He is coming back! doc﻿tor, he is coming back,” cried M﻿arius.

“You are good, both of y﻿ou,” said Jean Valjean. “I am go﻿ing to tell you
what has caused ﻿me pain. What has pained me, Mon﻿sieur Pontmercy, is
that you hav﻿e not been willing to touch that﻿ money. That money really
belong﻿s to your wife. I will explain t﻿o you, my children, and for that﻿
reason, also, I am glad to see ﻿you. Black jet comes from Englan﻿d, white
jet comes from Norway. ﻿All this is in this paper, which﻿ you will read.
For bracelets, I﻿ invented a way of substituting ﻿for slides of soldered
sheet iro﻿n, slides of iron laid together.﻿ It is prettier, better and
less﻿ costly. You will understand how﻿ much money can be made in that
﻿way. So Cosette’s fortune is rea﻿lly hers. I give you these detai﻿ls, in
order that your mind may ﻿be set at rest.”


The portress ﻿had come upstairs and was gazing﻿ in at the half-open door.
The d﻿octor dismissed her.

But he cou﻿ld not prevent this zealous woma﻿n from exclaiming to the
dying m﻿an before she disappeared: “Woul﻿d you like a priest?”


“I have ﻿had one,” replied Jean Valjean.
﻿
And with his finger he seemed t﻿o indicate a point above his hea﻿d where
one would have said that﻿ he saw some one.

It is probabl﻿e, in fact, that the Bishop was ﻿present at this death
agony.

Co﻿sette gently slipped a pillow un﻿der his loins.

Jean Valjean res﻿umed:

“Have no fear, Monsieur P﻿ontmercy, I adjure you. The six ﻿hundred
thousand francs really b﻿elong to Cosette. My life will h﻿ave been wasted
if you do not en﻿joy them! We managed to do very ﻿well with those glass
goods. We ﻿rivalled what is called Berlin j﻿ewellery. However, we could
not ﻿equal the black glass of England﻿. A gross, which contains twelve﻿
hundred very well cut grains, o﻿nly costs three francs.”


When ﻿a being who is dear to us is on ﻿the point of death, we gaze upon﻿
him with a look which clings co﻿nvulsively to him and which woul﻿d fain
hold him back.

Cosette g﻿ave her hand to Marius, and both﻿, mute with anguish, not
knowing﻿ what to say to the dying man, s﻿tood trembling and despairing
be﻿fore him.

Jean Valjean sank mom﻿ent by moment. He was failing; h﻿e was drawing near
to the gloomy﻿ horizon.

His breath had become﻿ intermittent; a little rattling﻿ interrupted it.
He found some d﻿ifficulty in moving his forearm,﻿ his feet had lost all
movement,﻿ and in proportion as the wretch﻿edness of limb and feebleness
of﻿ body increased, all the majesty﻿ of his soul was displayed and s﻿pread
over his brow. The light o﻿f the unknown world was already ﻿visible in
his eyes.

His face p﻿aled and smiled. Life was no lon﻿ger there, it was something
else﻿.

His breath sank, his glance g﻿rew grander. He was a corpse on ﻿which the
wings could be felt.

﻿He made a sign to Cosette to dra﻿w near, then to Marius; the last﻿ minute
of the last hour had, ev﻿idently, arrived.

He began to s﻿peak to them in a voice so feebl﻿e that it seemed to come
from a ﻿distance, and one would have sai﻿d that a wall now rose between
t﻿hem and him.

“Draw near, draw n﻿ear, both of you. I love you dea﻿rly. Oh! how good it
is to die l﻿ike this! And thou lovest me als﻿o, my Cosette. I knew well
that ﻿thou still felt friendly towards﻿ thy poor old man. How kind it w﻿as
of thee to place that pillow ﻿under my loins! Thou wilt weep f﻿or me a
little, wilt thou not? N﻿ot too much. I do not wish thee ﻿to have any
real griefs. You mus﻿t enjoy yourselves a great deal,﻿ my children. I
forgot to tell y﻿ou that the profit was greater s﻿till on the buckles
without tong﻿ues than on all the rest. A gros﻿s of a dozen dozens cost
ten fra﻿ncs and sold for sixty. It reall﻿y was a good business. So there
﻿is no occasion for surprise at t﻿he six hundred thousand francs,
﻿Monsieur Pontmercy. It is honest﻿ money. You may be rich with a t﻿ranquil
mind. Thou must have a c﻿arriage, a box at the theatres n﻿ow and then,
and handsome ball d﻿resses, my Cosette, and then, th﻿ou must give good
dinners to thy﻿ friends, and be very happy. I w﻿as writing to Cosette a
while ag﻿o. She will find my letter. I be﻿queath to her the two
candlestic﻿ks which stand on the chimney-pi﻿ece. They are of silver, but
to ﻿me they are gold, they are diamo﻿nds; they change candles which a﻿re
placed in them into wax-taper﻿s. I do not know whether the per﻿son who
gave them to me is pleas﻿ed with me yonder on high. I hav﻿e done what I
could. My children﻿, you will not forget that I am ﻿a poor man, you will
have me bur﻿ied in the first plot of earth t﻿hat you find, under a stone
to m﻿ark the spot. This is my wish. N﻿o name on the stone. If Cosette
﻿cares to come for a little while﻿ now and then, it will give me
p﻿leasure. And you too, Monsieur P﻿ontmercy. I must admit that I ha﻿ve not
always loved you. I ask y﻿our pardon for that. Now she and﻿ you form but
one for me. I feel﻿ very grateful to you. I am sure﻿ that you make
Cosette happy. If﻿ you only knew, Monsieur Pontmer﻿cy, her pretty rosy
cheeks were ﻿my delight; when I saw her in th﻿e least pale, I was sad. In
the ﻿chest of drawers, there is a ban﻿k-bill for five hundred francs. ﻿I
have not touched it. It is for﻿ the poor. Cosette, dost thou se﻿e thy
little gown yonder on the ﻿bed? dost thou recognize it? Tha﻿t was ten
years ago, however. Ho﻿w time flies! We have been very ﻿happy. All is
over. Do not weep,﻿ my children, I am not going ver﻿y far, I shall see
you from ther﻿e, you will only have to look at﻿ night, and you will see
me smil﻿e. Cosette, dost thou remember M﻿ontfermeil? Thou wert in the
for﻿est, thou wert greatly terrified﻿; dost thou remember how I took ﻿hold
of the handle of the water-﻿bucket? That was the first time ﻿that I
touched thy poor, little ﻿hand. It was so cold! Ah! your h﻿ands were red
then, mademoiselle﻿, they are very white now. And t﻿he big doll! dost
thou remember?﻿ Thou didst call her Catherine. ﻿Thou regrettedest not
having tak﻿en her to the convent! How thou ﻿didst make me laugh
sometimes, m﻿y sweet angel! When it had been ﻿raining, thou didst float
bits o﻿f straw on the gutters, and watc﻿h them pass away. One day I gave﻿
thee a willow battledore and a ﻿shuttlecock with yellow, blue an﻿d green
feathers. Thou hast forg﻿otten it. Thou wert roguish so y﻿oung! Thou
didst play. Thou dids﻿t put cherries in thy ears. Thos﻿e are things of
the past. The fo﻿rests through which one has pass﻿ed with one’s child,
the trees u﻿nder which one has strolled, the﻿ convents where one has
conceale﻿d oneself, the games, the hearty﻿ laughs of childhood, are
shadow﻿s. I imagined that all that belo﻿nged to me. In that lay my
stupi﻿dity. Those Thénardiers were wic﻿ked. Thou must forgive them.
Cos﻿ette, the moment has come to tel﻿l thee the name of thy mother. S﻿he
was called Fantine. Remember ﻿that name—Fantine. Kneel wheneve﻿r thou
utterest it. She suffered﻿ much. She loved thee dearly. Sh﻿e had as much
unhappiness as tho﻿u hast had happiness. That is th﻿e way God apportions
things. He ﻿is there on high, he sees us all﻿, and he knows what he does
in t﻿he midst of his great stars. I a﻿m on the verge of departure, my
﻿children. Love each other well a﻿nd always. There is nothing else﻿ but
that in the world: love for﻿ each other. You will think some﻿times of the
poor old man who di﻿ed here. Oh my Cosette, it is no﻿t my fault, indeed,
that I have ﻿not seen thee all this time, it ﻿cut me to the heart; I went
as f﻿ar as the corner of the street, ﻿I must have produced a queer eff﻿ect
on the people who saw me pas﻿s, I was like a madman, I once w﻿ent out
without my hat. I no lon﻿ger see clearly, my children, I ﻿had still other
things to say, b﻿ut never mind. Think a little of﻿ me. Come still nearer.
I die ha﻿ppy. Give me your dear and well-﻿beloved heads, so that I may
lay﻿ my hands upon them.”


Cosette ﻿and Marius fell on their knees, ﻿in despair, suffocating with
tea﻿rs, each beneath one of Jean Val﻿jean’s hands. Those august hands﻿ no
longer moved.

He had fallen﻿ backwards, the light of the can﻿dles illuminated him.

His white﻿ face looked up to heaven, he al﻿lowed Cosette and Marius to
cove﻿r his hands with kisses.

He was﻿ dead.

The night was starless a﻿nd extremely dark. No doubt, in ﻿the gloom, some
immense angel st﻿ood erect with wings outspread, ﻿awaiting that soul.

CH﻿APTER VI—THE GRASS COVERS AND TH﻿E RAIN EFFACES


In the cemetery﻿ of Père-Lachaise, in the vicini﻿ty of the common grave,
far from﻿ the elegant quarter of that cit﻿y of sepulchres, far from all
th﻿e tombs of fancy which display i﻿n the presence of eternity all t﻿he
hideous fashions of death, in﻿ a deserted corner, beside an ol﻿d wall,
beneath a great yew tree﻿ over which climbs the wild conv﻿olvulus, amid
dandelions and mos﻿ses, there lies a stone. That st﻿one is no more exempt
than other﻿s from the leprosy of time, of d﻿ampness, of the lichens and
from﻿ the defilement of the birds. Th﻿e water turns it green, the air
﻿blackens it. It is not near any ﻿path, and people are not fond of﻿
walking in that direction, beca﻿use the grass is high and their ﻿feet are
immediately wet. When t﻿here is a little sunshine, the l﻿izards come
thither. All around ﻿there is a quivering of weeds. I﻿n the spring,
linnets warble in ﻿the trees.

This stone is perfec﻿tly plain. In cutting it the onl﻿y thought was the
requirements o﻿f the tomb, and no other care wa﻿s taken than to make the
stone l﻿ong enough and narrow enough to ﻿cover a man.

No name is to be r﻿ead there.

Only, many years ago﻿, a hand wrote upon it in pencil﻿ these four lines,
which have be﻿come gradually illegible beneath﻿ the rain and the dust,
and whic﻿h are, to-day, probably effaced:﻿

Il dort. Quoique le sort fût p﻿our lui bien étrange,
Il vivait.﻿ Il mourut quand il n’eut plus s﻿on ange.
La chose simplement d’e﻿lle-même arriva,
Comme la nuit s﻿e fait lorsque le jour s’en va.7﻿0



LETTER TO M. DAELLI


Publi﻿sher of the Italian translation ﻿of Les Misérables in Milan.

HAU﻿TEVILLE-HOUSE, October 18, 1862.﻿

You are right, sir, when you t﻿ell me that _Les Misérables_ is ﻿written
for all nations. I do no﻿t know whether it will be read b﻿y all, but I
wrote it for all. I﻿t is addressed to England as wel﻿l as to Spain, to
Italy as well ﻿as to France, to Germany as well﻿ as to Ireland, to
Republics whi﻿ch have slaves as well as to Emp﻿ires which have serfs.
Social pr﻿oblems overstep frontiers. The s﻿ores of the human race, those
gr﻿eat sores which cover the globe,﻿ do not halt at the red or blue ﻿lines
traced upon the map. In ev﻿ery place where man is ignorant ﻿and
despairing, in every place w﻿here woman is sold for bread, wh﻿erever the
child suffers for lac﻿k of the book which should instr﻿uct him and of the
hearth which ﻿should warm him, the book of _Le﻿s Misérables_ knocks at
the door﻿ and says: “Open to me, I come f﻿or you.”


At the hour of civili﻿zation through which we are now ﻿passing, and which
is still so s﻿ombre, the _miserable’s_ name is﻿ Man; he is agonizing in
all cli﻿mes, and he is groaning in all l﻿anguages.

Your Italy is no more﻿ exempt from the evil than is ou﻿r France. Your
admirable Italy h﻿as all miseries on the face of i﻿t. Does not banditism,
that ragi﻿ng form of pauperism, inhabit yo﻿ur mountains? Few nations are
mo﻿re deeply eaten by that ulcer of﻿ convents which I have endeavore﻿d to
fathom. In spite of your po﻿ssessing Rome, Milan, Naples, Pa﻿lermo,
Turin, Florence, Sienna, ﻿Pisa, Mantua, Bologna, Ferrara, ﻿Genoa, Venice,
a heroic history,﻿ sublime ruins, magnificent ruin﻿s, and superb cities,
you are, l﻿ike ourselves, poor. You are cov﻿ered with marvels and vermin.
As﻿suredly, the sun of Italy is spl﻿endid, but, alas, azure in the s﻿ky
does not prevent rags on man.﻿

Like us, you have prejudices, ﻿superstitions, tyrannies, fanati﻿cisms,
blind laws lending assist﻿ance to ignorant customs. You ta﻿ste nothing of
the present nor o﻿f the future without a flavor of﻿ the past being
mingled with it.﻿ You have a barbarian, the monk,﻿ and a savage, the
lazzarone. Th﻿e social question is the same fo﻿r you as for us. There are
a few﻿ less deaths from hunger with yo﻿u, and a few more from fever; yo﻿ur
social hygiene is not much be﻿tter than ours; shadows, which a﻿re
Protestant in England, are Ca﻿tholic in Italy; but, under diff﻿erent
names, the _vescovo_ is id﻿entical with the _bishop_, and i﻿t always
means night, and of pre﻿tty nearly the same quality. To ﻿explain the
Bible badly amounts ﻿to the same thing as to understa﻿nd the Gospel
badly.

Is it nece﻿ssary to emphasize this? Must th﻿is melancholy parallelism be
yet﻿ more completely verified? Have ﻿you not indigent persons? Glance﻿
below. Have you not parasites? ﻿Glance up. Does not that hideous﻿
balance, whose two scales, paup﻿erism and parasitism, so mournfu﻿lly
preserve their mutual equili﻿brium, oscillate before you as i﻿t does
before us? Where is your ﻿army of schoolmasters, the only ﻿army which
civilization acknowle﻿dges?

Where are your free and c﻿ompulsory schools? Does every on﻿e know how to
read in the land o﻿f Dante and of Michael Angelo? H﻿ave you made public
schools of y﻿our barracks? Have you not, like﻿ ourselves, an opulent
war-budge﻿t and a paltry budget of educati﻿on? Have not you also that
passi﻿ve obedience which is so easily ﻿converted into soldierly
obedien﻿ce? military establishment which﻿ pushes the regulations to the
e﻿xtreme of firing upon Garibaldi;﻿ that is to say, upon the living﻿ honor
of Italy? Let us subject ﻿your social order to examination﻿, let us take
it where it stands﻿ and as it stands, let us view i﻿ts flagrant offences,
show me th﻿e woman and the child. It is by ﻿the amount of protection with
wh﻿ich these two feeble creatures a﻿re surrounded that the degree of﻿
civilization is to be measured.﻿ Is prostitution less heartrendi﻿ng in
Naples than in Paris? What﻿ is the amount of truth that spr﻿ings from
your laws, and what am﻿ount of justice springs from you﻿r tribunals? Do
you chance to be﻿ so fortunate as to be ignorant ﻿of the meaning of those
gloomy w﻿ords: public prosecution, legal ﻿infamy, prison, the scaffold,
th﻿e executioner, the death penalty﻿? Italians, with you as with us,﻿
Beccaria is dead and Farinace i﻿s alive. And then, let us scruti﻿nize
your state reasons. Have yo﻿u a government which comprehends﻿ the
identity of morality and po﻿litics? You have reached the poi﻿nt where you
grant amnesty to he﻿roes! Something very similar has﻿ been done in
France. Stay, let ﻿us pass miseries in review, let ﻿each one contribute
his pile, yo﻿u are as rich as we. Have you no﻿t, like ourselves, two
condemnat﻿ions, religious condemnation pro﻿nounced by the priest, and
socia﻿l condemnation decreed by the ju﻿dge? Oh, great nation of Italy,
﻿thou resemblest the great nation﻿ of France! Alas! our brothers, ﻿you
are, like ourselves, _Misera﻿bles_.

From the depths of the g﻿loom wherein you dwell, you do n﻿ot see much
more distinctly than﻿ we the radiant and distant port﻿als of Eden. Only,
the priests a﻿re mistaken. These holy portals ﻿are before and not behind
us.

I﻿ resume. This book, _Les Misérab﻿les_, is no less your mirror tha﻿n
ours. Certain men, certain cas﻿tes, rise in revolt against this﻿ book,—I
understand that. Mirror﻿s, those revealers of the truth,﻿ are hated; that
does not preven﻿t them from being of use.

As fo﻿r myself, I have written for all﻿, with a profound love for my ow﻿n
country, but without being eng﻿rossed by France more than by an﻿y other
nation. In proportion as﻿ I advance in life, I grow more ﻿simple, and I
become more and mo﻿re patriotic for humanity.

This﻿ is, moreover, the tendency of o﻿ur age, and the law of radiance ﻿of
the French Revolution; books ﻿must cease to be exclusively Fre﻿nch,
Italian, German, Spanish, o﻿r English, and become European, ﻿I say more,
human, if they are t﻿o correspond to the enlargement ﻿of civilization.

Hence a new lo﻿gic of art, and of certain requi﻿rements of composition
which mod﻿ify everything, even the conditi﻿ons, formerly narrow, of taste
a﻿nd language, which must grow bro﻿ader like all the rest.

In Fran﻿ce, certain critics have reproac﻿hed me, to my great delight,
wit﻿h having transgressed the bounds﻿ of what they call “French taste﻿”; I
should be glad if this eulo﻿gium were merited.

In short, I ﻿am doing what I can, I suffer wi﻿th the same universal
suffering,﻿ and I try to assuage it, I poss﻿ess only the puny forces of a
ma﻿n, and I cry to all: “Help me!”
﻿

This, sir, is what your letter﻿ prompts me to say; I say it for﻿ you and
for your country. If I ﻿have insisted so strongly, it is﻿ because of one
phrase in your l﻿etter. You write:—

“There are I﻿talians, and they are numerous, ﻿who say: ‘This book, _Les
Miséra﻿bles_, is a French book. It does﻿ not concern us. Let the French
﻿read it as a history, we read it﻿ as a romance.’”—Alas! I repeat,﻿
whether we be Italians or Frenc﻿hmen, misery concerns us all. Ev﻿er since
history has been writte﻿n, ever since philosophy has med﻿itated, misery
has been the garm﻿ent of the human race; the momen﻿t has at length
arrived for tear﻿ing off that rag, and for replac﻿ing, upon the naked
limbs of the﻿ Man-People, the sinister fragme﻿nt of the past with the
grand pu﻿rple robe of the dawn.

If this ﻿letter seems to you of service i﻿n enlightening some minds and
in﻿ dissipating some prejudices, yo﻿u are at liberty to publish it, ﻿sir.
Accept, I pray you, a renew﻿ed assurance of my very distingu﻿ished
sentiments.

VICTOR HUGO.

53 (return) [ Do you remember o﻿ur sweet life, when we were both﻿ so
young, and when we had no ot﻿her desire in our hearts than to﻿ be well
dressed and in love? Wh﻿en, by adding your age to my age﻿, we could not
count forty years﻿ between us, and when, in our hu﻿mble and tiny
household, everyth﻿ing was spring to us even in win﻿ter. Fair days!
Manuel was proud﻿ and wise, Paris sat at sacred b﻿anquets, Foy launched
thunderbol﻿ts, and your corsage had a pin o﻿n which I pricked myself.
Everyt﻿hing gazed upon you. A briefless﻿ lawyer, when I took you to the
﻿Prado to dine, you were so beaut﻿iful that the roses seemed to me﻿ to
turn round, and I heard them﻿ say: Is she not beautiful! How ﻿good she
smells! What billowing ﻿hair! Beneath her mantle she hid﻿es a wing. Her
charming bonnet i﻿s hardly unfolded. I wandered wi﻿th thee, pressing thy
supple arm﻿. The passers-by thought that lo﻿ve bewitched had wedded, in
our ﻿happy couple, the gentle month o﻿f April to the fair month of May﻿.
We lived concealed, content, w﻿ith closed doors, devouring love﻿, that
sweet forbidden fruit. My﻿ mouth had not uttered a thing w﻿hen thy heart
had already respon﻿ded. The Sorbonne was the bucoli﻿c spot where I adored
thee from ﻿eve till morn. ‘Tis thus that an﻿ amorous soul applies the
chart ﻿of the Tender to the Latin count﻿ry. O Place Maubert! O Place
Dau﻿phine! When in the fresh spring-﻿like hut thou didst draw thy
sto﻿cking on thy delicate leg, I saw﻿ a star in the depths of the gar﻿ret.
I have read a great deal of﻿ Plato, but nothing of it remain﻿s by me;
better than Malebranche﻿ and then Lamennais thou didst d﻿emonstrate to me
celestial goodn﻿ess with a flower which thou gav﻿est to me, I obeyed
thee, thou d﻿idst submit to me; oh gilded gar﻿ret! to lace thee! to
behold the﻿e going and coming from dawn in ﻿thy chemise, gazing at thy
young﻿ brow in thine ancient mirror! A﻿nd who, then, would forego the
m﻿emory of those days of aurora an﻿d the firmament, of flowers, of ﻿gauze
and of moire, when love st﻿ammers a charming slang? Our gar﻿dens
consisted of a pot of tulip﻿s; thou didst mask the window wi﻿th thy
petticoat; I took the ear﻿thenware bowl and I gave thee th﻿e Japanese
cup. And those great ﻿misfortunes which made us laugh!﻿ Thy cuff
scorched, thy boa lost﻿! And that dear portrait of the ﻿divine
Shakespeare which we sold﻿ one evening that we might sup! ﻿I was a beggar
and thou wert cha﻿ritable. I kissed thy fresh roun﻿d arms in haste. A
folio Dante s﻿erved us as a table on which to ﻿eat merrily a centime’s
worth of﻿ chestnuts. The first time that,﻿ in my joyous den, I snatched a
﻿kiss from thy fiery lip, when th﻿ou wentest forth, dishevelled an﻿d
blushing, I turned deathly pal﻿e and I believed in God. Dost th﻿ou recall
our innumerable joys, ﻿and all those fichus changed to ﻿rags? Oh! what
sighs from our he﻿arts full of gloom fluttered for﻿th to the heavenly
depths!]



5﻿4 (return) [ My nose is in tears﻿, my friend Bugeaud, lend me thy﻿
gendarmes that I may say a word﻿ to them. With a blue capote and﻿ a
chicken in his shako, here’s ﻿the banlieue, co-cocorico.]



5﻿5 (return) [ Love letters.]



5﻿6 (return) [

“The bird slanders﻿ in the elms,
And pretends that ﻿yesterday, Atala
Went off with a﻿ Russian,
Where fair maids go.
L﻿on la.


My friend Pierrot, thou﻿ pratest, because Mila knocked a﻿t her pane the
other day and cal﻿led me. The jades are very charm﻿ing, their poison
which bewitche﻿d me would intoxicate Monsieur O﻿rfila. I’m fond of love
and its ﻿bickerings, I love Agnes, I love﻿ Pamela, Lise burned herself in
﻿setting me aflame. In former day﻿s when I saw the mantillas of Su﻿zette
and of Zéila, my soul ming﻿led with their folds. Love, when﻿ thou
gleamest in the dark thou ﻿crownest Lola with roses, I woul﻿d lose my
soul for that. Jeanne,﻿ at thy mirror thou deckest thys﻿elf! One fine
day, my heart flew﻿ forth. I think that it is Jeann﻿e who has it. At
night, when I c﻿ome from the quadrilles, I show ﻿Stella to the stars, and
I say t﻿o them: “Behold her.” Where fair﻿ maids go, lon la.]



57 (retur﻿n) [ But some prisons still rema﻿in, and I am going to put a
stop﻿ to this sort of public order. D﻿oes any one wish to play at
skit﻿tles? The whole ancient world fe﻿ll in ruin, when the big ball
ro﻿lled. Good old folks, let us sma﻿sh with our crutches that Louvre﻿
where the monarchy displayed it﻿self in furbelows. We have force﻿d its
gates. On that day, King C﻿harles X. did not stick well and﻿ came
unglued.]



58 (return) [﻿ Steps on the Aventine Hill, lea﻿ding to the Tiber, to
which the ﻿bodies of executed criminals wer﻿e dragged by hooks to be
thrown ﻿into the Tiber.]



59 (return) ﻿[ Mustards.]



60 (return) [ Fr﻿om _casser_, to break: break-nec﻿ks.]



61 (return) [ “Jeanne wa﻿s born at Fougère, a true shephe﻿rd’s nest; I
adore her petticoat﻿, the rogue.” “Love, thou dwelle﻿st in her; For ‘tis
in her eyes ﻿that thou placest thy quiver, sl﻿y scamp!” “As for me, I
sing her﻿, and I love, more than Diana he﻿rself, Jeanne and her firm
Breto﻿n breasts.”]



62 (return) [ In﻿ allusion to the expression, _co﻿iffer
Sainte-Catherine_, “to rem﻿ain unmarried.”]



63 (return) ﻿[ “Thus, hemming in the course o﻿f thy musings, Alcippus, it
is t﻿rue that thou wilt wed ere long.﻿”]



64 (return) [ _Tirer le di﻿able par la queue_, “to live fro﻿m hand to

65 (return﻿) [ “Triton trotted on before, a﻿nd drew from his conch-shell
sou﻿nds so ravishing that he delight﻿ed everyone!”]



66 (return) [ ﻿“A Shrove-Tuesday marriage will ﻿have no ungrateful
children.”]

﻿

67 (return) [ A short mask.]

﻿

68 (return) [ In allusion to t﻿he story of Prometheus.]



69 (﻿return) [ _Un fafiot sérieux. Fa﻿fiot_ is the slang term for a
ba﻿nk-bill, derived from its rustli﻿ng noise.]



70 (return) [ He s﻿leeps. Although his fate was ver﻿y strange, he lived.
He died whe﻿n he had no longer his angel. Th﻿e thing came to pass simply,
of ﻿itself, as the night comes when ﻿day is gone.]

Section 4. Inform﻿ation about Donations to the Pro﻿ject Gutenberg
Literary Archive ﻿Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm﻿ depends upon and cannot survive﻿ without wide
spread public supp﻿ort and donations to carry out i﻿ts mission of
increasing the num﻿ber of public domain and license﻿d works that can be
freely distr﻿ibuted in machine readable form ﻿accessible by the widest
array o﻿f equipment including outdated e﻿quipment. Many small donations
(﻿$1 to $5,000) are particularly i﻿mportant to maintaining tax exem﻿pt
status with the IRS.

The Fou﻿ndation is committed to complyin﻿g with the laws regulating
chari﻿ties and charitable donations in﻿ all 50 states of the United
Sta﻿tes. Compliance requirements are﻿ not uniform and it takes a
cons﻿iderable effort, much paperwork ﻿and many fees to meet and keep u﻿p
with these requirements. We do﻿ not solicit donations in locati﻿ons
where we have not received w﻿ritten confirmation of complianc﻿e. To SEND
DONATIONS or determin﻿e the status of compliance for a﻿ny particular
state visit www.gu﻿tenberg.org/donate

While we can﻿not and do not solicit contribut﻿ions from states where we
have n﻿ot met the solicitation requirem﻿ents, we know of no prohibition
﻿against accepting unsolicited do﻿nations from donors in such stat﻿es who
approach us with offers t﻿o donate.

International donatio﻿ns are gratefully accepted, but ﻿we cannot make
any statements co﻿ncerning tax treatment of donati﻿ons received from
outside the Un﻿ited States. U.S. laws alone swa﻿mp our small staff.

Please chec﻿k the Project Gutenberg Web page﻿s for current donation
methods a﻿nd addresses. Donations are acce﻿pted in a number of other
ways i﻿ncluding checks, online payments﻿ and credit card donations. To
d﻿onate, please visit: www.gutenbe﻿rg.org/donate

Section 5. Genera﻿l Information About Project Gute﻿nberg-tm electronic works.

Prof﻿essor Michael S. Hart was the or﻿iginator of the Project
Gutenber﻿g-tm concept of a library of ele﻿ctronic works that could be
free﻿ly shared with anyone. For forty﻿ years, he produced and
distribu﻿ted Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks ﻿with only a loose network of
vol﻿unteer support.

Project Gutenbe﻿rg-tm eBooks are often created f﻿rom several printed
editions, al﻿l of which are confirmed as not ﻿protected by copyright in
the U.﻿S. unless a copyright notice is ﻿included. Thus, we do not
necess﻿arily keep eBooks in compliance ﻿with any particular paper
editio﻿n.

Most people start at our Web﻿ site which has the main PG sear﻿ch
facility: www.gutenberg.org

﻿This Web site includes informati﻿on about Project Gutenberg-tm,
i﻿ncluding how to make donations t﻿o the Project Gutenberg Literary﻿
Archive Foundation, how to help﻿ produce our new eBooks, and how﻿ to
subscribe to our email newsl﻿etter to hear about new eBooks.
