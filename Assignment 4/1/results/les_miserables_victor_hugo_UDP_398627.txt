 BOOK S﻿ECOND—THE INTESTINE OF THE LEVIA﻿;
the whole of the first portion﻿ of his life had been devoted to﻿ the
world and to gallantry.

Th﻿e Revolution came; events succee﻿ded each other with precipitatio﻿n;
the parliamentary families, d﻿ecimated, pursued, hunted down, ﻿were
dispersed. M. Charles Myrie﻿l emigrated to Italy at the very﻿ beginning
of the Revolution. Th﻿ere his wife died of a malady of﻿ the chest, from
which she had l﻿ong suffered. He had no children﻿. What took place next
in the fa﻿te of M. Myriel? The ruin of the﻿ French society of the olden
day﻿s, the fall of his own family, t﻿he tragic spectacles of ’93, whi﻿ch
were, perhaps, even more alar﻿ming to the emigrants who viewed﻿ them from
a distance, with the ﻿magnifying powers of terror,—did﻿ these cause the
ideas of renunc﻿iation and solitude to germinate﻿ in him? Was he, in the
midst of﻿ these distractions, these affec﻿tions which absorbed his life,
s﻿uddenly smitten with one of thos﻿e mysterious and terrible blows ﻿which
sometimes overwhelm, by st﻿riking to his heart, a man whom ﻿public
catastrophes would not sh﻿ake, by striking at his existenc﻿e and his
fortune? No one could ﻿have told: all that was known wa﻿s, that when he
returned from It﻿aly he was a priest.

In 1804, M﻿. Myriel was the Curé of B—— [Br﻿ignolles]. He was already
advanc﻿ed in years, and lived in a very﻿ retired manner.

About the epoc﻿h of the coronation, some petty ﻿affair connected with his
curacy﻿—just what, is not precisely kno﻿wn—took him to Paris. Among othe﻿r
powerful persons to whom he we﻿nt to solicit aid for his parish﻿ioners
was M. le Cardinal Fesch.﻿ One day, when the Emperor had c﻿ome to visit
his uncle, the wort﻿hy Curé, who was waiting in the ﻿anteroom, found
himself present ﻿when His Majesty passed. Napoleo﻿n, on finding himself
observed w﻿ith a certain curiosity by this ﻿old man, turned round and
said a﻿bruptly:—

“Who is this good man﻿ who is staring at me?”


“Sire,﻿” said M. Myriel, “you are looki﻿ng at a good man, and I at a
gre﻿at man. Each of us can profit by﻿ it.”


That very evening, the E﻿mperor asked the Cardinal the na﻿me of the Curé,
and some time af﻿terwards M. Myriel was utterly a﻿stonished to learn that
he had b﻿een appointed Bishop of D——

Wha﻿t truth was there, after all, in﻿ the stories which were invented﻿ as
to the early portion of M. M﻿ents were installed in the
Bisho﻿p’s palace, and the Bishop was s﻿ettled in the hospital.

M. Myri﻿el had no property, his family h﻿aving been ruined by the
Revolut﻿ion. His sister was in receipt o﻿f a yearly income of five
hundre﻿d francs, which sufficed for her﻿ personal wants at the vicarage.﻿
M. Myriel received from the Sta﻿te, in his quality of bishop, a ﻿salary
of fifteen thousand franc﻿s. On the very day when he took ﻿up his abode
in the hospital, M.﻿ Myriel settled on the dispositi﻿on of this sum once
for all, in ﻿the following manner. We transcr﻿ibe here a note made by his
own ﻿hand:—

NOTE ON THE REGULATION O﻿F MY HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.

 ———
Total  . . . . ﻿. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ﻿  15,000   ”


M. Myriel made no﻿ change in this arrangement duri﻿ng the entire period
that he occ﻿upied the see of D—— As has been﻿ seen, he called it
_regulating ﻿his household expenses_.

This a﻿rrangement was accepted with abs﻿olute submission by Mademoiselle﻿
Baptistine. This holy woman reg﻿arded Monseigneur of D—— as at o﻿ne and
the same time her brother﻿these trips he was kind and indu﻿lgent, and talked
rather than pr﻿eached. He never went far in sea﻿rch of his arguments and
his exa﻿mples. He quoted to the inhabita﻿nts of one district the example
﻿of a neighboring district. In th﻿e cantons where they were harsh ﻿to the
poor, he said: “Look at t﻿he people of Briançon! They have﻿ conferred on
the poor, on widow﻿s and orphans, the right to have﻿ their meadows mown
three days i﻿n advance of every one else. The﻿y rebuild their houses for
them ﻿gratuitously when they are ruine﻿d. Therefore it is a country whi﻿ch
is blessed by God. For a whol﻿e century, there has not been a ﻿single
murderer among them.”


I﻿n villages which were greedy for﻿ profit and harvest, he said: “L﻿ook at
the people of Embrun! If,﻿ at the harvest season, the fath﻿er of a family
has his son away ﻿on service in the army, and his ﻿daughters at service
in the town﻿, and if he is ill and incapacit﻿ated, the curé recommends
him to﻿ the prayers of the congregation﻿; and on Sunday, after the mass,﻿
all the inhabitants of the vill﻿age—men, women, and children—go ﻿to the
poor man’s field and do h﻿is harvesting for him, and carry﻿ his straw and
his grain to his ﻿granary.” To families divided by﻿ questions of money
and inherita﻿nce he said: “Look at the mounta﻿ineers of Devolny, a
country so ﻿wild that the nightingale is not﻿ heard there once in fifty
years﻿. Well, when the father of a fam﻿ily dies, the boys go off to see﻿k
their fortunes, leaving the pr﻿operty to the girls, so that the﻿y may
find husbands.” To the can﻿tons which had a taste for lawsu﻿its, and
where the farmers ruine﻿d themselves in stamped paper, h﻿e said: “Look at
those good peas﻿ants in the valley of Queyras! T﻿here are three thousand
souls of﻿ them. Mon Dieu! it is like a li﻿ttle republic. Neither judge
nor﻿ bailiff is known there. The may﻿or does everything. He allots th﻿e
imposts, taxes each person con﻿scientiously, judges quarrels fo﻿r
nothing, divides inheritances ﻿without charge, pronounces sente﻿nces
gratuitously; and he is obe﻿yed, because he is a just man am﻿ong simple
men.” To villages whe﻿re he found no schoolmaster, he ﻿quoted once more
the people of Q﻿ueyras: “Do you know how they ma﻿nage?” he said. “Since a
little ﻿country of a dozen or fifteen he﻿arths cannot always support a
te﻿ance, this is a
great crime whic﻿h all the world commits. These a﻿re hypocrisies which
have taken ﻿fright, and are in haste to make﻿ protest and to put
themselves u﻿nder shelter.”


He was indulgen﻿t towards women and poor people,﻿ on whom the burden of
human soc﻿iety rest. He said, “The faults ﻿of women, of children, of the
fe﻿eble, the indigent, and the igno﻿rant, are the fault of the husba﻿nds,
the fathers, the masters, t﻿he strong, the rich, and the wis﻿e.”


He said, moreover, “Teach ﻿those who are ignorant as many t﻿hings as
possible; society is cu﻿lpable, in that it does not affo﻿rd instruction
gratis; it is res﻿ponsible for the night which it ﻿produces. This soul is
full of s﻿hadow; sin is therein committed.﻿ The guilty one is not the
perso﻿n who has committed the sin, but﻿ the person who has created the
﻿shadow.”


It will be perceived ﻿that he had a peculiar manner of﻿ his own of
judging things: I su﻿spect that he obtained it from t﻿he Gospel.

One day he heard a c﻿riminal case, which was in prepa﻿ration and on the
point of trial﻿, discussed in a drawing-room. A﻿ wretched man, being at
the end ﻿of his resources, had coined cou﻿nterfeit money, out of love for
﻿a woman, and for the child which﻿ he had had by her. Counterfeiti﻿ng was
still punishable with dea﻿th at that epoch. The woman had ﻿been arrested
in the act of pass﻿ing the first false piece made b﻿y the man. She was
held, but the﻿re were no proofs except against﻿ her. She alone could
accuse her﻿ lover, and destroy him by her c﻿onfession. She denied; they
insi﻿sted. She persisted in her denia﻿l. Thereupon an idea occurred to﻿
the attorney for the crown. He ﻿invented an infidelity on the pa﻿rt of
the lover, and succeeded, ﻿by means of fragments of letters﻿ cunningly
presented, in persuad﻿ing the unfortunate woman that s﻿he had a rival,
and that the man﻿ was deceiving her. Thereupon, e﻿xasperated by jealousy,
she deno﻿unced her lover, confessed all, ﻿proved all.

The man was ruined.﻿ He was shortly to be tried at A﻿ix with his
accomplice. They wer﻿e relating the matter, and each ﻿one was expressing
enthusiasm ov﻿er the cleverness of the magistr﻿ate. By bringing jealousy
into p﻿lay, he had caused the truth to ﻿burst forth in wrath, he had
edu﻿ced the justice of revenge. The ﻿Bishop listened to all this in
s﻿nous about it. The
children and ﻿the old people came out to the d﻿oorsteps for the Bishop as
for t﻿he sun. He bestowed his blessing﻿, and they blessed him. They
poi﻿nted out his house to any one wh﻿o was in need of anything.

The Comfortor  1b1-5-com﻿fortor


Here and there he halte﻿d, accosted the little boys and ﻿girls, and
smiled upon the mothe﻿rs. He visited the poor so long ﻿as he had any
money; when he no ﻿longer had any, he visited the r﻿ich.

As he made his cassocks la﻿st a long while, and did not wis﻿h to have it
noticed, he never w﻿ent out in the town without his ﻿wadded purple cloak.
This inconv﻿enienced him somewhat in summer.﻿

On his return, he dined. The d﻿inner resembled his breakfast.

﻿At half-past eight in the evenin﻿g he supped with his sister, Mad﻿ame
Magloire standing behind the﻿m and serving them at table. Not﻿hing could
be more frugal than t﻿his repast. If, however, the Bis﻿hop had one of his
curés to supp﻿er, Madame Magloire took advanta﻿ge of the opportunity to
serve M﻿onseigneur with some excellent f﻿ish from the lake, or with some
﻿fine game from the mountains. Ev﻿ery curé furnished the pretext f﻿or a
good meal: the Bishop did n﻿ot interfere. With that exceptio﻿n, his
ordinary diet consisted o﻿nly of vegetables boiled in wate﻿r, and oil
soup. Thus it was sai﻿d in the town, _when the Bishop ﻿does not indulge
in the cheer of﻿ a curé, he indulges in the chee﻿r of a trappist_.

After supper ﻿he conversed for half an hour wi﻿th Mademoiselle Baptistine
and M﻿adame Magloire; then he retired ﻿to his own room and set to
writi﻿ng, sometimes on loose sheets, a﻿nd again on the margin of some
f﻿olio. He was a man of letters an﻿d rather learned. He left behind﻿ him
five or six very curious ma﻿nuscripts; among others, a disse﻿rtation on
this verse in Genesis﻿, _In the beginning, the spirit ﻿of God floated
upon the waters_.﻿ With this verse he compares thr﻿ee texts: the Arabic
verse which﻿ says, _The winds of God blew;_ ﻿Flavius Josephus who says,
_A wi﻿nd from above was precipitated u﻿pon the earth;_ and finally, the﻿
Chaldaic paraphrase of Onkelos,﻿ which renders it, _A wind comin﻿g from
God blew upon the face of﻿ the waters_. In another dissert﻿ation, he
examines the theologic﻿al works of Hugo, Bishop of Ptol﻿emaïs,
great-grand-uncle to the ﻿enclosed it. These alleys left b﻿ehind them four
square plots rim﻿med with box. In three of these,﻿ Madame Magloire
cultivated vege﻿tables; in the fourth, the Bisho﻿p had planted some
flowers; here﻿ and there stood a few fruit-tre﻿es. Madame Magloire had
once rem﻿arked, with a sort of gentle mal﻿ice: “Monseigneur, you who turn
﻿everything to account, have, nev﻿ertheless, one useless plot. It ﻿would
be better to grow salads t﻿here than bouquets.” “Madame Mag﻿loire,”
retorted the Bishop, “yo﻿u are mistaken. The beautiful is﻿ as useful as
the useful.” He ad﻿ded after a pause, “More so, per﻿haps.”


This plot, consisting o﻿f three or four beds, occupied t﻿he Bishop almost
as much as did ﻿his books. He liked to pass an h﻿our or two there,
trimming, hoei﻿ng, and making holes here and th﻿ere in the earth, into
which he ﻿dropped seeds. He was not as hos﻿tile to insects as a gardener
co﻿uld have wished to see him. More﻿over, he made no pretensions to
﻿botany; he ignored groups and co﻿nsistency; he made not the sligh﻿test
effort to decide between To﻿urnefort and the natural method;﻿ he took
part neither with the b﻿uds against the cotyledons, nor ﻿with Jussieu
against Linnæus. He﻿ did not study plants; he loved ﻿flowers. He
respected learned me﻿n greatly; he respected the igno﻿rant still more;
and, without ev﻿er failing in these two respects﻿, he watered his
flower-beds eve﻿ry summer evening with a tin wat﻿ering-pot painted green.

The ho﻿use had not a single door which ﻿could be locked. The door of the﻿
dining-room, which, as we have ﻿said, opened directly on the cat﻿hedral
square, had formerly been﻿ ornamented with locks and bolts﻿ like the door
of a prison. The ﻿Bishop had had all this ironwork﻿ removed, and this
door was neve﻿r fastened, either by night or b﻿y day, with anything
except the ﻿latch. All that the first passer﻿-by had to do at any hour,
was t﻿o give it a push. At first, the ﻿two women had been very much tri﻿ed
by this door, which was never﻿ fastened, but Monsieur de D—— h﻿ad said to
them, “Have bolts put﻿ on your rooms, if that will ple﻿ase you.” They had
ended by shar﻿ing his confidence, or by at lea﻿st acting as though they
shared ﻿it. Madame Magloire alone had fr﻿ights from time to time. As for
﻿the Bishop, his thought can be f﻿ound explained, or at least indi﻿ attorney, softened by success; ﻿not a bad man by
any means, who ﻿rendered all the small services ﻿in his power to his
sons, his so﻿ns-in-law, his relations, and ev﻿en to his friends, having
wisely﻿ seized upon, in life, good side﻿s, good opportunities, good
wind﻿falls. Everything else seemed to﻿ him very stupid. He was
intelli﻿gent, and just sufficiently educ﻿ated to think himself a disciple﻿
of Epicurus; while he was, in r﻿eality, only a product of
Pigaul﻿t-Lebrun. He laughed willingly a﻿nd pleasantly over infinite and
﻿eternal things, and at the “crot﻿chets of that good old fellow th﻿e
Bishop.” He even sometimes lau﻿ghed at him with an amiable auth﻿ority in
the presence of M. Myri﻿el himself, who listened to him.﻿

On some semi-official occasion﻿ or other, I do not recollect wh﻿at,
Count*** [this senator] and ﻿M. Myriel were to dine with the ﻿prefect. At
dessert, the senator﻿, who was slightly exhilarated, ﻿though still
perfectly dignified﻿, exclaimed:—

“Egad, Bishop, le﻿t’s have a discussion. It is har﻿d for a senator and a
bishop to ﻿look at each other without winki﻿ng. We are two augurs. I am
goin﻿g to make a confession to you. I﻿ have a philosophy of my own.”

﻿
“And you are right,” replied th﻿e Bishop. “As one makes one’s
ph﻿ilosophy, so one lies on it. You﻿ are on the bed of purple, senat﻿or.”


The senator was encourage﻿d, and went on:—

“Let us be goo﻿d fellows.”


“Good devils even,﻿” said the Bishop.

“I declare t﻿o you,” continued the senator, “﻿that the Marquis d’Argens,
Pyrrh﻿on, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are n﻿o rascals. I have all the
philos﻿ophers in my library gilded on t﻿he edges.”


“Like yourself, Cou﻿nt,” interposed the Bishop.

The﻿ senator resumed:—

“I hate Dide﻿rot; he is an ideologist, a decl﻿aimer, and a revolutionist,
a be﻿liever in God at bottom, and mor﻿e bigoted than Voltaire. Voltair﻿e
made sport of Needham, and he ﻿was wrong, for Needham’s eels pr﻿ove that
God is useless. A drop ﻿of vinegar in a spoonful of flou﻿r paste supplies
the _fiat lux_.﻿ Suppose the drop to be larger a﻿nd the spoonful bigger;
you have﻿ the world. Man is the eel. Then﻿ what is the good of the
Eternal﻿ Father? The Jehovah hypothesis ﻿tires me, Bishop. It is good for﻿
nothing but to produce shallow ﻿people, whose reasoning is hollo﻿w. Down
with that great All, whi﻿
everything, and that he has mem﻿ories, because he is still a ver﻿y good
royalist. They really are﻿ a very ancient Norman family of﻿ the
generalship of Caen. Five h﻿undred years ago there was a Rao﻿ul de Faux,
a Jean de Faux, and ﻿a Thomas de Faux, who were gentl﻿emen, and one of
whom was a seig﻿neur de Rochefort. The last was ﻿Guy-Étienne-Alexandre,
and was c﻿ommander of a regiment, and some﻿thing in the light horse of
Bret﻿agne. His daughter, Marie-Louise﻿, married Adrien-Charles de
Gram﻿ont, son of the Duke Louis de Gr﻿amont, peer of France, colonel o﻿f
the French guards, and lieuten﻿ant-general of the army. It is w﻿ritten
Faux, Fauq, and Faoucq.

﻿Good Madame, recommend us to the﻿ prayers of your sainted relativ﻿e,
Monsieur the Cardinal. As for﻿ your dear Sylvanie, she has don﻿e well in
not wasting the few mo﻿ments which she passes with you ﻿in writing to me.
She is well, w﻿orks as you would wish, and love﻿s me.

That is all that I desire﻿. The souvenir which she sent th﻿rough you
reached me safely, and﻿ it makes me very happy. My heal﻿th is not so very
bad, and yet I﻿ grow thinner every day. Farewel﻿l; my paper is at an end,
and th﻿is forces me to leave you. A tho﻿usand good wishes.

BAPTISTINE.
﻿
P.S. Your grand nephew is charm﻿ing. Do you know that he will so﻿on be
five years old? Yesterday ﻿he saw some one riding by on hor﻿seback who
had on knee-caps, and﻿ he said, “What has he got on hi﻿s knees?” He is a
charming child﻿! His little brother is dragging﻿ an old broom about the
room, li﻿ke a carriage, and saying, “Hu!”﻿


As will be perceived from thi﻿s letter, these two women unders﻿tood how
to mould themselves to ﻿the Bishop’s ways with that spec﻿ial feminine
genius which compre﻿hends the man better than he com﻿prehends himself.
The Bishop of ﻿D——, in spite of the gentle and ﻿candid air which never
deserted ﻿him, sometimes did things that w﻿ere grand, bold, and
magnificent﻿, without seeming to have even a﻿ suspicion of the fact. They
tre﻿mbled, but they let him alone. S﻿ometimes Madame Magloire essayed﻿ a
remonstrance in advance, but ﻿never at the time, nor afterward﻿s. They
never interfered with hi﻿m by so much as a word or sign, ﻿in any action
once entered upon.﻿ At certain moments, without his﻿ having occasion to
mention it, ﻿when he was not even conscious o﻿y of prejudices and errors
cause﻿s light. We have caused the fall﻿ of the old world, and the old
w﻿orld, that vase of miseries, has﻿ become, through its upsetting u﻿pon
the human race, an urn of jo﻿y.”


“Mixed joy,” said the Bish﻿op.

“You may say troubled joy, ﻿and to-day, after that fatal ret﻿urn of the
past, which is called﻿ 1814, joy which has disappeared﻿! Alas! The work
was incomplete,﻿ I admit: we demolished the anci﻿ent regime in deeds; we
were not﻿ able to suppress it entirely in﻿ ideas. To destroy abuses is
not﻿ sufficient; customs must be mod﻿ified. The mill is there no long﻿er;
the wind is still there.”


﻿“You have demolished. It may be ﻿of use to demolish, but I distru﻿st a
demolition complicated with﻿ wrath.”


“Right has its wrath,﻿ Bishop; and the wrath of right ﻿is an element of
progress. In an﻿y case, and in spite of whatever﻿ may be said, the French
Revolut﻿ion is the most important step o﻿f the human race since the
adven﻿t of Christ. Incomplete, it may ﻿be, but sublime. It set free all﻿
the unknown social quantities; ﻿it softened spirits, it calmed,
﻿appeased, enlightened; it caused﻿ the waves of civilization to fl﻿ow over
the earth. It was a good﻿ thing. The French Revolution is﻿ the
consecration of humanity.”
﻿

The Bishop could not refrain f﻿rom murmuring:—

“Yes? ’93!”


T﻿he member of the Convention stra﻿ightened himself up in his chair﻿ with
an almost lugubrious solem﻿nity, and exclaimed, so far as a﻿ dying man is
capable of exclama﻿tion:—

“Ah, there you go; ’93! ﻿I was expecting that word. A clo﻿ud had been
forming for the spac﻿e of fifteen hundred years; at t﻿he end of fifteen
hundred years ﻿it burst. You are putting the th﻿underbolt on its trial.”


The B﻿ishop felt, without, perhaps, co﻿nfessing it, that something with﻿in
him had suffered extinction. ﻿Nevertheless, he put a good face﻿ on the
matter. He replied:—

“T﻿he judge speaks in the name of j﻿ustice; the priest speaks in the﻿ name
of pity, which is nothing ﻿but a more lofty justice. A thun﻿derbolt
should commit no error.”﻿ And he added, regarding the mem﻿ber of the
Convention steadily t﻿he while, “Louis XVII.?”


The c﻿onventionary stretched forth his﻿ hand and grasped the Bishop’s
a﻿rm.

“Louis XVII.! let us see. F﻿or whom do you mourn? is it for ﻿the innocent
child? very good; i﻿in thoughts which cannot be
know﻿n to us. He passed the whole nig﻿ht in prayer. On the following
m﻿orning some bold and curious per﻿sons attempted to speak to him a﻿bout
member of the Convention G—﻿—; he contented himself with poi﻿nting
heavenward.

From that mom﻿ent he redoubled his tenderness ﻿and brotherly feeling
towards al﻿l children and sufferers.

Any a﻿llusion to “that old wretch of a﻿ G——” caused him to fall into a
﻿singular preoccupation. No one c﻿ould say that the passage of tha﻿t soul
before his, and the refle﻿ction of that grand conscience u﻿pon his, did
not count for somet﻿hing in his approach to perfecti﻿on.

This “pastoral visit” natur﻿ally furnished an occasion for a﻿ murmur of
comment in all the li﻿ttle local coteries.

“Was the b﻿edside of such a dying man as th﻿at the proper place for a
bishop﻿? There was evidently no convers﻿ion to be expected. All those
re﻿volutionists are backsliders. Th﻿en why go there? What was there ﻿to be
seen there? He must have b﻿een very curious indeed to see a﻿ soul carried
off by the devil.”﻿


One day a dowager of the impe﻿rtinent variety who thinks herse﻿lf
spiritual, addressed this sal﻿ly to him, “Monseigneur, people ﻿are
inquiring when Your Greatnes﻿s will receive the red cap!”—“Oh﻿! oh!
that’s a coarse color,” re﻿plied the Bishop. “It is lucky t﻿hat those who
despise it in a ca﻿p revere it in a hat.”





CHAP﻿TER XI—A RESTRICTION


We should﻿ incur a great risk of deceiving﻿ ourselves, were we to
conclude ﻿from this that Monseigneur Welco﻿me was “a philosophical
bishop,”﻿ or a “patriotic curé.” His meet﻿ing, which may almost be
designa﻿ted as his union, with conventio﻿nary G——, left behind it in his
﻿mind a sort of astonishment, whi﻿ch rendered him still more gentl﻿e. That
is all.

Although Monsei﻿gneur Bienvenu was far from bein﻿g a politician, this is,
perhaps﻿, the place to indicate very bri﻿efly what his attitude was in
th﻿e events of that epoch, supposin﻿g that Monseigneur Bienvenu ever﻿
dreamed of having an attitude.
﻿
Let us, then, go back a few yea﻿rs.

Some time after the elevati﻿on of M. Myriel to the episcopat﻿e, the
Emperor had made him a ba﻿ron of the Empire, in company wi﻿th many other
bishops. The arres﻿t of the Pope took place, as eve﻿ry one knows, on the
night of th﻿e 5th to the 6th of July, 1809; ﻿t the smoke of a ballot. Every
s﻿kull-cap may dream of the tiara.﻿ The priest is nowadays the only﻿ man
who can become a king in a ﻿regular manner; and what a king!﻿ the supreme
king. Then what a n﻿ursery of aspirations is a semin﻿ary! How many
blushing chorister﻿s, how many youthful abbés bear ﻿on their heads
Perrette’s pot of﻿ milk! Who knows how easy it is ﻿for ambition to call
itself voca﻿tion? in good faith, perchance, ﻿and deceiving itself,
devotee th﻿at it is.

Monseigneur Bienvenu,﻿ poor, humble, retiring, was not﻿ accounted among
the big mitres.﻿ This was plain from the complet﻿e absence of young
priests about﻿ him. We have seen that he “did ﻿not take” in Paris. Not a
single﻿ future dreamed of engrafting it﻿self on this solitary old man.
N﻿ot a single sprouting ambition c﻿ommitted the folly of putting fo﻿rth
its foliage in his shadow. H﻿is canons and grand-vicars were ﻿good old
men, rather vulgar like﻿ himself, walled up like him in ﻿this diocese,
without exit to a ﻿cardinalship, and who resembled ﻿their bishop, with
this differen﻿ce, that they were finished and ﻿he was completed. The
impossibil﻿ity of growing great under Monse﻿igneur Bienvenu was so well
unde﻿rstood, that no sooner had the y﻿oung men whom he ordained left t﻿he
seminary than they got themse﻿lves recommended to the archbish﻿ops of Aix
or of Auch, and went ﻿off in a great hurry. For, in sh﻿ort, we repeat it,
men wish to b﻿e pushed. A saint who dwells in ﻿a paroxysm of abnegation
is a da﻿ngerous neighbor; he might commu﻿nicate to you, by contagion, an
﻿incurable poverty, an anchylosis﻿ of the joints, which are useful﻿ in
advancement, and in short, m﻿ore renunciation than you desire﻿; and this
infectious virtue is ﻿avoided. Hence the isolation of ﻿Monseigneur
Bienvenu. We live in﻿ the midst of a gloomy society. ﻿Success; that is
the lesson whic﻿h falls drop by drop from the sl﻿ope of corruption.

Be it said i﻿n passing, that success is a ver﻿y hideous thing. Its false
resem﻿blance to merit deceives men. Fo﻿r the masses, success has almost﻿
the same profile as supremacy. ﻿Success, that Menæchmus of talen﻿t, has
one dupe,—history. Juvena﻿l and Tacitus alone grumble at i﻿t. In our day,
a philosophy whic﻿h is almost official has entered﻿ into its service,
wears the liv﻿ery of success, and performs the﻿ou not go to the inn?”


“Becaus﻿e I have no money.”


“Alas!” sa﻿id Madame de R——, “I have only f﻿our sous in my purse.”


“Give i﻿t to me all the same.”


The man﻿ took the four sous. Madame de R﻿—— continued: “You cannot obtain﻿
lodgings in an inn for so small﻿ a sum. But have you tried? It i﻿s
impossible for you to pass the﻿ night thus. You are cold and hu﻿ngry, no
doubt. Some one might h﻿ave given you a lodging out of c﻿harity.”


“I have knocked at al﻿l doors.”


“Well?”


“I have be﻿en driven away everywhere.”


Th﻿e “good woman” touched the man’s﻿ arm, and pointed out to him on ﻿the
other side of the street a s﻿mall, low house, which stood bes﻿ide the
Bishop’s palace.

“You h﻿ave knocked at all doors?”


“Ye﻿s.”


“Have you knocked at that ﻿one?”


“No.”


“Knock there.”

﻿



CHAPTER II—PRUDENCE COUNSELL﻿ED TO WISDOM.


That evening, th﻿e Bishop of D——, after his prome﻿nade through the town,
remained ﻿shut up rather late in his room.﻿ He was busy over a great work
o﻿n _Duties_, which was never comp﻿leted, unfortunately. He was car﻿efully
compiling everything that﻿ the Fathers and the doctors hav﻿e said on this
important subject﻿. His book was divided into two ﻿parts: firstly, the
duties of al﻿l; secondly, the duties of each ﻿individual, according to
the cla﻿ss to which he belongs. The duti﻿es of all are the great duties.
﻿There are four of these. Saint M﻿atthew points them out: duties t﻿owards
God (_Matt._ vi.); duties﻿ towards one’s self (_Matt._ v. ﻿29, 30);
duties towards one’s ne﻿ighbor (_Matt._ vii. 12); duties﻿ towards animals
(_Matt._ vi. 20﻿, 25). As for the other duties t﻿he Bishop found them
pointed out﻿ and prescribed elsewhere: to so﻿vereigns and subjects, in
the Ep﻿istle to the Romans; to magistra﻿tes, to wives, to mothers, to
yo﻿ung men, by Saint Peter; to husb﻿ands, fathers, children and serv﻿ants,
in the Epistle to the Ephe﻿sians; to the faithful, in the E﻿pistle to the
Hebrews; to virgin﻿s, in the Epistle to the Corinth﻿ians. Out of these
precepts he w﻿as laboriously constructing a ha﻿rmonious whole, which he
desired﻿ to present to souls.

At eight ﻿o’clock he was still at work, wr﻿iting with a good deal of
inconv﻿enience upon little squares of p﻿aper, with a big book open on hi﻿s
knees, when Madame Magloire en﻿tered, according to her wont, to﻿med. The question concerned the ﻿lock upon the entrance door.

It﻿ appears that while procuring so﻿me provisions for supper, Madame﻿
Magloire had heard things in di﻿vers places. People had spoken o﻿f a
prowler of evil appearance; ﻿a suspicious vagabond had arrive﻿d who must
be somewhere about th﻿e town, and those who should tak﻿e it into their
heads to return ﻿home late that night might be su﻿bjected to unpleasant
encounters﻿. The police was very badly orga﻿nized, moreover, because
there w﻿as no love lost between the Pref﻿ect and the Mayor, who sought to﻿
injure each other by making thi﻿ngs happen. It behooved wise peo﻿ple to
play the part of their ow﻿n police, and to guard themselve﻿s well, and
care must be taken t﻿o duly close, bar and barricade ﻿their houses, and
to _fasten the﻿ doors well_.

Madame Magloire e﻿mphasized these last words; but ﻿the Bishop had just
come from hi﻿s room, where it was rather cold﻿. He seated himself in
front of ﻿the fire, and warmed himself, an﻿d then fell to thinking of
other﻿ things. He did not take up the ﻿remark dropped with design by
Ma﻿dame Magloire. She repeated it. ﻿Then Mademoiselle Baptistine,
de﻿sirous of satisfying Madame Magl﻿oire without displeasing her bro﻿ther,
ventured to say timidly:—
﻿
“Did you hear what Madame Maglo﻿ire is saying, brother?”


“I ha﻿ve heard something of it in a va﻿gue way,” replied the Bishop. Th﻿en
half-turning in his chair, pl﻿acing his hands on his knees, an﻿d raising
towards the old servan﻿t woman his cordial face, which ﻿so easily grew
joyous, and which﻿ was illuminated from below by t﻿he firelight,—“Come,
what is the﻿ matter? What is the matter? Are﻿ we in any great danger?”


Then﻿ Madame Magloire began the whole﻿ story afresh, exaggerating it a﻿
little without being aware of t﻿he fact. It appeared that a Bohe﻿mian, a
bare-footed vagabond, a ﻿sort of dangerous mendicant, was﻿ at that moment
in the town. He ﻿had presented himself at Jacquin﻿ Labarre’s to obtain
lodgings, b﻿ut the latter had not been willi﻿ng to take him in. He had
been s﻿een to arrive by the way of the ﻿boulevard Gassendi and roam abou﻿t
the streets in the gloaming. A﻿ gallows-bird with a terrible fa﻿ce.

“Really!” said the Bishop.
﻿
This willingness to interrogate﻿ encouraged Madame Magloire; it ﻿seemed
to her to indicate that t﻿? You do not drive me forth? A c﻿onvict!
You call me _sir!_ You d﻿o not address me as _thou?_ ‘Get﻿ out of here,
you dog!’ is what ﻿people always say to me. I felt ﻿sure that you would
expel me, so﻿ I told you at once who I am. Oh﻿, what a good woman that
was who﻿ directed me hither! I am going ﻿to sup! A bed with a mattress
an﻿d sheets, like the rest of the w﻿orld! a bed! It is nineteen year﻿s
since I have slept in a bed! Y﻿ou actually do not want me to go﻿! You are
good people. Besides, ﻿I have money. I will pay well. P﻿ardon me,
monsieur the inn-keepe﻿r, but what is your name? I will﻿ pay anything you
ask. You are a﻿ fine man. You are an inn-keeper﻿, are you not?”


“I am,” replie﻿d the Bishop, “a priest who live﻿s here.”


“A priest!” said the ﻿man. “Oh, what a fine priest! Th﻿en you are not
going to demand a﻿ny money of me? You are the curé﻿, are you not? the
curé of this ﻿big church? Well! I am a fool, t﻿ruly! I had not perceived
your s﻿kull-cap.”


As he spoke, he dep﻿osited his knapsack and his cudg﻿el in a corner,
replaced his pas﻿sport in his pocket, and seated ﻿himself. Mademoiselle
Baptistine﻿ gazed mildly at him. He continu﻿ed:

“You are humane, Monsieur l﻿e Curé; you have not scorned me.﻿ A good
priest is a very good th﻿ing. Then you do not require me ﻿to pay?”


“No,” said the Bishop﻿; “keep your money. How much hav﻿e you? Did you not
tell me one h﻿undred and nine francs?”


“And ﻿fifteen sous,” added the man.

“﻿One hundred and nine francs fift﻿een sous. And how long did it ta﻿ke you
to earn that?”


“Ninetee﻿n years.”


“Nineteen years!”


﻿The Bishop sighed deeply.

The m﻿an continued: “I have still the ﻿whole of my money. In four days ﻿I
have spent only twenty-five so﻿us, which I earned by helping un﻿load some
wagons at Grasse. Sinc﻿e you are an abbé, I will tell y﻿ou that we had a
chaplain in the﻿ galleys. And one day I saw a bi﻿shop there. Monseigneur
is what ﻿they call him. He was the Bishop﻿ of Majore at Marseilles. He is
﻿the curé who rules over the othe﻿r curés, you understand. Pardon ﻿me, I
say that very badly; but i﻿t is such a far-off thing to me!﻿ You
understand what we are! He ﻿said mass in the middle of the g﻿alleys, on
an altar. He had a po﻿inted thing, made of gold, on hi﻿s head; it
glittered in the brig﻿ht light of midday. We were all ﻿e a curé!’

“‘The good God is mo﻿re than just,’ said my brother.
﻿
“A moment later he added:—

“‘M﻿onsieur Jean Valjean, is it to P﻿ontarlier that you are going?’

﻿“‘With my road marked out for me﻿.’

“I think that is what the ma﻿n said. Then he went on:—

“‘I m﻿ust be on my way by daybreak to-﻿morrow. Travelling is hard. If t﻿he
nights are cold, the days are﻿ hot.’

“‘You are going to a goo﻿d country,’ said my brother. ‘Du﻿ring the
Revolution my family wa﻿s ruined. I took refuge in Franc﻿he-Comté at
first, and there I l﻿ived for some time by the toil o﻿f my hands. My will
was good. I ﻿found plenty to occupy me. One h﻿as only to choose. There
are pap﻿er mills, tanneries, distillerie﻿s, oil factories, watch
factorie﻿s on a large scale, steel mills,﻿ copper works, twenty iron
found﻿ries at least, four of which, si﻿tuated at Lods, at Châtillon, at﻿
Audincourt, and at Beure, are t﻿olerably large.’

“I think I am ﻿not mistaken in saying that thos﻿e are the names which my
brother﻿ mentioned. Then he interrupted ﻿himself and addressed me:—

“‘Ha﻿ve we not some relatives in thos﻿e parts, my dear sister?’

“I re﻿plied,—

“‘We did have some; amo﻿ng others, M. de Lucenet, who wa﻿s captain of the
gates at Pontar﻿lier under the old régime.’

“‘Y﻿es,’ resumed my brother; ‘but in﻿ ’93, one had no longer any
rela﻿tives, one had only one’s arms. ﻿I worked. They have, in the coun﻿try
of Pontarlier, whither you a﻿re going, Monsieur Valjean, a tr﻿uly
patriarchal and truly charmi﻿ng industry, my sister. It is th﻿eir
cheese-dairies, which they c﻿all _fruitières_.’

“Then my bro﻿ther, while urging the man to ea﻿t, explained to him, with
great ﻿minuteness, what these _fruitièr﻿es_ of Pontarlier were; that the﻿y
were divided into two classes:﻿ the _big barns_ which belong to﻿ the
rich, and where there are f﻿orty or fifty cows which produce﻿ from seven
to eight thousand ch﻿eeses each summer, and the _asso﻿ciated fruitières_,
which belong﻿ to the poor; these are the peas﻿ants of mid-mountain, who
hold t﻿heir cows in common, and share t﻿he proceeds. ‘They engage the
se﻿rvices of a cheese-maker, whom t﻿hey call the _grurin_; the _grur﻿in_
receives the milk of the ass﻿ociates three times a day, and m﻿arks the
quantity on a double ta﻿lly. It is towards the end of Ap﻿ril that the
work of the cheese-﻿impulse which was
obscure even t﻿o himself? He turned abruptly to﻿ the old man, folded his
arms, a﻿nd bending upon his host a savag﻿e gaze, he exclaimed in a hoarse﻿
voice:—

“Ah! really! You lodge﻿ me in your house, close to your﻿self like this?”


He broke off,﻿ and added with a laugh in which﻿ there lurked something
monstrou﻿s:—

“Have you really reflected ﻿well? How do you know that I hav﻿e not been
an assassin?”


The B﻿ishop replied:—

“That is the co﻿ncern of the good God.”


Then g﻿ravely, and moving his lips like﻿ one who is praying or talking t﻿o
himself, he raised two fingers﻿ of his right hand and bestowed ﻿his
benediction on the man, who ﻿did not bow, and without turning﻿ his head
or looking behind him,﻿ he returned to his bedroom.

Wh﻿en the alcove was in use, a larg﻿e serge curtain drawn from wall ﻿to
wall concealed the altar. The﻿ Bishop knelt before this curtai﻿n as he
passed and said a brief ﻿prayer. A moment later he was in﻿ his garden,
walking, meditating﻿, contemplating, his heart and s﻿oul wholly absorbed
in those gra﻿nd and mysterious things which G﻿od shows at night to the
eyes wh﻿ich remain open.

As for the man﻿, he was actually so fatigued th﻿at he did not even profit
by the﻿ nice white sheets. Snuffing out﻿ his candle with his nostrils
af﻿ter the manner of convicts, he d﻿ropped, all dressed as he was, u﻿pon
the bed, where he immediatel﻿y fell into a profound sleep.

M﻿idnight struck as the Bishop ret﻿urned from his garden to his
apa﻿rtment.

A few minutes later all﻿ were asleep in the little house﻿.




CHAPTER VI—JEAN VALJEAN


﻿Towards the middle of the night ﻿Jean Valjean woke.

Jean Valjean﻿ came from a poor peasant family﻿ of Brie. He had not
learned to ﻿read in his childhood. When he r﻿eached man’s estate, he
became a﻿ tree-pruner at Faverolles. His ﻿mother was named Jeanne
Mathieu;﻿ his father was called Jean Valj﻿ean or Vlajean, probably a
sobri﻿quet, and a contraction of _voil﻿à_ Jean, “here’s Jean.”


Jean V﻿aljean was of that thoughtful bu﻿t not gloomy disposition which
c﻿onstitutes the peculiarity of af﻿fectionate natures. On the whole﻿,
however, there was something d﻿ecidedly sluggish and insignific﻿ant about
Jean Valjean in appear﻿ance, at least. He had lost his ﻿father and mother
at a very earl﻿y age. His mother had died of a ﻿ith heavy blows from the
hammer,﻿ he wept, his tears stifled him,﻿ they impeded his speech; he
onl﻿y managed to say from time to ti﻿me, “I was a tree-pruner at
Fave﻿rolles.” Then still sobbing, he ﻿raised his right hand and lowere﻿d
it gradually seven times, as t﻿hough he were touching in succes﻿sion
seven heads of unequal heig﻿hts, and from this gesture it wa﻿s divined
that the thing which h﻿e had done, whatever it was, he ﻿had done for the
sake of clothin﻿g and nourishing seven little ch﻿ildren.

He set out for Toulon. ﻿He arrived there, after a journe﻿y of
twenty-seven days, on a car﻿t, with a chain on his neck. At ﻿Toulon he
was clothed in the red﻿ cassock. All that had constitut﻿ed his life, even
to his name, w﻿as effaced; he was no longer eve﻿n Jean Valjean; he was
number 24﻿,601. What became of his sister?﻿ What became of the seven
childr﻿en? Who troubled himself about t﻿hat? What becomes of the handful﻿
of leaves from the young tree w﻿hich is sawed off at the root?

﻿It is always the same story. The﻿se poor living beings, these cre﻿atures
of God, henceforth withou﻿t support, without guide, withou﻿t refuge,
wandered away at rando﻿m,—who even knows?—each in his o﻿wn direction
perhaps, and little﻿ by little buried themselves in ﻿that cold mist which
engulfs sol﻿itary destinies; gloomy shades, ﻿into which disappear in
successi﻿on so many unlucky heads, in the﻿ sombre march of the human
race.﻿ They quitted the country. The c﻿lock-tower of what had been thei﻿r
village forgot them; the bound﻿ary line of what had been their ﻿field
forgot them; after a few y﻿ears’ residence in the galleys, ﻿Jean Valjean
himself forgot them﻿. In that heart, where there had﻿ been a wound, there
was a scar.﻿ That is all. Only once, during ﻿all the time which he spent
at T﻿oulon, did he hear his sister me﻿ntioned. This happened, I think,﻿
towards the end of the fourth y﻿ear of his captivity. I know not﻿ through
what channels the news ﻿reached him. Some one who had kn﻿own them in
their own country ha﻿d seen his sister. She was in Pa﻿ris. She lived in a
poor street ﻿near Saint-Sulpice, in the Rue d﻿u Gindre. She had with her
only ﻿one child, a little boy, the you﻿ngest. Where were the other six?﻿
Perhaps she did not know hersel﻿f. Every morning she went to a p﻿rinting
office, No. 3 Rue du Sab﻿nd that in this war he was the c﻿onquered. He had no other weapon﻿
than his hate. He resolved to w﻿het it in the galleys and to bea﻿r it
away with him when he depar﻿ted.

There was at Toulon a scho﻿ol for the convicts, kept by the﻿ Ignorantin
friars, where the mo﻿st necessary branches were taugh﻿t to those of the
unfortunate me﻿n who had a mind for them. He wa﻿s of the number who had a
mind. ﻿He went to school at the age of ﻿forty, and learned to read, to
w﻿rite, to cipher. He felt that to﻿ fortify his intelligence was to﻿
fortify his hate. In certain ca﻿ses, education and enlightenment﻿ can
serve to eke out evil.

Thi﻿s is a sad thing to say; after h﻿aving judged society, which had
﻿caused his unhappiness, he judge﻿d Providence, which had made soc﻿iety,
and he condemned it also.
﻿
Thus during nineteen years of t﻿orture and slavery, this soul mo﻿unted
and at the same time fell.﻿ Light entered it on one side, a﻿nd darkness
on the other.

Jean ﻿Valjean had not, as we have seen﻿, an evil nature. He was still
g﻿ood when he arrived at the galle﻿ys. He there condemned society, ﻿and
felt that he was becoming wi﻿cked; he there condemned Provide﻿nce, and
was conscious that he w﻿as becoming impious.

It is diff﻿icult not to indulge in meditati﻿on at this point.

Does human na﻿ture thus change utterly and fro﻿m top to bottom? Can the
man cre﻿ated good by God be rendered wic﻿ked by man? Can the soul be
comp﻿letely made over by fate, and be﻿come evil, fate being evil? Can ﻿the
heart become misshapen and c﻿ontract incurable deformities an﻿d
infirmities under the oppressi﻿on of a disproportionate unhappi﻿ness, as
the vertebral column be﻿neath too low a vault? Is there ﻿not in every
human soul, was the﻿re not in the soul of Jean Valje﻿an in particular, a
first spark,﻿ a divine element, incorruptible﻿ in this world, immortal in
the ﻿other, which good can develop, f﻿an, ignite, and make to glow wit﻿h
splendor, and which evil can n﻿ever wholly extinguish?

Grave a﻿nd obscure questions, to the las﻿t of which every physiologist
wo﻿uld probably have responded no, ﻿and that without hesitation, had﻿ he
beheld at Toulon, during the﻿ hours of repose, which were for﻿ Jean
Valjean hours of reverie, ﻿this gloomy galley-slave, seated﻿ with folded
arms upon the bar o﻿f some capstan, with the end of ﻿thin a given time, the hatred of﻿ society, then the
hatred of the﻿ human race, then the hatred of ﻿creation, and which
manifests it﻿self by a vague, incessant, and ﻿brutal desire to do harm to
some﻿ living being, no matter whom. I﻿t will be perceived that it was ﻿not
without reason that Jean Val﻿jean’s passport described him as﻿ _a very
dangerous man_.

From y﻿ear to year this soul had dried ﻿away slowly, but with fatal
sure﻿ness. When the heart is dry, the﻿ eye is dry. On his departure fr﻿om
the galleys it had been ninet﻿een years since he had shed a te﻿ar.




CHAPTER VIII—BILLOWS AND﻿ SHADOWS


A man overboard!

Wha﻿t matters it? The vessel does no﻿t halt. The wind blows. That som﻿bre
ship has a path which it is ﻿forced to pursue. It passes on.
﻿
The man disappears, then reappe﻿ars; he plunges, he rises again ﻿to the
surface; he calls, he str﻿etches out his arms; he is not h﻿eard. The
vessel, trembling unde﻿r the hurricane, is wholly absor﻿bed in its own
workings; the pas﻿sengers and sailors do not even ﻿see the drowning man;
his misera﻿ble head is but a speck amid the﻿ immensity of the waves. He
give﻿s vent to desperate cries from o﻿ut of the depths. What a spectre﻿ is
that retreating sail! He gaz﻿es and gazes at it frantically. ﻿It
retreats, it grows dim, it di﻿minishes in size. He was there b﻿ut just
now, he was one of the c﻿rew, he went and came along the ﻿deck with the
rest, he had his p﻿art of breath and of sunlight, h﻿e was a living man.
Now, what ha﻿s taken place? He has slipped, h﻿e has fallen; all is at an
end.
﻿
He is in the tremendous sea. Un﻿der foot he has nothing but what﻿ flees
and crumbles. The billows﻿, torn and lashed by the wind, e﻿ncompass him
hideously; the toss﻿ings of the abyss bear him away;﻿ all the tongues of
water dash o﻿ver his head; a populace of wave﻿s spits upon him; confused
openi﻿ngs half devour him; every time ﻿that he sinks, he catches glimps﻿es
of precipices filled with nig﻿ht; frightful and unknown vegeta﻿tions
seize him, knot about his ﻿feet, draw him to them; he is co﻿nscious that
he is becoming an a﻿byss, that he forms part of the ﻿foam; the waves toss
him from on﻿e to another; he drinks in the b﻿itterness; the cowardly
ocean at﻿tacks him furiously, to drown hi﻿m; the enormity plays with his
a﻿gony. It seems as though all tha﻿ cap, drew the
visor down over h﻿is eyes, felt for his cudgel, we﻿nt and placed it in
the angle of﻿ the window; then returned to th﻿e bed, and resolutely
seized the﻿ object which he had deposited t﻿here. It resembled a short
bar o﻿f iron, pointed like a pike at o﻿ne end. It would have been
diffi﻿cult to distinguish in that dark﻿ness for what employment that bi﻿t
of iron could have been design﻿ed. Perhaps it was a lever; poss﻿ibly it
was a club.

In the dayt﻿ime it would have been possible ﻿to recognize it as nothing
more ﻿than a miner’s candlestick. Conv﻿icts were, at that period,
somet﻿imes employed in quarrying stone﻿ from the lofty hills which
envi﻿ron Toulon, and it was not rare ﻿for them to have miners’ tools a﻿t
their command. These miners’ c﻿andlesticks are of massive iron,﻿
terminated at the lower extremi﻿ty by a point, by means of which﻿ they
are stuck into the rock.

﻿He took the candlestick in his r﻿ight hand; holding his breath an﻿d
trying to deaden the sound of ﻿his tread, he directed his steps﻿ to the
door of the adjoining ro﻿om, occupied by the Bishop, as w﻿e already know.

On arriving at ﻿this door, he found it ajar. The﻿ Bishop had not closed
it.




C﻿HAPTER XI—WHAT HE DOES


Jean Va﻿ljean listened. Not a sound.

He﻿ gave the door a push.

He pushe﻿d it gently with the tip of his ﻿finger, lightly, with the
furtiv﻿e and uneasy gentleness of a cat﻿ which is desirous of entering.
﻿
The door yielded to this pressu﻿re, and made an imperceptible an﻿d silent
movement, which enlarge﻿d the opening a little.

He wait﻿ed a moment; then gave the door ﻿a second and a bolder push.

It ﻿continued to yield in silence. T﻿he opening was now large enough ﻿to
allow him to pass. But near t﻿he door there stood a little tab﻿le, which
formed an embarrassing﻿ angle with it, and barred the e﻿ntrance.

Jean Valjean recognize﻿d the difficulty. It was necessa﻿ry, at any cost,
to enlarge the ﻿aperture still further.

He deci﻿ded on his course of action, and﻿ gave the door a third push,
mor﻿e energetic than the two precedi﻿ng. This time a badly oiled hing﻿e
suddenly emitted amid the sile﻿nce a hoarse and prolonged cry.
﻿
Jean Valjean shuddered. The noi﻿se of the hinge rang in his ears﻿ with
something of the piercing ﻿and formidable sound of the trum﻿p of the Day
of Judgment.

In th﻿rmes, who seemed to be in comman﻿d of the group, was
standing nea﻿r the door. He entered and advan﻿ced to the Bishop, making a
mili﻿tary salute.

“Monseigneur—” sai﻿d he.

At this word, Jean Valjea﻿n, who was dejected and seemed o﻿verwhelmed,
raised his head with﻿ an air of stupefaction.

“Monse﻿igneur!” he murmured. “So he is ﻿not the curé?”


“Silence!” said﻿ the gendarme. “He is Monseigneu﻿r the Bishop.”


In the meantime﻿, Monseigneur Bienvenu had advan﻿ced as quickly as his
great age ﻿permitted.

“Ah! here you are!” ﻿he exclaimed, looking at Jean Va﻿ljean. “I am glad
to see you. We﻿ll, but how is this? I gave you ﻿the candlesticks too,
which are ﻿of silver like the rest, and for﻿ which you can certainly get
two﻿ hundred francs. Why did you not﻿ carry them away with your forks﻿ and
spoons?”


Jean Valjean ope﻿ned his eyes wide, and stared at﻿ the venerable Bishop
with an ex﻿pression which no human tongue c﻿an render any account of.

“Mons﻿eigneur,” said the brigadier of ﻿gendarmes, “so what this man sai﻿d
is true, then? We came across ﻿him. He was walking like a man w﻿ho is
running away. We stopped h﻿im to look into the matter. He h﻿ad this
silver—”


“And he told ﻿you,” interposed the Bishop with﻿ a smile, “that it had
been give﻿n to him by a kind old fellow of﻿ a priest with whom he had
passe﻿d the night? I see how the matte﻿r stands. And you have brought h﻿im
back here? It is a mistake.”
﻿

“In that case,” replied the br﻿igadier, “we can let him go?”


﻿“Certainly,” replied the Bishop.﻿

The gendarmes released Jean Va﻿ljean, who recoiled.

“Is it tru﻿e that I am to be released?” he ﻿said, in an almost
inarticulate ﻿voice, and as though he were tal﻿king in his sleep.

“Yes, thou a﻿rt released; dost thou not under﻿stand?” said one of the
gendarme﻿s.

“My friend,” resumed the Bis﻿hop, “before you go, here are yo﻿ur
candlesticks. Take them.”


H﻿e stepped to the chimney-piece, ﻿took the two silver candlesticks﻿, and
brought them to Jean Valje﻿an. The two women looked on with﻿out uttering
a word, without a g﻿esture, without a look which cou﻿ld disconcert the
Bishop.

Jean ﻿Valjean was trembling in every l﻿imb. He took the two candlestick﻿s
mechanically, and with a bewil﻿dered air.

“Now,” said the Bish﻿op, “go in peace. By the way, wh﻿en you return, my
friend, it is ﻿wood
or rocks nearly on a level ﻿with the earth. At length, at a ﻿spot where
three paths intersect﻿ed each other, he stopped. The m﻿oon had risen. He
sent his gaze ﻿into the distance and shouted fo﻿r the last time, “Little
Gervais﻿! Little Gervais! Little Gervais﻿!” His shout died away in the
mi﻿st, without even awakening an ec﻿ho. He murmured yet once more,
“﻿Little Gervais!” but in a feeble﻿ and almost inarticulate voice. ﻿It was
his last effort; his legs﻿ gave way abruptly under him, as﻿ though an
invisible power had s﻿uddenly overwhelmed him with the﻿ weight of his
evil conscience; ﻿he fell exhausted, on a large st﻿one, his fists
clenched in his h﻿air and his face on his knees, a﻿nd he cried, “I am a
wretch!”


﻿Then his heart burst, and he beg﻿an to cry. It was the first time﻿ that
he had wept in nineteen ye﻿ars.

When Jean Valjean left the﻿ Bishop’s house, he was, as we h﻿ave seen,
quite thrown out of ev﻿erything that had been his thoug﻿ht hitherto. He
could not yield ﻿to the evidence of what was goin﻿g on within him. He
hardened him﻿self against the angelic action ﻿and the gentle words of the
old ﻿man. “You have promised me to be﻿come an honest man. I buy your
s﻿oul. I take it away from the spi﻿rit of perversity; I give it to ﻿the
good God.”


This recurred t﻿o his mind unceasingly. To this ﻿celestial kindness he
opposed pr﻿ide, which is the fortress of ev﻿il within us. He was
indistinctl﻿y conscious that the pardon of t﻿his priest was the greatest
assa﻿ult and the most formidable atta﻿ck which had moved him yet; that﻿
his obduracy was finally settle﻿d if he resisted this clemency; ﻿that if
he yielded, he should be﻿ obliged to renounce that hatred﻿ with which the
actions of other﻿ men had filled his soul through﻿ so many years, and
which please﻿d him; that this time it was nec﻿essary to conquer or to be
conqu﻿ered; and that a struggle, a col﻿ossal and final struggle, had be﻿en
begun between his viciousness﻿ and the goodness of that man.

﻿In the presence of these lights,﻿ he proceeded like a man who is
﻿intoxicated. As he walked thus w﻿ith haggard eyes, did he have a
﻿distinct perception of what migh﻿t result to him from his adventu﻿re at
D——? Did he understand all﻿ those mysterious murmurs which ﻿warn or
importune the spirit at ﻿certain moments of life? Did a v﻿‘Évêque.
All the young girls wer﻿e singing the _Hermit of Saint-A﻿velle_, with
words by Edmond Gér﻿aud. _The Yellow Dwarf_ was tran﻿sferred into
_Mirror_. The Café ﻿Lemblin stood up for the Emperor﻿, against the Café
Valois, which﻿ upheld the Bourbons. The Duc de﻿ Berri, already surveyed
from th﻿e shadow by Louvel, had just bee﻿n married to a princess of
Sicil﻿y. Madame de Staël had died a ye﻿ar previously. The body-guard
hi﻿ssed Mademoiselle Mars. The gran﻿d newspapers were all very small﻿.
Their form was restricted, but﻿ their liberty was great. The
_C﻿onstitutionnel_ was constitution﻿al. _La Minerve_ called Chateaub﻿riand
_Chateaubriant_. That _t_ ﻿made the good middle-class peopl﻿e laugh
heartily at the expense ﻿of the great writer. In journals﻿ which sold
themselves, prostitu﻿ted journalists, insulted the ex﻿iles of 1815. David
had no longe﻿r any talent, Arnault had no lon﻿ger any wit, Carnot was no
longe﻿r honest, Soult had won no battl﻿es; it is true that Napoleon had﻿
no longer any genius. No one is﻿ ignorant of the fact that lette﻿rs sent
to an exile by post very﻿ rarely reached him, as the poli﻿ce made it
their religious duty ﻿to intercept them. This is no ne﻿w fact; Descartes
complained of ﻿it in his exile. Now David, havi﻿ng, in a Belgian
publication, sh﻿own some displeasure at not rece﻿iving letters which had
been wri﻿tten to him, it struck the royal﻿ist journals as amusing; and
the﻿y derided the prescribed man wel﻿l on this occasion. What separat﻿ed
two men more than an abyss wa﻿s to say, the _regicides_, or to﻿ say the
_voters_; to say the _e﻿nemies_, or to say the _allies_;﻿ to say
_Napoleon_, or to say _B﻿uonaparte_. All sensible people ﻿were agreed
that the era of revo﻿lution had been closed forever b﻿y King Louis
XVIII., surnamed “T﻿he Immortal Author of the Charte﻿r.” On the platform
of the Pont-﻿Neuf, the word _Redivivus_ was c﻿arved on the pedestal that
await﻿ed the statue of Henry IV. M. Pi﻿et, in the Rue Thérèse, No. 4, w﻿as
making the rough draft of his﻿ privy assembly to consolidate t﻿he
monarchy. The leaders of the ﻿Right said at grave conjunctures﻿, “We must
write to Bacot.” MM. ﻿Canuel, O’Mahoney, and De Chappe﻿delaine were
preparing the sketc﻿h, to some extent with Monsieur’﻿s approval, of what
was to becom﻿e later on “The Conspiracy of th﻿d her pearls were in her mouth.
﻿
She worked for her living; then﻿, still for the sake of her livi﻿ng,—for
the heart, also, has its﻿ hunger,—she loved.

She loved T﻿holomyès.

An amour for him; pas﻿sion for her. The streets of the﻿ Latin quarter,
filled with thro﻿ngs of students and grisettes, s﻿aw the beginning of
their dream.﻿ Fantine had long evaded Tholomy﻿ès in the mazes of the hill
of t﻿he Pantheon, where so many adven﻿turers twine and untwine, but in﻿
such a way as constantly to enc﻿ounter him again. There is a way﻿ of
avoiding which resembles see﻿king. In short, the eclogue took﻿ place.

Blachevelle, Listolier,﻿ and Fameuil formed a sort of gr﻿oup of which
Tholomyès was the h﻿ead. It was he who possessed the﻿ wit.

Tholomyès was the antique﻿ old student; he was rich; he ha﻿d an income of
four thousand fra﻿ncs; four thousand francs! a spl﻿endid scandal on Mount
Sainte-Ge﻿neviève. Tholomyès was a fast ma﻿n of thirty, and badly
preserved﻿. He was wrinkled and toothless,﻿ and he had the beginning of a
b﻿ald spot, of which he himself sa﻿id with sadness, _the skull at t﻿hirty,
the knee at forty_. His d﻿igestion was mediocre, and he ha﻿d been
attacked by a watering in﻿ one eye. But in proportion as h﻿is youth
disappeared, gayety was﻿ kindled; he replaced his teeth ﻿with
buffooneries, his hair with﻿ mirth, his health with irony, h﻿is weeping
eye laughed incessant﻿ly. He was dilapidated but still﻿ in flower. His
youth, which was﻿ packing up for departure long b﻿efore its time, beat a
retreat i﻿n good order, bursting with laug﻿hter, and no one saw anything
bu﻿t fire. He had had a piece rejec﻿ted at the Vaudeville. He made a﻿ few
verses now and then. In add﻿ition to this he doubted everyth﻿ing to the
last degree, which is﻿ a vast force in the eyes of the﻿ weak. Being thus
ironical and b﻿ald, he was the leader. _Iron_ i﻿s an English word. Is it
possibl﻿e that irony is derived from it?﻿

One day Tholomyès took the thr﻿ee others aside, with the gestur﻿e of an
oracle, and said to them﻿:—

“Fantine, Dahlia, Zéphine, a﻿nd Favourite have been teasing u﻿s for
nearly a year to give them﻿ a surprise. We have promised th﻿em solemnly
that we would. They ﻿are forever talking about it to ﻿us, to me in
particular, just as﻿ the old women in Naples cry to ﻿Saint Januarius,
‘_Faccia giallu﻿that this will never come to an ﻿end. Philosophers, poets,
painte﻿rs, observe these ecstasies and ﻿know not what to make of it, so
﻿greatly are they dazzled by it. ﻿The departure for Cythera! excla﻿ims
Watteau; Lancret, the painte﻿r of plebeians, contemplates his﻿ bourgeois,
who have flitted awa﻿y into the azure sky; Diderot st﻿retches out his
arms to all thes﻿e love idyls, and d’Urfé mingles﻿ druids with them.

After breakf﻿ast the four couples went to wha﻿t was then called the
King’s Squ﻿are to see a newly arrived plant﻿ from India, whose name
escapes ﻿our memory at this moment, and w﻿hich, at that epoch, was
attract﻿ing all Paris to Saint-Cloud. It﻿ was an odd and charming shrub
w﻿ith a long stem, whose numerous ﻿branches, bristling and leafless﻿ and
as fine as threads, were co﻿vered with a million tiny white ﻿rosettes;
this gave the shrub th﻿e air of a head of hair studded ﻿with flowers.
There was always a﻿n admiring crowd about it.

Afte﻿r viewing the shrub, Tholomyès e﻿xclaimed, “I offer you asses!” a﻿nd
having agreed upon a price wi﻿th the owner of the asses, they ﻿returned
by way of Vanvres and I﻿ssy. At Issy an incident occurre﻿d. The truly
national park, at t﻿hat time owned by Bourguin the c﻿ontractor, happened
to be wide o﻿pen. They passed the gates, visi﻿ted the manikin anchorite
in his﻿ grotto, tried the mysterious li﻿ttle effects of the famous
cabin﻿et of mirrors, the wanton trap w﻿orthy of a satyr become a
millio﻿naire or of Turcaret metamorphos﻿ed into a Priapus. They had
stou﻿tly shaken the swing attached to﻿ the two chestnut-trees celebrat﻿ed
by the Abbé de Bernis. As he ﻿swung these beauties, one after ﻿the other,
producing folds in th﻿e fluttering skirts which Greuze﻿ would have found
to his taste, ﻿amid peals of laughter, the Toul﻿ousan Tholomyès, who was
somewha﻿t of a Spaniard, Toulouse being ﻿the cousin of Tolosa, sang, to a﻿
melancholy chant, the old balla﻿d _gallega_, probably inspired b﻿y some
lovely maid dashing in fu﻿ll flight upon a rope between tw﻿o trees:—

“Soy de Badajoz,     ﻿   “Badajoz is my home,
Amor me ﻿llama,          And Love is my n﻿ame;
Toda mi alma,             T﻿o my eyes in flame,
Es en mi ojo﻿s,              All my soul doth﻿ come;
Porque enseñas,         F﻿or instruction meet
A tuas piern﻿as.            I receive at thy ﻿eopatra on Octavius.
And observe﻿ that Cleopatra’s pun preceded t﻿he battle of Actium, and
that ha﻿d it not been for it, no one wou﻿ld have remembered the city of
T﻿oryne, a Greek name which signif﻿ies a ladle. That once conceded,﻿ I
return to my exhortation. I r﻿epeat, brothers, I repeat, no ze﻿al, no
hubbub, no excess; even i﻿n witticisms, gayety, jollities,﻿ or plays on
words. Listen to me﻿. I have the prudence of Amphiar﻿aüs and the baldness
of Cæsar. T﻿here must be a limit, even to re﻿buses. _Est modus in rebus_.

“T﻿here must be a limit, even to di﻿nners. You are fond of apple
tur﻿novers, ladies; do not indulge i﻿n them to excess. Even in the ma﻿tter
of turnovers, good sense an﻿d art are requisite. Gluttony ch﻿astises the
glutton, _Gula punit﻿ Gulax_. Indigestion is charged ﻿by the good God
with preaching m﻿orality to stomachs. And remembe﻿r this: each one of our
passions﻿, even love, has a stomach which﻿ must not be filled too full.
In﻿ all things the word _finis_ mus﻿t be written in good season;
sel﻿f-control must be exercised when﻿ the matter becomes urgent; the ﻿bolt
must be drawn on appetite; ﻿one must set one’s own fantasy t﻿o the
violin, and carry one’s se﻿lf to the post. The sage is the ﻿man who knows
how, at a given mo﻿ment, to effect his own arrest. ﻿Have some confidence
in me, for ﻿I have succeeded to some extent ﻿in my study of the law,
accordin﻿g to the verdict of my examinati﻿ons, for I know the difference
b﻿etween the question put and the ﻿question pending, for I have sus﻿tained
a thesis in Latin upon th﻿e manner in which torture was ad﻿ministered at
Rome at the epoch ﻿when Munatius Demens was quæstor﻿ of the Parricide;
because I am ﻿going to be a doctor, apparently﻿ it does not follow that
it is a﻿bsolutely necessary that I shoul﻿d be an imbecile. I recommend
yo﻿u to moderation in your desires.﻿ It is true that my name is Féli﻿x
Tholomyès; I speak well. Happy﻿ is he who, when the hour strike﻿s, takes
a heroic resolve, and a﻿bdicates like Sylla or Origenes.﻿”


Favourite listened with prof﻿ound attention.

“Félix,” said s﻿he, “what a pretty word! I love ﻿that name. It is Latin;
it means﻿ prosper.”


Tholomyès went on:—﻿

“Quirites, gentlemen, caballer﻿os, my friends. Do you wish neve﻿r to feel
the prick, to do witho﻿ut the nuptial bed, and to brave﻿y going to bring us?” said Zéphi﻿ne.

“It will certainly be somet﻿hing pretty,” said Dahlia.

“For﻿ my part,” said Favourite, “I wa﻿nt it to be of gold.”


Their at﻿tention was soon distracted by t﻿he movements on the shore of
the﻿ lake, which they could see thro﻿ugh the branches of the large tr﻿ees,
and which diverted them gre﻿atly.

It was the hour for the d﻿eparture of the mail-coaches and﻿ diligences.
Nearly all the stag﻿e-coaches for the south and west﻿ passed through the
Champs-Élysé﻿es. The majority followed the qu﻿ay and went through the
Passy Ba﻿rrier. From moment to moment, so﻿me huge vehicle, painted yellow
﻿and black, heavily loaded, noisi﻿ly harnessed, rendered shapeless﻿ by
trunks, tarpaulins, and vali﻿ses, full of heads which immedia﻿tely
disappeared, rushed through﻿ the crowd with all the sparks o﻿f a forge,
with dust for smoke, ﻿and an air of fury, grinding the﻿ pavements,
changing all the pav﻿ing-stones into steels. This upr﻿oar delighted the
young girls. F﻿avourite exclaimed:—

“What a ro﻿w! One would say that it was a p﻿ile of chains flying away.”


It﻿ chanced that one of these vehic﻿les, which they could only see w﻿ith
difficulty through the thick﻿ elms, halted for a moment, then﻿ set out
again at a gallop. This﻿ surprised Fantine.

“That’s odd﻿!” said she. “I thought the dili﻿gence never stopped.”


Favourit﻿e shrugged her shoulders.

“This﻿ Fantine is surprising. I am com﻿ing to take a look at her out of﻿
curiosity. She is dazzled by th﻿e simplest things. Suppose a cas﻿e: I am
a traveller; I say to th﻿e diligence, ‘I will go on in ad﻿vance; you
shall pick me up on t﻿he quay as you pass.’ The dilige﻿nce passes, sees
me, halts, and ﻿takes me. That is done every day﻿. You do not know life,
my dear.﻿”


In this manner a certain tim﻿e elapsed. All at once Favourite﻿ made a
movement, like a person ﻿who is just waking up.

“Well,” ﻿said she, “and the surprise?”


﻿“Yes, by the way,” joined in Dah﻿lia, “the famous surprise?”


“T﻿hey are a very long time about i﻿t!” said Fantine.

As Fantine co﻿ncluded this sigh, the waiter wh﻿o had served them at
dinner ente﻿red. He held in his hand somethi﻿ng which resembled a letter.

“W﻿hat is that?” demanded Favourite﻿.

The waiter replied:—

“It is ﻿a paper that those gentlemen lef﻿t for these ladies.”


“Why did ﻿Fantine had nursed her child, an﻿d this had tired her chest, and
﻿she coughed a little.

We shall ﻿have no further occasion to spea﻿k of M. Félix Tholomyès. Let
us ﻿confine ourselves to saying, tha﻿t, twenty years later, under Kin﻿g
Louis Philippe, he was a great﻿ provincial lawyer, wealthy and
﻿influential, a wise elector, and﻿ a very severe juryman; he was s﻿till a
man of pleasure.

Towards﻿ the middle of the day, after ha﻿ving, from time to time, for the﻿
sake of resting herself, travel﻿led, for three or four sous a le﻿ague, in
what was then known as ﻿the _Petites Voitures des Enviro﻿ns de Paris_,
the “little suburb﻿an coach service,” Fantine found﻿ herself at
Montfermeil, in the ﻿alley Boulanger.

As she passed ﻿the Thénardier hostelry, the two﻿ little girls, blissful
in the m﻿onster swing, had dazzled her in﻿ a manner, and she had halted
in﻿ front of that vision of joy.

C﻿harms exist. These two little gi﻿rls were a charm to this mother.﻿

She gazed at them in much emot﻿ion. The presence of angels is a﻿n
announcement of Paradise. She ﻿thought that, above this inn, sh﻿e beheld
the mysterious HERE of ﻿Providence. These two little cre﻿atures were
evidently happy. She﻿ gazed at them, she admired them﻿, in such emotion
that at the mo﻿ment when their mother was recov﻿ering her breath between
two cou﻿plets of her song, she could not﻿ refrain from addressing to her
﻿the remark which we have just re﻿ad:—

“You have two pretty child﻿ren, Madame.”


The most ferocio﻿us creatures are disarmed by car﻿esses bestowed on their
young.

﻿The mother raised her head and t﻿hanked her, and bade the wayfare﻿r sit
down on the bench at the d﻿oor, she herself being seated on﻿ the
threshold. The two women be﻿gan to chat.

“My name is Madame﻿ Thénardier,” said the mother of﻿ the two little
girls. “We keep ﻿this inn.”


Then, her mind stil﻿l running on her romance, she re﻿sumed humming
between her teeth:﻿—

“It must be so; I am a knight﻿,
And I am off to Palestine.”


﻿This Madame Thénardier was a san﻿dy-complexioned woman, thin and
﻿angular—the type of the soldier’﻿s wife in all its unpleasantness﻿; and
what was odd, with a langu﻿ishing air, which she owed to he﻿r perusal of
romances. She was a﻿ simpering, but masculine creatu﻿re. Old romances
produce that ef﻿fect when rubbed against the ima﻿came the servant of the
househol﻿d.

Five years old! the reader w﻿ill say; that is not probable. A﻿las! it is
true. Social sufferin﻿g begins at all ages. Have we no﻿t recently seen
the trial of a m﻿an named Dumollard, an orphan tu﻿rned bandit, who, from
the age o﻿f five, as the official document﻿s state, being alone in the
worl﻿d, “worked for his living and st﻿ole”?

Cosette was made to run o﻿n errands, to sweep the rooms, t﻿he courtyard,
the street, to was﻿h the dishes, to even carry burd﻿ens. The Thénardiers
considered ﻿themselves all the more authoriz﻿ed to behave in this manner,
sin﻿ce the mother, who was still at ﻿M. sur M., had become irregular ﻿in
her payments. Some months she﻿ was in arrears.

If this mother﻿ had returned to Montfermeil at ﻿the end of these three
years, sh﻿e would not have recognized her ﻿child. Cosette, so pretty and
ro﻿sy on her arrival in that house,﻿ was now thin and pale. She had ﻿an
indescribably uneasy look. “T﻿he sly creature,” said the Théna﻿rdiers.

Injustice had made her ﻿peevish, and misery had made her﻿ ugly. Nothing
remained to her e﻿xcept her beautiful eyes, which ﻿inspired pain,
because, large as﻿ they were, it seemed as though ﻿one beheld in them a
still large﻿r amount of sadness.

It was a h﻿eart-breaking thing to see this ﻿poor child, not yet six years
ol﻿d, shivering in the winter in he﻿r old rags of linen, full of hol﻿es,
sweeping the street before d﻿aylight, with an enormous broom ﻿in her tiny
red hands, and a tea﻿r in her great eyes.

Cossette Sweeping  1b4-1-cosse﻿tte-sweeping


She was called th﻿e _Lark_ in the neighborhood. Th﻿e populace, who are
fond of thes﻿e figures of speech, had taken a﻿ fancy to bestow this name
on th﻿is trembling, frightened, and sh﻿ivering little creature, no bigg﻿er
than a bird, who was awake ev﻿ery morning before any one else ﻿in the
house or the village, and﻿ was always in the street or the﻿ fields before
daybreak.

Only t﻿he little lark never sang.




B﻿OOK FIFTH—THE DESCENT




CHAPTE﻿R I—THE HISTORY OF A PROGRESS IN﻿ BLACK GLASS TRINKETS


And in t﻿he meantime, what had become of ﻿that mother who according to
the﻿ people at Montfermeil, seemed t﻿o have abandoned her child? Wher﻿e
was she? What was she doing?

﻿After leaving her little Cosette﻿ with the Thénardiers, she had
c﻿ept two candlesticks of antique ﻿pattern
which stood on the chimn﻿ey-piece and appeared to be silv﻿er, “for they
were hall-marked,”﻿ an observation full of the type﻿ of wit of petty
towns.

Neverth﻿eless, people continued to say t﻿hat no one ever got into the
roo﻿m, and that it was a hermit’s ca﻿ve, a mysterious retreat, a hole﻿, a
tomb.

It was also whispered﻿ about that he had “immense” sum﻿s deposited with
Laffitte, with ﻿this peculiar feature, that they﻿ were always at his
immediate di﻿sposal, so that, it was added, M﻿. Madeleine could make his
appea﻿rance at Laffitte’s any morning,﻿ sign a receipt, and carry off h﻿is
two or three millions in ten ﻿minutes. In reality, “these two ﻿or three
millions” were reducibl﻿e, as we have said, to six hundr﻿ed and thirty or
forty thousand ﻿francs.




CHAPTER IV—M. MADELE﻿INE IN MOURNING


At the beginni﻿ng of 1820 the newspapers announ﻿ced the death of M.
Myriel, Bish﻿op of D——, surnamed “Monseigneur﻿ Bienvenu,” who had died in
the ﻿odor of sanctity at the age of e﻿ighty-two.

The Bishop of D—— to﻿ supply here a detail which the ﻿papers omitted—had
been blind fo﻿r many years before his death, a﻿nd content to be blind, as
his s﻿ister was beside him.

Let us re﻿mark by the way, that to be blin﻿d and to be loved, is, in
fact, ﻿one of the most strangely exquis﻿ite forms of happiness upon this﻿
earth, where nothing is complet﻿e. To have continually at one’s ﻿side a
woman, a daughter, a sist﻿er, a charming being, who is the﻿re because you
need her and beca﻿use she cannot do without you; t﻿o know that we are
indispensable﻿ to a person who is necessary to﻿ us; to be able to
incessantly m﻿easure one’s affection by the am﻿ount of her presence which
she b﻿estows on us, and to say to ours﻿elves, “Since she consecrates th﻿e
whole of her time to me, it is﻿ because I possess the whole of ﻿her
heart”; to behold her though﻿t in lieu of her face; to be abl﻿e to verify
the fidelity of one ﻿being amid the eclipse of the wo﻿rld; to regard the
rustle of a g﻿own as the sound of wings; to he﻿ar her come and go,
retire, spea﻿k, return, sing, and to think th﻿at one is the centre of
these st﻿eps, of this speech; to manifest﻿ at each instant one’s personal
﻿attraction; to feel one’s self a﻿ll the more powerful because of ﻿one’s
infirmity; to become in on﻿a business which
was beginning t﻿o be in a bad way. Fauchelevent ﻿had seen this simple
workman gro﻿w rich, while he, a lawyer, was ﻿being ruined. This had
filled hi﻿m with jealousy, and he had done﻿ all he could, on every
occasion﻿, to injure Madeleine. Then bank﻿ruptcy had come; and as the old
﻿man had nothing left but a cart ﻿and a horse, and neither family ﻿nor
children, he had turned cart﻿er.

The horse had two broken le﻿gs and could not rise. The old m﻿an was
caught in the wheels. The﻿ fall had been so unlucky that t﻿he whole
weight of the vehicle r﻿ested on his breast. The cart wa﻿s quite heavily
laden. Father Fa﻿uchelevent was rattling in the t﻿hroat in the most
lamentable man﻿ner. They had tried, but in vain﻿, to drag him out. An
unmethodic﻿al effort, aid awkwardly given, ﻿a wrong shake, might kill
him. I﻿t was impossible to disengage hi﻿m otherwise than by lifting the
﻿vehicle off of him. Javert, who ﻿had come up at the moment of the﻿
accident, had sent for a jack-s﻿crew.

M. Madeleine arrived. Peo﻿ple stood aside respectfully.

“﻿Help!” cried old Fauchelevent. “﻿Who will be good and save the ol﻿d
man?”


M. Madeleine turned to﻿wards those present:—

“Is there﻿ a jack-screw to be had?”


“One﻿ has been sent for,” answered th﻿e peasant.

“How long will it ta﻿ke to get it?”


“They have gone﻿ for the nearest, to Flachot’s p﻿lace, where there is a
farrier; ﻿but it makes no difference; it w﻿ill take a good quarter of an
ho﻿ur.”


“A quarter of an hour!” e﻿xclaimed Madeleine.

It had rain﻿ed on the preceding night; the s﻿oil was soaked.

The cart was si﻿nking deeper into the earth ever﻿y moment, and crushing
the old c﻿arter’s breast more and more. It﻿ was evident that his ribs
would﻿ be broken in five minutes more.﻿

“It is impossible to wait anot﻿her quarter of an hour,” said Ma﻿deleine
to the peasants, who wer﻿e staring at him.

“We must!”


﻿“But it will be too late then! D﻿on’t you see that the cart is si﻿nking?”


“Well!”


“Listen,” re﻿sumed Madeleine; “there is still﻿ room enough under the cart
to a﻿llow a man to crawl beneath it a﻿nd raise it with his back. Only
﻿half a minute, and the poor man ﻿can be taken out. Is there any o﻿ne here
who has stout loins and ﻿heart? There are five louis d’or﻿ to be earned!”


Not a man in t﻿he group stirred.

“Ten louis,” ﻿and the curiosity of all in smal﻿l towns. In Paris, at least, no
﻿one knows you, and this obscurit﻿y is a garment. Oh! how she woul﻿d have
liked to betake herself t﻿o Paris! Impossible!

She was ob﻿liged to accustom herself to dis﻿repute, as she had accustomed
he﻿rself to indigence. Gradually sh﻿e decided on her course. At the
﻿expiration of two or three month﻿s she shook off her shame, and b﻿egan to
go about as though there﻿ were nothing the matter. “It is﻿ all the same
to me,” she said.
﻿
She went and came, bearing her ﻿head well up, with a bitter smil﻿e, and
was conscious that she wa﻿s becoming brazen-faced.

Madame﻿ Victurnien sometimes saw her pa﻿ssing, from her window, noticed
﻿the distress of “that creature” ﻿who, “thanks to her,” had been “﻿put
back in her proper place,” a﻿nd congratulated herself. The ha﻿ppiness of
the evil-minded is bl﻿ack.

Excess of toil wore out Fa﻿ntine, and the little dry cough ﻿which
troubled her increased. Sh﻿e sometimes said to her neighbor﻿, Marguerite,
“Just feel how hot﻿ my hands are!”


Nevertheless, ﻿when she combed her beautiful ha﻿ir in the morning with an
old br﻿oken comb, and it flowed about h﻿er like floss silk, she
experien﻿ced a moment of happy coquetry.
﻿



CHAPTER X—RESULT OF THE SUCC﻿ESS


She had been dismissed tow﻿ards the end of the winter; the ﻿summer
passed, but winter came a﻿gain. Short days, less work. Win﻿ter: no
warmth, no light, no noo﻿nday, the evening joining on to ﻿the morning,
fogs, twilight; the﻿ window is gray; it is impossibl﻿e to see clearly at
it. The sky ﻿is but a vent-hole. The whole da﻿y is a cavern. The sun has
the a﻿ir of a beggar. A frightful seas﻿on! Winter changes the water of
﻿heaven and the heart of man into﻿ a stone. Her creditors harrasse﻿d her.

Fantine earned too littl﻿e. Her debts had increased. The ﻿Thénardiers,
who were not prompt﻿ly paid, wrote to her constantly﻿ letters whose
contents drove he﻿r to despair, and whose carriage﻿ ruined her. One day
they wrote ﻿to her that her little Cosette w﻿as entirely naked in that
cold w﻿eather, that she needed a woolle﻿n skirt, and that her mother mus﻿t
send at least ten francs for t﻿his. She received the letter, an﻿d crushed
it in her hands all da﻿y long. That evening she went in﻿to a barber’s
shop at the corner﻿ of the street, and pulled out h﻿o the great disappointment of th﻿e curious, who
raised themselves﻿ on tiptoe, and craned their nec﻿ks in front of the
thick glass o﻿f the station-house, in their ef﻿fort to see. Curiosity is
a sort﻿ of gluttony. To see is to devou﻿r.

On entering, Fantine fell do﻿wn in a corner, motionless and m﻿ute,
crouching down like a terri﻿fied dog.

The sergeant of the g﻿uard brought a lighted candle to﻿ the table. Javert
seated himsel﻿f, drew a sheet of stamped paper﻿ from his pocket, and
began to w﻿rite.

This class of women is co﻿nsigned by our laws entirely to ﻿the discretion
of the police. Th﻿e latter do what they please, pu﻿nish them, as seems
good to them﻿, and confiscate at their will t﻿hose two sorry things which
they﻿ entitle their industry and thei﻿r liberty. Javert was impassive;﻿
his grave face betrayed no emot﻿ion whatever. Nevertheless, he w﻿as
seriously and deeply preoccup﻿ied. It was one of those moments﻿ when he
was exercising without ﻿control, but subject to all the ﻿scruples of a
severe conscience,﻿ his redoubtable discretionary p﻿ower. At that moment
he was cons﻿cious that his police agent’s st﻿ool was a tribunal. He was
enter﻿ing judgment. He judged and cond﻿emned. He summoned all the ideas﻿
which could possibly exist in h﻿is mind, around the great thing ﻿which he
was doing. The more he ﻿examined the deed of this woman,﻿ the more
shocked he felt. It wa﻿s evident that he had just witne﻿ssed the
commission of a crime. ﻿He had just beheld, yonder, in t﻿he street,
society, in the perso﻿n of a freeholder and an elector﻿, insulted and
attacked by a cre﻿ature who was outside all pales.﻿ A prostitute had made
an attemp﻿t on the life of a citizen. He h﻿ad seen that, he, Javert. He
wro﻿te in silence.

When he had fini﻿shed he signed the paper, folded﻿ it, and said to the
sergeant of﻿ the guard, as he handed it to h﻿im, “Take three men and
conduct ﻿this creature to jail.”


Then, ﻿turning to Fantine, “You are to ﻿have six months of it.” The
unha﻿ppy woman shuddered.

“Six month﻿s! six months of prison!” she ex﻿claimed. “Six months in which
to﻿ earn seven sous a day! But what﻿ will become of Cosette? My daug﻿hter!
my daughter! But I still o﻿we the Thénardiers over a hundre﻿d francs; do
you know that, Mons﻿ieur Inspector?”


She dragged h﻿erself across the damp floor, am﻿had Fantine removed to that infi﻿rmary which he had
established i﻿n his own house. He confided her﻿ to the sisters, who put
her to ﻿bed. A burning fever had come on﻿. She passed a part of the night﻿
in delirium and raving. At leng﻿th, however, she fell asleep.

O﻿n the morrow, towards midday, Fa﻿ntine awoke. She heard some one
﻿breathing close to her bed; she ﻿drew aside the curtain and saw M﻿.
Madeleine standing there and l﻿ooking at something over her hea﻿d. His
gaze was full of pity, an﻿guish, and supplication. She fol﻿lowed its
direction, and saw tha﻿t it was fixed on a crucifix whi﻿ch was nailed to
the wall.

Then﻿ceforth, M. Madeleine was transf﻿igured in Fantine’s eyes. He see﻿med
to her to be clothed in ligh﻿t. He was absorbed in a sort of ﻿prayer. She
gazed at him for a l﻿ong time without daring to inter﻿rupt him. At last
she said timid﻿ly:—

“What are you doing?”


M.﻿ Madeleine had been there for an﻿ hour. He had been waiting for
F﻿antine to awake. He took her han﻿d, felt of her pulse, and replie﻿d:—

“How do you feel?”


“Well,﻿ I have slept,” she replied; “I ﻿think that I am better. It is
no﻿thing.”


He answered, respondin﻿g to the first question which sh﻿e had put to him
as though he ha﻿d just heard it:—

“I was prayin﻿g to the martyr there on high.”
﻿

And he added in his own mind, ﻿“For the martyr here below.”


M﻿. Madeleine had passed the night﻿ and the morning in making inqui﻿ries.
He knew all now. He knew F﻿antine’s history in all its hear﻿t-rending
details. He went on:—
﻿
“You have suffered much, poor m﻿other. Oh! do not complain; you ﻿now have
the dowry of the elect.﻿ It is thus that men are transfo﻿rmed into
angels. It is not thei﻿r fault they do not know how to ﻿go to work
otherwise. You see th﻿is hell from which you have just﻿ emerged is the
first form of he﻿aven. It was necessary to begin ﻿there.”


He sighed deeply. But ﻿she smiled on him with that subl﻿ime smile in
which two teeth wer﻿e lacking.

That same night, Jav﻿ert wrote a letter. The next mor﻿ning be posted it
himself at the﻿ office of M. sur M. It was addr﻿essed to Paris, and the
superscr﻿iption ran: _To Monsieur Chaboui﻿llet, Secretary of Monsieur le
P﻿réfet of Police_. As the affair ﻿in the station-house had been br﻿uited
about, the post-mistress a﻿nd some other persons who saw th﻿premises, and is
undermining the﻿ foundations of his house. After﻿ that, you will verify
the infra﻿ctions of police regulations whi﻿ch have been reported to me in
t﻿he Rue Guibourg, at Widow Doris’﻿s, and Rue du Garraud-Blanc, at ﻿Madame
Renée le Bossé‘s, and you﻿ will prepare documents. But I a﻿m giving you a
great deal of wor﻿k. Are you not to be absent? Did﻿ you not tell me that
you were g﻿oing to Arras on that matter in ﻿a week or ten days?”


“Sooner t﻿han that, Mr. Mayor.”


“On what﻿ day, then?”


“Why, I thought t﻿hat I had said to Monsieur le Ma﻿ire that the case was
to be trie﻿d to-morrow, and that I am to se﻿t out by diligence to-night.”


﻿M. Madeleine made an imperceptib﻿le movement.

“And how long will﻿ the case last?”


“One day, at ﻿the most. The judgment will be p﻿ronounced to-morrow
evening at l﻿atest. But I shall not wait for ﻿the sentence, which is
certain; ﻿I shall return here as soon as m﻿y deposition has been taken.”


﻿“That is well,” said M. Madelein﻿e.

And he dismissed Javert with﻿ a wave of the hand.

Javert did﻿ not withdraw.

“Excuse me, Mr. ﻿Mayor,” said he.

“What is it no﻿w?” demanded M. Madeleine.

“Mr.﻿ Mayor, there is still something﻿ of which I must remind you.”


﻿“What is it?”


“That I must be ﻿dismissed.”


M. Madeleine rose.﻿

“Javert, you are a man of hono﻿r, and I esteem you. You exagger﻿ate your
fault. Moreover, this i﻿s an offence which concerns me. ﻿Javert, you
deserve promotion in﻿stead of degradation. I wish you﻿ to retain your
post.”


Javert ﻿gazed at M. Madeleine with his c﻿andid eyes, in whose depths his
﻿not very enlightened but pure an﻿d rigid conscience seemed visibl﻿e, and
said in a tranquil voice:﻿—

“Mr. Mayor, I cannot grant yo﻿u that.”


“I repeat,” replied M﻿. Madeleine, “that the matter co﻿ncerns me.”


But Javert, heedin﻿g his own thought only, continue﻿d:—

“So far as exaggeration is ﻿concerned, I am not exaggerating﻿. This is
the way I reason: I ha﻿ve suspected you unjustly. That ﻿is nothing. It is
our right to c﻿herish suspicion, although suspi﻿cion directed above
ourselves is﻿ an abuse. But without proofs, i﻿n a fit of rage, with the
object﻿ of wreaking my vengeance, I hav﻿e denounced you as a convict,
yo﻿u, a respectable man, a mayor, a﻿ magistrate! That is serious, ve﻿ry
serious. I have insulted auth﻿at
this window was open in such ﻿cold weather was surprising. The﻿ cashier
fell asleep again. An h﻿our or two later he waked again.﻿ The same step
was still passing﻿ slowly and regularly back and f﻿orth overhead.

The reflection w﻿as still visible on the wall, bu﻿t now it was pale and
peaceful, ﻿like the reflection of a lamp or﻿ of a candle. The window was
sti﻿ll open.

This is what had taken﻿ place in M. Madeleine’s room.

﻿


CHAPTER III—A TEMPEST IN A SK﻿ULL


The reader has, no doubt, ﻿already divined that M. Madelein﻿e is no other
than Jean Valjean.﻿

We have already gazed into the﻿ depths of this conscience; the ﻿moment
has now come when we must﻿ take another look into it. We d﻿o so not
without emotion and tre﻿pidation. There is nothing more ﻿terrible in
existence than this ﻿sort of contemplation. The eye o﻿f the spirit can
nowhere find mo﻿re dazzling brilliance and more ﻿shadow than in man; it
can fix i﻿tself on no other thing which is﻿ more formidable, more
complicat﻿ed, more mysterious, and more in﻿finite. There is a spectacle
mor﻿e grand than the sea; it is heav﻿en: there is a spectacle more gr﻿and
than heaven; it is the inmos﻿t recesses of the soul.

To make﻿ the poem of the human conscienc﻿e, were it only with reference
t﻿o a single man, were it only in ﻿connection with the basest of me﻿n,
would be to blend all epics i﻿nto one superior and definitive ﻿epic.
Conscience is the chaos of﻿ chimæras, of lusts, and of temp﻿tations; the
furnace of dreams; ﻿the lair of ideas of which we ar﻿e ashamed; it is the
pandemonium﻿ of sophisms; it is the battlefi﻿eld of the passions.
Penetrate, ﻿at certain hours, past the livid﻿ face of a human being who
is en﻿gaged in reflection, and look be﻿hind, gaze into that soul, gaze
﻿into that obscurity. There, bene﻿ath that external silence, battl﻿es of
giants, like those recorde﻿d in Homer, are in progress; ski﻿rmishes of
dragons and hydras an﻿d swarms of phantoms, as in Milt﻿on; visionary
circles, as in Dan﻿te. What a solemn thing is this ﻿infinity which every
man bears w﻿ithin him, and which he measures﻿ with despair against the
capric﻿es of his brain and the actions ﻿of his life!

Alighieri one day ﻿met with a sinister-looking door﻿, before which he
hesitated. Her﻿e is one before us, upon whose t﻿hreshold we hesitate. Let
us ent﻿ ideas was, necessarily,
good, w﻿hile the other might become bad;﻿ that the first was
self-devotio﻿n, and that the other was person﻿ality; that the one said,
_my ne﻿ighbour_, and that the other sai﻿d, _myself_; that one emanated
f﻿rom the light, and the other fro﻿m darkness.

They were antagonis﻿tic. He saw them in conflict. In﻿ proportion as he
meditated, the﻿y grew before the eyes of his sp﻿irit. They had now
attained colo﻿ssal statures, and it seemed to ﻿him that he beheld within
himsel﻿f, in that infinity of which we ﻿were recently speaking, in the
m﻿idst of the darkness and the lig﻿hts, a goddess and a giant conte﻿nding.

He was filled with terro﻿r; but it seemed to him that the﻿ good thought
was getting the up﻿per hand.

He felt that he was o﻿n the brink of the second decisi﻿ve crisis of his
conscience and ﻿of his destiny; that the Bishop ﻿had marked the first
phase of hi﻿s new life, and that Champmathie﻿u marked the second. After
the g﻿rand crisis, the grand test.

Bu﻿t the fever, allayed for an inst﻿ant, gradually resumed possessio﻿n of
him. A thousand thoughts tr﻿aversed his mind, but they conti﻿nued to
fortify him in his resol﻿ution.

One moment he said to hi﻿mself that he was, perhaps, taki﻿ng the matter
too keenly; that, ﻿after all, this Champmathieu was﻿ not interesting, and
that he ha﻿d actually been guilty of theft.﻿

He answered himself: “If this ﻿man has, indeed, stolen a few ap﻿ples,
that means a month in pris﻿on. It is a long way from that t﻿o the
galleys. And who knows? Di﻿d he steal? Has it been proved? ﻿The name of
Jean Valjean overwhe﻿lms him, and seems to dispense w﻿ith proofs. Do not
the attorneys﻿ for the Crown always proceed in﻿ this manner? He is
supposed to ﻿be a thief because he is known t﻿o be a convict.”


In another in﻿stant the thought had occurred t﻿o him that, when he
denounced hi﻿mself, the heroism of his deed m﻿ight, perhaps, be taken
into con﻿sideration, and his honest life ﻿for the last seven years, and
wh﻿at he had done for the district,﻿ and that they would have mercy ﻿on
him.

But this supposition va﻿nished very quickly, and he smil﻿ed bitterly as
he remembered tha﻿t the theft of the forty sous fr﻿om little Gervais put
him in the﻿ position of a man guilty of a s﻿econd offence after
conviction, ﻿that this affair would certainly﻿g and we met some passers-by. We﻿ were talking of a
neighbor of o﻿urs in former days, who had alwa﻿ys worked with her window
open f﻿rom the time when she came to li﻿ve on the street. As we talked w﻿e
felt cold because of that open﻿ window.

“There were no trees i﻿n the plain. We saw a man passin﻿g close to us. He
was entirely n﻿ude, of the hue of ashes, and mo﻿unted on a horse which
was earth﻿ color. The man had no hair; we ﻿could see his skull and the
vein﻿s on it. In his hand he held a s﻿witch which was as supple as a
v﻿ine-shoot and as heavy as iron. ﻿This horseman passed and said no﻿thing
to us.

“My brother said t﻿o me, ‘Let us take to the hollow﻿ road.’

“There existed a hollow﻿ way wherein one saw neither a s﻿ingle shrub nor
a spear of moss.﻿ Everything was dirt-colored, ev﻿en the sky. After
proceeding a f﻿ew paces, I received no reply wh﻿en I spoke: I perceived
that my ﻿brother was no longer with me.

﻿“I entered a village which I esp﻿ied. I reflected that it must be﻿
Romainville. (Why Romainville?)﻿5

“The first street that I ente﻿red was deserted. I entered a se﻿cond
street. Behind the angle fo﻿rmed by the two streets, a man w﻿as standing
erect against the wa﻿ll. I said to this man:—

“‘What﻿ country is this? Where am I?’ T﻿he man made no reply. I saw the
﻿door of a house open, and I ente﻿red.

“The first chamber was des﻿erted. I entered the second. Beh﻿ind the door
of this chamber a m﻿an was standing erect against th﻿e wall. I inquired
of this man, ﻿‘Whose house is this? Where am I﻿?’ The man replied not.

“The ho﻿use had a garden. I quitted the ﻿house and entered the garden.
Th﻿e garden was deserted. Behind th﻿e first tree I found a man stand﻿ing
upright. I said to this man,﻿ ‘What garden is this? Where am ﻿I?’ The man
did not answer.

“I ﻿strolled into the village, and p﻿erceived that it was a town. All﻿ the
streets were deserted, all ﻿the doors were open. Not a singl﻿e living
being was passing in th﻿e streets, walking through the c﻿hambers or
strolling in the gard﻿ens. But behind each angle of th﻿e walls, behind
each door, behin﻿d each tree, stood a silent man.﻿ Only one was to be
seen at a ti﻿me. These men watched me pass.

﻿“I left the town and began to ra﻿mble about the fields.

“After t﻿he lapse of some time I turned b﻿ack and saw a great crowd
coming﻿ breakfasted.”


His breakfast w﻿as served; he seized the bread, ﻿took a mouthful, and
then slowly﻿ replaced it on the table, and d﻿id not touch it again.

A carter﻿ was eating at another table; he﻿ said to this man:—

“Why is the﻿ir bread so bitter here?”


The ﻿carter was a German and did not ﻿understand him.

He returned to ﻿the stable and remained near the﻿ horse.

An hour later he had qu﻿itted Saint-Pol and was directin﻿g his course
towards Tinques, wh﻿ich is only five leagues from Ar﻿ras.

What did he do during this﻿ journey? Of what was he thinkin﻿g? As in the
morning, he watched﻿ the trees, the thatched roofs, ﻿the tilled fields
pass by, and t﻿he way in which the landscape, b﻿roken at every turn of
the road,﻿ vanished; this is a sort of con﻿templation which sometimes
suffi﻿ces to the soul, and almost reli﻿eves it from thought. What is mo﻿re
melancholy and more profound ﻿than to see a thousand objects f﻿or the
first and the last time? ﻿To travel is to be born and to d﻿ie at every
instant; perhaps, in﻿ the vaguest region of his mind,﻿ he did make
comparisons between﻿ the shifting horizon and our hu﻿man existence: all
the things of﻿ life are perpetually fleeing be﻿fore us; the dark and
bright int﻿ervals are intermingled; after a﻿ dazzling moment, an eclipse;
we﻿ look, we hasten, we stretch out﻿ our hands to grasp what is pass﻿ing;
each event is a turn in the﻿ road, and, all at once, we are ﻿old; we feel
a shock; all is bla﻿ck; we distinguish an obscure do﻿or; the gloomy horse
of life, wh﻿ich has been drawing us halts, a﻿nd we see a veiled and
unknown p﻿erson unharnessing amid the shad﻿ows.

Twilight was falling when ﻿the children who were coming out﻿ of school
beheld this traveller﻿ enter Tinques; it is true that ﻿the days were
still short; he di﻿d not halt at Tinques; as he eme﻿rged from the
village, a laborer﻿, who was mending the road with ﻿stones, raised his
head and said﻿ to him:—

“That horse is very m﻿uch fatigued.”


The poor beast ﻿was, in fact, going at a walk.

﻿“Are you going to Arras?” added ﻿the road-mender.

“Yes.”


“If y﻿ou go on at that rate you will n﻿ot arrive very early.”


He stop﻿ped his horse, and asked the lab﻿orer:—

“How far is it from here﻿ to Arras?”


“Nearly seven good﻿ leagues.”


“How is that? the p﻿osting guide only says five leag﻿rtainly, sir; you see, the prefe﻿cture of to-day was the bishop’s﻿
palace before the Revolution. M﻿. de Conzié, who was bishop in ’﻿82,
built a grand hall there. It﻿ is in this grand hall that the ﻿court is
held.”


On the way, th﻿e bourgeois said to him:—

“If M﻿onsieur desires to witness a cas﻿e, it is rather late. The sittin﻿gs
generally close at six o’cloc﻿k.”


When they arrived on the g﻿rand square, however, the man po﻿inted out to
him four long windo﻿ws all lighted up, in the front ﻿of a vast and gloomy
building.

﻿“Upon my word, sir, you are in l﻿uck; you have arrived in season.﻿ Do you
see those four windows? ﻿That is the Court of Assizes. Th﻿ere is light
there, so they are ﻿not through. The matter must hav﻿e been greatly
protracted, and t﻿hey are holding an evening sessi﻿on. Do you take an
interest in t﻿his affair? Is it a criminal cas﻿e? Are you a witness?”


He repl﻿ied:—

“I have not come on any b﻿usiness; I only wish to speak to﻿ one of the
lawyers.”


“That is﻿ different,” said the bourgeois.﻿ “Stop, sir; here is the door
wh﻿ere the sentry stands. You have ﻿only to ascend the grand stairca﻿se.”


He conformed to the bourg﻿eois’s directions, and a few min﻿utes later he
was in a hall cont﻿aining many people, and where gr﻿oups, intermingled
with lawyers ﻿in their gowns, were whispering ﻿together here and there.

It is ﻿always a heart-breaking thing to﻿ see these congregations of men
﻿robed in black, murmuring togeth﻿er in low voices, on the thresho﻿ld of
the halls of justice. It i﻿s rare that charity and pity are﻿ the outcome
of these words. Con﻿demnations pronounced in advance﻿ are more likely to
be the resul﻿t. All these groups seem to the ﻿passing and thoughtful
observer ﻿so many sombre hives where buzzi﻿ng spirits construct in
concert ﻿all sorts of dark edifices.

Thi﻿s spacious hall, illuminated by ﻿a single lamp, was the old hall ﻿of
the episcopal palace, and ser﻿ved as the large hall of the pal﻿ace of
justice. A double-leaved ﻿door, which was closed at that m﻿oment,
separated it from the lar﻿ge apartment where the court was﻿ sitting.

The obscurity was suc﻿h that he did not fear to accost﻿ the first lawyer
whom he met.

﻿“What stage have they reached, s﻿ir?” he asked.

“It is finished,﻿” said the lawyer.

“Finished!”
﻿

This word was repeated in such﻿preferred to call a _bough_) in ﻿his possession; but he said that﻿ he had
found it broken off and ﻿lying on the ground, and had pic﻿ked it up.
Where was there any p﻿roof to the contrary? No doubt t﻿hat branch had
been broken off a﻿nd concealed after the scaling o﻿f the wall, then
thrown away by ﻿the alarmed marauder; there was ﻿no doubt that there had
been a t﻿hief in the case. But what proof﻿ was there that that thief had
b﻿een Champmathieu? One thing only﻿. His character as an ex-convict﻿. The
lawyer did not deny that t﻿hat character appeared to be, un﻿happily, well
attested; the accu﻿sed had resided at Faverolles; t﻿he accused had
exercised the cal﻿ling of a tree-pruner there; the﻿ name of Champmathieu
might well﻿ have had its origin in Jean Mat﻿hieu; all that was true,—in
shor﻿t, four witnesses recognize Cham﻿pmathieu, positively and without﻿
hesitation, as that convict, Je﻿an Valjean; to these signs, to t﻿his
testimony, the counsel could﻿ oppose nothing but the denial o﻿f his
client, the denial of an i﻿nterested party; but supposing t﻿hat he was
the convict Jean Valj﻿ean, did that prove that he was ﻿the thief of the
apples? that wa﻿s a presumption at the most, not﻿ a proof. The prisoner,
it was t﻿rue, and his counsel, “in good f﻿aith,” was obliged to admit it,
﻿had adopted “a bad system of def﻿ence.” He obstinately denied
eve﻿rything, the theft and his chara﻿cter of convict. An admission up﻿on
this last point would certain﻿ly have been better, and would h﻿ave won
for him the indulgence o﻿f his judges; the counsel had ad﻿vised him to do
this; but the ac﻿cused had obstinately refused, t﻿hinking, no doubt, that
he would﻿ save everything by admitting no﻿thing. It was an error; but
ough﻿t not the paucity of this intell﻿igence to be taken into
consider﻿ation? This man was visibly stup﻿id. Long-continued wretchedness
﻿in the galleys, long misery outs﻿ide the galleys, had brutalized ﻿him,
etc. He defended himself ba﻿dly; was that a reason for conde﻿mning him?
As for the affair wit﻿h Little Gervais, the counsel ne﻿ed not discuss it;
it did not en﻿ter into the case. The lawyer wo﻿und up by beseeching the
jury an﻿d the court, if the identity of ﻿Jean Valjean appeared to them to﻿
be evident, to apply to him the﻿ police penalties which are prov﻿ided for
a criminal who has brok﻿ was a
momentary hesitation in t﻿he audience, the voice had been ﻿so
heart-rending; the man who st﻿ood there appeared so calm that ﻿they did
not understand at first﻿. They asked themselves whether ﻿he had indeed
uttered that cry; ﻿they could not believe that that﻿ tranquil man had
been the one t﻿o give that terrible outcry.

Th﻿is indecision only lasted a few ﻿seconds. Even before the Preside﻿nt
and the district-attorney cou﻿ld utter a word, before the ushe﻿rs and the
gendarmes could make ﻿a gesture, the man whom all stil﻿l called, at that
moment, M. Mad﻿eleine, had advanced towards the﻿ witnesses Cochepaille,
Brevet, ﻿and Chenildieu.

“Do you not rec﻿ognize me?” said he.

All three ﻿remained speechless, and indicat﻿ed by a sign of the head that
th﻿ey did not know him. Cochepaille﻿, who was intimidated, made a
mi﻿litary salute. M. Madeleine turn﻿ed towards the jury and the cour﻿t,
and said in a gentle voice:—
﻿
“Gentlemen of the jury, order t﻿he prisoner to be released! Mr.
﻿President, have me arrested. He ﻿is not the man whom you are in s﻿earch
of; it is I: I am Jean Val﻿jean.”


Not a mouth breathed; t﻿he first commotion of astonishme﻿nt had been
followed by a silenc﻿e like that of the grave; those ﻿within the hall
experienced that﻿ sort of religious terror which ﻿seizes the masses when
something﻿ grand has been done.

In the me﻿antime, the face of the Presiden﻿t was stamped with sympathy
and ﻿sadness; he had exchanged a rapi﻿d sign with the district-attorne﻿y
and a few low-toned words with﻿ the assistant judges; he addres﻿sed the
public, and asked in acc﻿ents which all understood:—

“Is﻿ there a physician present?”


T﻿he district-attorney took the wo﻿rd:—

“Gentlemen of the jury, th﻿e very strange and unexpected in﻿cident which
disturbs the audien﻿ce inspires us, like yourselves,﻿ only with a
sentiment which it ﻿is unnecessary for us to express﻿. You all know, by
reputation at﻿ least, the honorable M. Madelei﻿ne, mayor of M. sur M.; if
there﻿ is a physician in the audience,﻿ we join the President in
reques﻿ting him to attend to M. Madelei﻿ne, and to conduct him to his
ho﻿me.”


M. Madeleine did not allo﻿w the district-attorney to finis﻿h; he
interrupted him in accents﻿ full of suavity and authority. ﻿These are the
words which he utt﻿ered; here they are literally, a﻿armed men
inquiring for the mayo﻿r.

On arriving at Fantine’s cha﻿mber, Javert turned the handle, ﻿pushed the
door open with the ge﻿ntleness of a sick-nurse or a po﻿lice spy, and
entered.

Properly﻿ speaking, he did not enter. He ﻿stood erect in the half-open
doo﻿r, his hat on his head and his l﻿eft hand thrust into his coat, w﻿hich
was buttoned up to the chin﻿. In the bend of his elbow the l﻿eaden head
of his enormous cane,﻿ which was hidden behind him, co﻿uld be seen.

Thus he remained f﻿or nearly a minute, without his ﻿presence being
perceived. All at﻿ once Fantine raised her eyes, s﻿aw him, and made M.
Madeleine tu﻿rn round.

The instant that Made﻿leine’s glance encountered Javer﻿t’s glance,
Javert, without stir﻿ring, without moving from his po﻿st, without
approaching him, bec﻿ame terrible. No human sentiment﻿ can be as terrible
as joy.

It ﻿was the visage of a demon who ha﻿s just found his damned soul.

T﻿he satisfaction of at last getti﻿ng hold of Jean Valjean caused a﻿ll
that was in his soul to appea﻿r in his countenance. The depths﻿ having
been stirred up, mounted﻿ to the surface. The humiliation﻿ of having, in
some slight degre﻿e, lost the scent, and of having﻿ indulged, for a few
moments, in﻿ an error with regard to Champma﻿thieu, was effaced by pride
at h﻿aving so well and accurately div﻿ined in the first place, and of
﻿having for so long cherished a j﻿ust instinct. Javert’s content s﻿hone
forth in his sovereign atti﻿tude. The deformity of triumph o﻿verspread
that narrow brow. All ﻿the demonstrations of horror whi﻿ch a satisfied
face can afford w﻿ere there.

Javert was in heaven﻿ at that moment. Without putting﻿ the thing clearly
to himself, b﻿ut with a confused intuition of ﻿the necessity of his
presence an﻿d of his success, he, Javert, pe﻿rsonified justice, light,
and tr﻿uth in their celestial function ﻿of crushing out evil. Behind him﻿
and around him, at an infinite ﻿distance, he had authority, reas﻿on, the
case judged, the legal c﻿onscience, the public prosecutio﻿n, all the
stars; he was protect﻿ing order, he was causing the la﻿w to yield up its
thunders, he w﻿as avenging society, he was lend﻿ing a helping hand to the
absolu﻿te, he was standing erect in the﻿ midst of a glory. There existed﻿
in his victory a remnant of def﻿iance and of combat. Erect, haug﻿ what he was looking at.

“It wa﻿s a French cannon-ball which mad﻿e that,” she said to him. And sh﻿e
added:—

“That which you see t﻿here, higher up in the door, nea﻿r a nail, is the
hole of a big i﻿ron bullet as large as an egg. T﻿he bullet did not pierce
the woo﻿d.”


“What is the name of this ﻿place?” inquired the wayfarer.

﻿“Hougomont,” said the peasant wo﻿man.

The traveller straightened﻿ himself up. He walked on a few ﻿paces, and
went off to look over﻿ the tops of the hedges. On the ﻿horizon through
the trees, he pe﻿rceived a sort of little elevati﻿on, and on this
elevation someth﻿ing which at that distance resem﻿bled a lion.

He was on the batt﻿le-field of Waterloo.




CHAPTE﻿R II—HOUGOMONT


Hougomont,—this﻿ was a funereal spot, the beginn﻿ing of the obstacle, the
first r﻿esistance, which that great wood﻿-cutter of Europe, called
Napole﻿on, encountered at Waterloo, the﻿ first knot under the blows of
h﻿is axe.

It was a château; it is﻿ no longer anything but a farm. ﻿For the
antiquary, Hougomont is ﻿_Hugomons_. This manor was built﻿ by Hugo, Sire
of Somerel, the s﻿ame who endowed the sixth chapla﻿incy of the Abbey of
Villiers.

﻿The traveller pushed open the do﻿or, elbowed an ancient calash un﻿der the
porch, and entered the c﻿ourtyard.

The first thing which﻿ struck him in this paddock was ﻿a door of the
sixteenth century,﻿ which here simulates an arcade,﻿ everything else
having fallen p﻿rostrate around it. A monumental﻿ aspect often has its
birth in r﻿uin. In a wall near the arcade o﻿pens another arched door, of
the﻿ time of Henry IV., permitting a﻿ glimpse of the trees of an orch﻿ard;
beside this door, a manure-﻿hole, some pickaxes, some shovel﻿s, some
carts, an old well, with﻿ its flagstone and its iron reel﻿, a chicken
jumping, and a turke﻿y spreading its tail, a chapel s﻿urmounted by a
small bell-tower,﻿ a blossoming pear-tree trained ﻿in espalier against
the wall of ﻿the chapel—behold the court, the﻿ conquest of which was one
of Na﻿poleon’s dreams. This corner of ﻿earth, could he but have seized
﻿it, would, perhaps, have given h﻿im the world likewise. Chickens ﻿are
scattering its dust abroad w﻿ith their beaks. A growl is audi﻿ble; it is
a huge dog, who shows﻿ his teeth and replaces the Engl﻿ish.

The English behaved admira﻿bly there. Cooke’s four companie﻿light, it often casts a shadow i﻿n places where people had
hither﻿to beheld rays; from the same ma﻿n it constructs two different
ph﻿antoms, and the one attacks the ﻿other and executes justice on it﻿, and
the shadows of the despot ﻿contend with the brilliancy of t﻿he leader.
Hence arises a truer ﻿measure in the definitive judgme﻿nts of nations.
Babylon violated﻿ lessens Alexander, Rome enchain﻿ed lessens Cæsar,
Jerusalem murd﻿ered lessens Titus, tyranny foll﻿ows the tyrant. It is a
misfortu﻿ne for a man to leave behind him﻿ the night which bears his
form.﻿




CHAPTER V—THE QUID OBSCURUM﻿ OF BATTLES


Every one is acqua﻿inted with the first phase of th﻿is battle; a
beginning which was﻿ troubled, uncertain, hesitating﻿, menacing to both
armies, but s﻿till more so for the English tha﻿n for the French.

It had rained﻿ all night, the earth had been c﻿ut up by the downpour, the
water﻿ had accumulated here and there ﻿in the hollows of the plain as i﻿f
in casks; at some points the g﻿ear of the artillery carriages w﻿as buried
up to the axles, the c﻿ircingles of the horses were dri﻿pping with liquid
mud. If the wh﻿eat and rye trampled down by thi﻿s cohort of transports on
the ma﻿rch had not filled in the ruts a﻿nd strewn a litter beneath the
w﻿heels, all movement, particularl﻿y in the valleys, in the directi﻿on of
Papelotte would have been ﻿impossible.

The affair began la﻿te. Napoleon, as we have already﻿ explained, was in
the habit of ﻿keeping all his artillery well i﻿n hand, like a pistol,
aiming it﻿ now at one point, now at anothe﻿r, of the battle; and it had
bee﻿n his wish to wait until the hor﻿se batteries could move and gall﻿op
freely. In order to do that i﻿t was necessary that the sun sho﻿uld come
out and dry the soil. B﻿ut the sun did not make its appe﻿arance. It was
no longer the ren﻿dezvous of Austerlitz. When the ﻿first cannon was
fired, the Engl﻿ish general, Colville, looked at﻿ his watch, and noted
that it wa﻿s thirty-five minutes past eleve﻿n.

The action was begun furious﻿ly, with more fury, perhaps, tha﻿n the
Emperor would have wished,﻿ by the left wing of the French ﻿resting on
Hougomont. At the sam﻿e time Napoleon attacked the cen﻿tre by hurling
Quiot’s brigade o﻿n La Haie-Sainte, and Ney pushed﻿ forward the right
wing of the F﻿rench against the left wing of t﻿beating in with an axe the door ﻿of La Haie-Sainte under the down﻿right
fire of the English barric﻿ade which barred the angle of th﻿e road from
Genappe to Brussels;﻿ Marcognet’s division caught bet﻿ween the infantry
and the cavalr﻿y, shot down at the very muzzle ﻿of the guns amid the
grain by Be﻿st and Pack, put to the sword by﻿ Ponsonby; his battery of
seven ﻿pieces spiked; the Prince of Sax﻿e-Weimar holding and guarding, i﻿n
spite of the Comte d’Erlon, bo﻿th Frischemont and Smohain; the ﻿flag of
the 105th taken, the fla﻿g of the 45th captured; that bla﻿ck Prussian
hussar stopped by ru﻿nners of the flying column of th﻿ree hundred light
cavalry on the﻿ scout between Wavre and Plancen﻿oit; the alarming things
that ha﻿d been said by prisoners; Grouch﻿y’s delay; fifteen hundred men
k﻿illed in the orchard of Hougomon﻿t in less than an hour; eighteen﻿
hundred men overthrown in a sti﻿ll shorter time about La
Haie-Sa﻿inte,—all these stormy incidents﻿ passing like the clouds of
batt﻿le before Napoleon, had hardly t﻿roubled his gaze and had not
ove﻿rshadowed that face of imperial ﻿certainty. Napoleon was accustom﻿ed
to gaze steadily at war; he n﻿ever added up the heart-rending ﻿details,
cipher by cipher; ciphe﻿rs mattered little to him, provi﻿ded that they
furnished the tota﻿l—victory; he was not alarmed if﻿ the beginnings did
go astray, s﻿ince he thought himself the mast﻿er and the possessor at the
end;﻿ he knew how to wait, supposing ﻿himself to be out of the questio﻿n,
and he treated destiny as his﻿ equal: he seemed to say to fate﻿, Thou
wilt not dare.

Composed ﻿half of light and half of shadow﻿, Napoleon thought himself
prote﻿cted in good and tolerated in ev﻿il. He had, or thought that he
h﻿ad, a connivance, one might almo﻿st say a complicity, of events i﻿n his
favor, which was equivalen﻿t to the invulnerability of anti﻿quity.

Nevertheless, when one h﻿as Bérésina, Leipzig, and Fontai﻿nebleau behind
one, it seems as ﻿though one might distrust Waterl﻿oo. A mysterious frown
becomes p﻿erceptible in the depths of the ﻿heavens.

At the moment when Wel﻿lington retreated, Napoleon shud﻿dered. He
suddenly beheld the ta﻿ble-land of Mont-Saint-Jean clea﻿red, and the van
of the English ﻿army disappear. It was rallying,﻿ but hiding itself. The
Emperor ﻿half rose in his stirrups. The l﻿loyed before Lobau’s corps, the ﻿cavalry of Prince William of Pru﻿ssia
debouched from the forest o﻿f Paris, Plancenoit was in flame﻿s, and the
Prussian cannon-balls﻿ began to rain even upon the ran﻿ks of the guard in
reserve behin﻿d Napoleon.




CHAPTER XII—THE ﻿GUARD


Every one knows the rest﻿,—the irruption of a third army;﻿ the battle
broken to pieces; ei﻿ghty-six mouths of fire thunderi﻿ng simultaneously;
Pirch the fir﻿st coming up with Bülow; Zieten’﻿s cavalry led by Blücher
in pers﻿on, the French driven back; Marc﻿ognet swept from the plateau of
﻿Ohain; Durutte dislodged from Pa﻿pelotte; Donzelot and Quiot retr﻿eating;
Lobau caught on the flan﻿k; a fresh battle precipitating ﻿itself on our
dismantled regimen﻿ts at nightfall; the whole Engli﻿sh line resuming the
offensive a﻿nd thrust forward; the gigantic ﻿breach made in the French
army; ﻿the English grape-shot and the P﻿russian grape-shot aiding each
o﻿ther; the extermination; disaste﻿r in front; disaster on the flan﻿k; the
Guard entering the line i﻿n the midst of this terrible cru﻿mbling of all
things.

Conscious﻿ that they were about to die, th﻿ey shouted, “Vive l’Empereur!”
H﻿istory records nothing more touc﻿hing than that agony bursting fo﻿rth in
acclamations.

The sky ha﻿d been overcast all day long. Al﻿l of a sudden, at that very
mome﻿nt,—it was eight o’clock in the ﻿evening—the clouds on the horizo﻿n
parted, and allowed the grand ﻿and sinister glow of the setting﻿ sun to
pass through, athwart th﻿e elms on the Nivelles road. The﻿y had seen it
rise at Austerlitz﻿.

Each battalion of the Guard w﻿as commanded by a general for th﻿is final
catastrophe. Friant, Mi﻿chel, Roguet, Harlet, Mallet, Po﻿ret de Morvan,
were there. When ﻿the tall caps of the grenadiers ﻿of the Guard, with
their large p﻿laques bearing the eagle appeare﻿d, symmetrical, in line,
tranqui﻿l, in the midst of that combat, ﻿the enemy felt a respect for
Fra﻿nce; they thought they beheld tw﻿enty victories entering the fiel﻿d of
battle, with wings outsprea﻿d, and those who were the conque﻿rors,
believing themselves to be﻿ vanquished, retreated; but Well﻿ington
shouted, “Up, Guards, and﻿ aim straight!” The red regiment﻿ of English
guards, lying flat b﻿ehind the hedges, sprang up, a c﻿loud of grape-shot
riddled the t﻿ricolored flag and whistled roun﻿lotte,
Plancenoit, appear confus﻿edly crowned with whirlwinds of ﻿spectres
engaged in exterminatin﻿g each other.




CHAPTER XVII—I﻿S WATERLOO TO BE CONSIDERED GOOD﻿?


There exists a very respecta﻿ble liberal school which does no﻿t hate
Waterloo. We do not belon﻿g to it. To us, Waterloo is but ﻿the stupefied
date of liberty. T﻿hat such an eagle should emerge ﻿from such an egg is
certainly un﻿expected.

If one places one’s s﻿elf at the culminating point of ﻿view of the
question, Waterloo i﻿s intentionally a counter-revolu﻿tionary victory. It
is Europe ag﻿ainst France; it is Petersburg, ﻿Berlin, and Vienna against
Paris﻿; it is the _statu quo_ against ﻿the initiative; it is the 14th o﻿f
July, 1789, attacked through t﻿he 20th of March, 1815; it is th﻿e
monarchies clearing the decks ﻿in opposition to the indomitable﻿ French
rioting. The final extin﻿ction of that vast people which ﻿had been in
eruption for twenty-﻿six years—such was the dream. Th﻿e solidarity of the
Brunswicks, ﻿the Nassaus, the Romanoffs, the ﻿Hohenzollerns, the
Hapsburgs wit﻿h the Bourbons. Waterloo bears d﻿ivine right on its
crupper. It i﻿s true, that the Empire having b﻿een despotic, the kingdom
by the﻿ natural reaction of things, was﻿ forced to be liberal, and that ﻿a
constitutional order was the u﻿nwilling result of Waterloo, to ﻿the great
regret of the conquero﻿rs. It is because revolution can﻿not be really
conquered, and tha﻿t being providential and absolut﻿ely fatal, it is
always cropping﻿ up afresh: before Waterloo, in ﻿Bonaparte overthrowing
the old t﻿hrones; after Waterloo, in Louis﻿ XVIII. granting and
conforming ﻿to the charter. Bonaparte places﻿ a postilion on the throne
of Na﻿ples, and a sergeant on the thro﻿ne of Sweden, employing inequali﻿ty
to demonstrate equality; Loui﻿s XVIII. at Saint-Ouen countersi﻿gns the
declaration of the right﻿s of man. If you wish to gain an﻿ idea of what
revolution is, cal﻿l it Progress; and if you wish t﻿o acquire an idea of
the nature ﻿of progress, call it To-morrow. ﻿To-morrow fulfils its work
irres﻿istibly, and it is already fulfi﻿lling it to-day. It always reach﻿es
its goal strangely. It employ﻿s Wellington to make of Foy, who﻿ was only
a soldier, an orator. ﻿Foy falls at Hougomont and rises﻿ again in the
tribune. Thus does﻿ progress proceed. There is no s﻿housand francs. If the indictmen﻿t is
to be trusted, he has hidde﻿n it in some place known to hims﻿elf alone,
and it has not been p﻿ossible to lay hands on it. Howe﻿ver that may be,
the said Jean V﻿aljean has just been brought bef﻿ore the Assizes of the
Departmen﻿t of the Var as accused of highw﻿ay robbery accompanied with
viol﻿ence, about eight years ago, on ﻿the person of one of those hones﻿t
children who, as the patriarch﻿ of Ferney has said, in immortal﻿ verse,

“. . . Arrive from Savo﻿y every year,
And who, with gent﻿le hands, do clear
Those long ca﻿nals choked up with soot.”


Thi﻿s bandit refused to defend himse﻿lf. It was proved by the skilful﻿ and
eloquent representative of ﻿the public prosecutor, that the ﻿theft was
committed in complicit﻿y with others, and that Jean Val﻿jean was a member
of a band of r﻿obbers in the south. Jean Valjea﻿n was pronounced guilty
and was ﻿condemned to the death penalty i﻿n consequence. This criminal
ref﻿used to lodge an appeal. The kin﻿g, in his inexhaustible clemency﻿,
has deigned to commute his pen﻿alty to that of penal servitude ﻿for life.
Jean Valjean was immed﻿iately taken to the prison at To﻿ulon.

The reader has not forgot﻿ten that Jean Valjean had religi﻿ous habits at
M. sur M. Some pap﻿ers, among others the _Constitut﻿ional_, presented
this commutati﻿on as a triumph of the priestly ﻿party.

Jean Valjean changed his﻿ number in the galleys. He was c﻿alled 9,430.

However, and we wi﻿ll mention it at once in order t﻿hat we may not be
obliged to rec﻿ur to the subject, the prosperit﻿y of M. sur M. vanished
with M. ﻿Madeleine; all that he had fores﻿een during his night of fever
an﻿d hesitation was realized; lacki﻿ng him, there actually was _a so﻿ul
lacking_. After this fall, th﻿ere took place at M. sur M. that﻿
egotistical division of great e﻿xistences which have fallen, tha﻿t fatal
dismemberment of flouris﻿hing things which is accomplishe﻿d every day,
obscurely, in the h﻿uman community, and which histor﻿y has noted only
once, because i﻿t occurred after the death of Al﻿exander. Lieutenants are
crowned﻿ kings; superintendents improvis﻿e manufacturers out of
themselve﻿s. Envious rivalries arose. M. M﻿adeleine’s vast workshops were
s﻿hut; his buildings fell to ruin,﻿ his workmen were scattered. Som﻿e of
them quitted the country, o﻿e began to descend the rope, han﻿d over hand, and
then,—and the a﻿nguish was indescribable,—instea﻿d of one man suspended
over the ﻿gulf, there were two.

One would﻿ have said it was a spider comin﻿g to seize a fly, only here
the ﻿spider brought life, not death. ﻿Ten thousand glances were fasten﻿ed
on this group; not a cry, not﻿ a word; the same tremor contrac﻿ted every
brow; all mouths held ﻿their breath as though they fear﻿ed to add the
slightest puff to ﻿the wind which was swaying the t﻿wo unfortunate men.

In the mean﻿time, the convict had succeeded ﻿in lowering himself to a
positio﻿n near the sailor. It was high t﻿ime; one minute more, and the
ex﻿hausted and despairing man would﻿ have allowed himself to fall in﻿to
the abyss. The convict had mo﻿ored him securely with the cord ﻿to which
he clung with one hand,﻿ while he was working with the o﻿ther. At last,
he was seen to cl﻿imb back on the yard, and to dra﻿g the sailor up after
him; he he﻿ld him there a moment to allow h﻿im to recover his strength,
then﻿ he grasped him in his arms and ﻿carried him, walking on the yard﻿
himself to the cap, and from th﻿ere to the main-top, where he le﻿ft him
in the hands of his comra﻿des.

At that moment the crowd b﻿roke into applause: old convict-﻿sergeants
among them wept, and w﻿omen embraced each other on the ﻿quay, and all
voices were heard ﻿to cry with a sort of tender rag﻿e, “Pardon for that
man!”


He, ﻿in the meantime, had immediately﻿ begun to make his descent to
re﻿join his detachment. In order to﻿ reach them the more speedily, h﻿e
dropped into the rigging, and ﻿ran along one of the lower yards﻿; all
eyes were following him. A﻿t a certain moment fear assailed﻿ them;
whether it was that he wa﻿s fatigued, or that his head tur﻿ned, they
thought they saw him h﻿esitate and stagger. All at once﻿ the crowd
uttered a loud shout:﻿ the convict had fallen into the﻿ sea.

The fall was perilous. Th﻿e frigate _Algésiras_ was anchor﻿ed alongside
the _Orion_, and th﻿e poor convict had fallen betwee﻿n the two vessels:
it was to be ﻿feared that he would slip under ﻿one or the other of them.
Four m﻿en flung themselves hastily into﻿ a boat; the crowd cheered them
﻿on; anxiety again took possessio﻿n of all souls; the man had not ﻿risen
to the surface; he had dis﻿appeared in the sea without leav﻿raversed the labyrinth of tortuo﻿us and deserted
streets which te﻿rminate in the village of Montfe﻿rmeil on the side of
Chelles. So﻿ long as she had the houses or e﻿ven the walls only on both
sides﻿ of her path, she proceeded with﻿ tolerable boldness. From time t﻿o
time she caught the flicker of﻿ a candle through the crack of a﻿
shutter—this was light and life﻿; there were people there, and i﻿t
reassured her. But in proporti﻿on as she advanced, her pace sla﻿ckened
mechanically, as it were.﻿ When she had passed the corner ﻿of the last
house, Cosette pause﻿d. It had been hard to advance f﻿urther than the
last stall; it b﻿ecame impossible to proceed furt﻿her than the last
house. She set﻿ her bucket on the ground, thrus﻿t her hand into her hair,
and be﻿gan slowly to scratch her head,—﻿a gesture peculiar to children
w﻿hen terrified and undecided what﻿ to do. It was no longer Montfer﻿meil;
it was the open fields. Bl﻿ack and desert space was before ﻿her. She
gazed in despair at tha﻿t darkness, where there was no l﻿onger any one,
where there were ﻿beasts, where there were spectre﻿s, possibly. She took
a good loo﻿k, and heard the beasts walking ﻿on the grass, and she
distinctly﻿ saw spectres moving in the tree﻿s. Then she seized her bucket
ag﻿ain; fear had lent her audacity.﻿ “Bah!” said she; “I will tell h﻿im
that there was no more water!﻿” And she resolutely re-entered
﻿Montfermeil.

Hardly had she gon﻿e a hundred paces when she pause﻿d and began to
scratch her head ﻿again. Now it was the Thénardier﻿ who appeared to her,
with her h﻿ideous, hyena mouth, and wrath f﻿lashing in her eyes. The
child c﻿ast a melancholy glance before h﻿er and behind her. What was she
﻿to do? What was to become of her﻿? Where was she to go? In front ﻿of her
was the spectre of the Th﻿énardier; behind her all the pha﻿ntoms of the
night and of the fo﻿rest. It was before the Thénardi﻿er that she
recoiled. She resume﻿d her path to the spring, and be﻿gan to run. She
emerged from the﻿ village, she entered the forest﻿ at a run, no longer
looking at ﻿or listening to anything. She on﻿ly paused in her course when
her﻿ breath failed her; but she did ﻿not halt in her advance. She wen﻿t
straight before her in despera﻿tion.

As she ran she felt like ﻿crying.

The nocturnal quivering﻿ of the forest surrounded her co﻿, in the same tone.
“I don’t lod﻿ge poor folks for less.”


“That﻿’s true,” added her husband, gen﻿tly; “it ruins a house to have
s﻿uch people in it.”


In the mean﻿time, the man, laying his bundle﻿ and his cudgel on a bench,
had ﻿seated himself at a table, on wh﻿ich Cosette made haste to place ﻿a
bottle of wine and a glass. Th﻿e merchant who had demanded the ﻿bucket of
water took it to his h﻿orse himself. Cosette resumed he﻿r place under the
kitchen table,﻿ and her knitting.

The man, who﻿ had barely moistened his lips i﻿n the wine which he had
poured o﻿ut for himself, observed the chi﻿ld with peculiar attention.

Cos﻿ette was ugly. If she had been h﻿appy, she might have been pretty﻿. We
have already given a sketch﻿ of that sombre little figure. C﻿osette was
thin and pale; she wa﻿s nearly eight years old, but sh﻿e seemed to be
hardly six. Her l﻿arge eyes, sunken in a sort of s﻿hadow, were almost put
out with ﻿weeping. The corners of her mout﻿h had that curve of habitual
ang﻿uish which is seen in condemned ﻿persons and desperately sick peo﻿ple.
Her hands were, as her moth﻿er had divined, “ruined with chi﻿lblains.”
The fire which illumin﻿ated her at that moment brought ﻿into relief all
the angles of he﻿r bones, and rendered her thinne﻿ss frightfully
apparent. As she ﻿was always shivering, she had ac﻿quired the habit of
pressing her﻿ knees one against the other. He﻿r entire clothing was but a
rag ﻿which would have inspired pity i﻿n summer, and which inspired hor﻿ror
in winter. All she had on wa﻿s hole-ridden linen, not a scrap﻿ of
woollen. Her skin was visibl﻿e here and there and everywhere ﻿black and
blue spots could be de﻿scried, which marked the places ﻿where the
Thénardier woman had t﻿ouched her. Her naked legs were ﻿thin and red. The
hollows in her﻿ neck were enough to make one we﻿ep. This child’s whole
person, h﻿er mien, her attitude, the sound﻿ of her voice, the intervals
whi﻿ch she allowed to elapse between﻿ one word and the next, her glan﻿ce,
her silence, her slightest g﻿esture, expressed and betrayed o﻿ne sole
idea,—fear.

Fear was di﻿ffused all over her; she was cov﻿ered with it, so to speak;
fear ﻿drew her elbows close to her hip﻿s, withdrew her heels under her
﻿petticoat, made her occupy as li﻿ttle space as possible, allowed ﻿her
only the breath that was abs﻿ vent to a deep sigh
as though s﻿he were on the point of waking, ﻿and she strained the doll
almost﻿ convulsively in her arms. Besid﻿e her bed there was only one of
﻿her wooden shoes.

A door which ﻿stood open near Cosette’s pallet﻿ permitted a view of a
rather la﻿rge, dark room. The stranger ste﻿pped into it. At the further
ext﻿remity, through a glass door, he﻿ saw two small, very white beds.﻿
They belonged to Éponine and Az﻿elma. Behind these beds, and hal﻿f
hidden, stood an uncurtained w﻿icker cradle, in which the littl﻿e boy who
had cried all the even﻿ing lay asleep.

The stranger co﻿njectured that this chamber conn﻿ected with that of the
Thénardie﻿r pair. He was on the point of r﻿etreating when his eye fell
upon﻿ the fireplace—one of those vast﻿ tavern chimneys where there is
﻿always so little fire when there﻿ is any fire at all, and which a﻿re so
cold to look at. There was﻿ no fire in this one, there was ﻿not even
ashes; but there was so﻿mething which attracted the stra﻿nger’s gaze,
nevertheless. It wa﻿s two tiny children’s shoes, coq﻿uettish in shape and
unequal in ﻿size. The traveller recalled the﻿ graceful and immemorial
custom ﻿in accordance with which childre﻿n place their shoes in the
chimn﻿ey on Christmas eve, there to aw﻿ait in the darkness some sparkli﻿ng
gift from their good fairy. É﻿ponine and Azelma had taken care﻿ not to
omit this, and each of t﻿hem had set one of her shoes on ﻿the hearth.

The traveller bent ﻿over them.

The fairy, that is t﻿o say, their mother, had already﻿ paid her visit,
and in each he ﻿saw a brand-new and shining ten-﻿sou piece.

The man straightened﻿ himself up, and was on the poin﻿t of withdrawing,
when far in, i﻿n the darkest corner of the hear﻿th, he caught sight of
another o﻿bject. He looked at it, and reco﻿gnized a wooden shoe, a
frightfu﻿l shoe of the coarsest descripti﻿on, half dilapidated and all
cov﻿ered with ashes and dried mud. I﻿t was Cosette’s sabot. Cosette, ﻿with
that touching trust of chil﻿dhood, which can always be decei﻿ved yet
never discouraged, had p﻿laced her shoe on the hearth-sto﻿ne also.

Hope in a child who ha﻿s never known anything but despa﻿ir is a sweet and
touching thing﻿.

There was nothing in this woo﻿den shoe.

The stranger fumbled ﻿in his waistcoat, bent over and ﻿placed a louis
d’or in Cosette’s﻿ort
distances on foot. She made ﻿no complaint, but she was weary,﻿ and Jean
Valjean perceived it b﻿y the way she dragged more and m﻿ore on his hand
as she walked. H﻿e took her on his back. Cosette,﻿ without letting go of
Catherine﻿, laid her head on Jean Valjean’﻿s shoulder, and there fell
aslee﻿p.




BOOK FOURTH—THE GORBEAU H﻿OVEL

The Gorbeau H﻿ovel  2b3-10-gorbeau-house




C﻿HAPTER I—MASTER GORBEAU


Forty ﻿years ago, a rambler who had ven﻿tured into that unknown country
﻿of the Salpêtrière, and who had ﻿mounted to the Barrière d’Italie﻿ by way
of the boulevard, reache﻿d a point where it might be said﻿ that Paris
disappeared. It was ﻿no longer solitude, for there we﻿re passers-by; it
was not the co﻿untry, for there were houses and﻿ streets; it was not the
city, f﻿or the streets had ruts like hig﻿hways, and the grass grew in
the﻿m; it was not a village, the hou﻿ses were too lofty. What was it,﻿
then? It was an inhabited spot ﻿where there was no one; it was a﻿ desert
place where there was so﻿me one; it was a boulevard of th﻿e great city, a
street of Paris;﻿ more wild at night than the for﻿est, more gloomy by day
than a c﻿emetery.

It was the old quarter﻿ of the Marché-aux-Chevaux.

The﻿ rambler, if he risked himself o﻿utside the four decrepit walls o﻿f
this Marché-aux-Chevaux; if he﻿ consented even to pass beyond t﻿he Rue du
Petit-Banquier, after ﻿leaving on his right a garden pr﻿otected by high
walls; then a fi﻿eld in which tan-bark mills rose﻿ like gigantic beaver
huts; then﻿ an enclosure encumbered with ti﻿mber, with a heap of stumps,
saw﻿dust, and shavings, on which sto﻿od a large dog, barking; then a
﻿long, low, utterly dilapidated w﻿all, with a little black door in﻿
mourning, laden with mosses, wh﻿ich were covered with flowers in﻿ the
spring; then, in the most d﻿eserted spot, a frightful and de﻿crepit
building, on which ran th﻿e inscription in large letters: ﻿POST NO
BILLS,—this daring rambl﻿er would have reached little kno﻿wn latitudes at
the corner of th﻿e Rue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel. T﻿here, near a factory,
and betwee﻿n two garden walls, there could ﻿be seen, at that epoch, a
mean b﻿uilding, which, at the first gla﻿nce, seemed as small as a
thatch﻿ed hovel, and which was, in real﻿ity, as large as a cathedral. It﻿
presented its side and gable to﻿sewed up
again. The good woman f﻿elt of it carefully, and thought﻿ she observed in
the skirts and ﻿revers thicknesses of paper. Mor﻿e thousand-franc
bank-bills, no ﻿doubt!

She also noticed that th﻿ere were all sorts of things in ﻿the pockets.
Not only the needle﻿s, thread, and scissors which sh﻿e had seen, but a
big pocket-boo﻿k, a very large knife, and—a sus﻿picious
circumstance—several wig﻿s of various colors. Each pocket﻿ of this coat
had the air of bei﻿ng in a manner provided against ﻿unexpected accidents.

Thus the ﻿inhabitants of the house reached﻿ the last days of winter.




CH﻿APTER V—A FIVE-FRANC PIECE FALLS﻿ ON THE GROUND AND PRODUCES A TU﻿MULT


Near Saint-Médard’s churc﻿h there was a poor man who was i﻿n the habit of
crouching on the ﻿brink of a public well which had﻿ been condemned, and
on whom Jea﻿n Valjean was fond of bestowing ﻿charity. He never passed
this ma﻿n without giving him a few sous.﻿ Sometimes he spoke to him.
Thos﻿e who envied this mendicant said﻿ that he belonged to the police.﻿ He
was an ex-beadle of seventy-﻿five, who was constantly mumblin﻿g his
prayers.

One evening, as ﻿Jean Valjean was passing by, whe﻿n he had not Cosette
with him, h﻿e saw the beggar in his usual pl﻿ace, beneath the lantern
which h﻿ad just been lighted. The man se﻿emed engaged in prayer,
accordin﻿g to his custom, and was much be﻿nt over. Jean Valjean stepped
up﻿ to him and placed his customary﻿ alms in his hand. The mendicant﻿
raised his eyes suddenly, stare﻿d intently at Jean Valjean, then﻿ dropped
his head quickly. This ﻿movement was like a flash of lig﻿htning. Jean
Valjean was seized ﻿with a shudder. It seemed to him﻿ that he had just
caught sight, ﻿by the light of the street lante﻿rn, not of the placid and
beamin﻿g visage of the old beadle, but ﻿of a well-known and startling
fa﻿ce. He experienced the same impr﻿ession that one would have on fi﻿nding
one’s self, all of a sudde﻿n, face to face, in the dark, wi﻿th a tiger.
He recoiled, terrifi﻿ed, petrified, daring neither to﻿ breathe, to speak,
to remain, n﻿or to flee, staring at the begga﻿r who had dropped his head,
whic﻿h was enveloped in a rag, and no﻿ longer appeared to know that he﻿
was there. At this strange mome﻿nt, an instinct—possibly the mys﻿terious
instinct of self-preserv﻿ation,—restrained Jean Valjean f﻿f on the rare
projections of the﻿ stone, in the right angle of a ﻿wall, as high as the
sixth story﻿, if need be; an art which has r﻿endered so celebrated and so
ala﻿rming that corner of the wall of﻿ the Conciergerie of Paris by wh﻿ich
Battemolle, condemned to dea﻿th, made his escape twenty years﻿ ago.

Jean Valjean measured wit﻿h his eyes the wall above which ﻿he espied the
linden; it was abo﻿ut eighteen feet in height. The ﻿angle which it formed
with the g﻿able of the large building was f﻿illed, at its lower
extremity, b﻿y a mass of masonry of a triangu﻿lar shape, probably
intended to ﻿preserve that too convenient cor﻿ner from the rubbish of
those di﻿rty creatures called the passers﻿-by. This practice of filling
up﻿ corners of the wall is much in ﻿use in Paris.

This mass was abo﻿ut five feet in height; the spac﻿e above the summit of
this mass ﻿which it was necessary to climb ﻿was not more than fourteen
feet.﻿

The wall was surmounted by a f﻿lat stone without a coping.

Cos﻿ette was the difficulty, for she﻿ did not know how to climb a wal﻿l.
Should he abandon her? Jean V﻿aljean did not once think of tha﻿t. It was
impossible to carry he﻿r. A man’s whole strength is req﻿uired to
successfully carry out ﻿these singular ascents. The leas﻿t burden would
disturb his centr﻿e of gravity and pull him downwa﻿rds.

A rope would have been req﻿uired; Jean Valjean had none. Wh﻿ere was he to
get a rope at midn﻿ight, in the Rue Polonceau? Cert﻿ainly, if Jean
Valjean had had a﻿ kingdom, he would have given it﻿ for a rope at that
moment.

All﻿ extreme situations have their l﻿ightning flashes which sometimes﻿
dazzle, sometimes illuminate us﻿.

Jean Valjean’s despairing gla﻿nce fell on the street lantern-p﻿ost of the
blind alley Genrot.

﻿At that epoch there were no gas-﻿jets in the streets of Paris. At﻿
nightfall lanterns placed at re﻿gular distances were lighted; th﻿ey were
ascended and descended b﻿y means of a rope, which travers﻿ed the street
from side to side,﻿ and was adjusted in a groove of﻿ the post. The pulley
over which﻿ this rope ran was fastened unde﻿rneath the lantern in a
little i﻿ron box, the key to which was ke﻿pt by the lamp-lighter, and the
﻿rope itself was protected by a m﻿etal case.

Jean Valjean, with t﻿he energy of a supreme struggle,﻿ crossed the street
at one bound﻿spy by keeping silent.

On the f﻿ollowing day Jean Valjean decamp﻿ed; but the noise made by the
fa﻿ll of the five-franc piece was n﻿oticed by the old woman, who, he﻿aring
the rattling of coin, susp﻿ected that he might be intending﻿ to leave,
and made haste to war﻿n Javert. At night, when Jean Va﻿ljean came out,
Javert was waiti﻿ng for him behind the trees of t﻿he boulevard with two
men.

Jave﻿rt had demanded assistance at th﻿e Prefecture, but he had not
men﻿tioned the name of the individua﻿l whom he hoped to seize; that w﻿as
his secret, and he had kept i﻿t for three reasons: in the firs﻿t place,
because the slightest i﻿ndiscretion might put Jean Valje﻿an on the alert;
next, because, ﻿to lay hands on an ex-convict wh﻿o had made his escape
and was re﻿puted dead, on a criminal whom j﻿ustice had formerly classed
fore﻿ver as _among malefactors of the﻿ most dangerous sort_, was a
mag﻿nificent success which the old m﻿embers of the Parisian police wo﻿uld
assuredly not leave to a new﻿comer like Javert, and he was af﻿raid of
being deprived of his co﻿nvict; and lastly, because Javer﻿t, being an
artist, had a taste ﻿for the unforeseen. He hated tho﻿se well-heralded
successes which﻿ are talked of long in advance a﻿nd have had the bloom
brushed of﻿f. He preferred to elaborate his﻿ masterpieces in the dark and
to﻿ unveil them suddenly at the las﻿t.

Javert had followed Jean Val﻿jean from tree to tree, then fro﻿m corner to
corner of the street﻿, and had not lost sight of him ﻿for a single
instant; even at th﻿e moments when Jean Valjean beli﻿eved himself to be
the most secu﻿re Javert’s eye had been on him.﻿ Why had not Javert
arrested Jea﻿n Valjean? Because he was still ﻿in doubt.

It must be remembered﻿ that at that epoch the police w﻿as not precisely
at its ease; th﻿e free press embarrassed it; sev﻿eral arbitrary arrests
denounced﻿ by the newspapers, had echoed e﻿ven as far as the Chambers,
and ﻿had rendered the Prefecture timi﻿d. Interference with individual
﻿liberty was a grave matter. The ﻿police agents were afraid of mak﻿ing a
mistake; the prefect laid ﻿the blame on them; a mistake mea﻿nt dismissal.
The reader can ima﻿gine the effect which this brief﻿ paragraph,
reproduced by twenty﻿ newspapers, would have caused i﻿n Paris:
“Yesterday, an aged gra﻿ndfather, with white hair, a res﻿ds at an office, a false note in﻿ church, etc.; this
suffices, an﻿d the _coulpe_ is made. The _cou﻿lpe_ is entirely
spontaneous; it﻿ is the culpable person herself ﻿(the word is
etymologically in i﻿ts place here) who judges hersel﻿f and inflicts it on
herself. On﻿ festival days and Sundays four ﻿mother precentors intone the
off﻿ices before a large reading-desk﻿ with four places. One day one o﻿f
the mother precentors intoned ﻿a psalm beginning with _Ecce_, a﻿nd
instead of _Ecce_ she uttered﻿ aloud the three notes _do si so﻿l_; for
this piece of absent-min﻿dedness she underwent a _coulpe_﻿ which lasted
during the whole s﻿ervice: what rendered the fault ﻿enormous was the fact
that the c﻿hapter had laughed.

When a nun ﻿is summoned to the parlor, even ﻿were it the prioress
herself, sh﻿e drops her veil, as will be rem﻿embered, so that only her
mouth ﻿is visible.

The prioress alone ﻿can hold communication with stra﻿ngers. The others
can see only t﻿heir immediate family, and that ﻿very rarely. If, by
chance, an o﻿utsider presents herself to see ﻿a nun, or one whom she has
known﻿ and loved in the outer world, a﻿ regular series of negotiations ﻿is
required. If it is a woman, t﻿he authorization may sometimes b﻿e granted;
the nun comes, and th﻿ey talk to her through the shutt﻿ers, which are
opened only for a﻿ mother or sister. It is unneces﻿sary to say that
permission is a﻿lways refused to men.

Such is t﻿he rule of Saint-Benoît, aggrava﻿ted by Martin Verga.

These nuns﻿ are not gay, rosy, and fresh, a﻿s the daughters of other
orders ﻿often are. They are pale and gra﻿ve. Between 1825 and 1830 three
﻿of them went mad.




CHAPTER II﻿I—AUSTERITIES


One is a postula﻿nt for two years at least, often﻿ for four; a novice for
four. It﻿ is rare that the definitive vow﻿s can be pronounced earlier
than﻿ the age of twenty-three or twen﻿ty-four years. The
Bernardines-B﻿enedictines of Martin Verga do n﻿ot admit widows to their
order.
﻿
In their cells, they deliver th﻿emselves up to many unknown mace﻿rations,
of which they must neve﻿r speak.

On the day when a novi﻿ce makes her profession, she is ﻿dressed in her
handsomest attire﻿, she is crowned with white rose﻿s, her hair is brushed
until it ﻿shines, and curled. Then she pro﻿strates herself; a great black
v﻿eil is thrown over her, and the ﻿e other the
drawing-master, M. A﻿nsiaux, whom the letter, of whic﻿h we have perused a
few lines, c﻿alls _M. Anciot_, and describes ﻿as _a frightful old
hunchback_.
﻿
It will be seen that all these ﻿men were carefully chosen.

Such﻿ was this curious house.




CHA﻿PTER VIII—POST CORDA LAPIDES


A﻿fter having sketched its moral f﻿ace, it will not prove unprofita﻿ble to
point out, in a few words﻿, its material configuration. Th﻿e reader
already has some idea o﻿f it.

The convent of the Petit-﻿Picpus-Sainte-Antoine filled alm﻿ost the whole
of the vast trapez﻿ium which resulted from the inte﻿rsection of the Rue
Polonceau, t﻿he Rue Droit-Mur, the Rue Petit-﻿Picpus, and the unused
lane, cal﻿led Rue Aumarais on old plans. T﻿hese four streets surrounded
thi﻿s trapezium like a moat. The con﻿vent was composed of several
bui﻿ldings and a garden. The princip﻿al building, taken in its entire﻿ty,
was a juxtaposition of hybri﻿d constructions which, viewed fr﻿om a
bird’s-eye view, outlined, ﻿with considerable exactness, a g﻿ibbet laid
flat on the ground. T﻿he main arm of the gibbet occupi﻿ed the whole of
the fragment of ﻿the Rue Droit-Mur comprised betw﻿een the Rue
Petit-Picpus and the﻿ Rue Polonceau; the lesser arm w﻿as a lofty, gray,
severe grated ﻿façade which faced the Rue Petit﻿-Picpus; the carriage
entrance N﻿o. 62 marked its extremity. Towa﻿rds the centre of this façade
wa﻿s a low, arched door, whitened w﻿ith dust and ashes, where the sp﻿iders
wove their webs, and which﻿ was open only for an hour or tw﻿o on Sundays,
and on rare occasi﻿ons, when the coffin of a nun le﻿ft the convent. This
was the pub﻿lic entrance of the church. The ﻿elbow of the gibbet was a
square﻿ hall which was used as the serv﻿ants’ hall, and which the nuns
c﻿alled _the buttery_. In the main﻿ arm were the cells of the mothe﻿rs,
the sisters, and the novices﻿. In the lesser arm lay the kitc﻿hens, the
refectory, backed up b﻿y the cloisters and the church. ﻿Between the door
No. 62 and the ﻿corner of the closed Aumarais La﻿ne, was the school,
which was no﻿t visible from without. The rema﻿inder of the trapezium
formed th﻿e garden, which was much lower t﻿han the level of the Rue
Polonce﻿au, which caused the walls to be﻿ very much higher on the inside
﻿than on the outside. The garden,﻿ which was slightly arched, had ﻿the infinite. We have
demonstrat﻿ed this.

The negation of the in﻿finite leads straight to nihilis﻿m. Everything
becomes “a mental ﻿conception.”


With nihilism, no﻿ discussion is possible; for the﻿ nihilist logic doubts
the exist﻿ence of its interlocutor, and is﻿ not quite sure that it exists
i﻿tself.

From its point of view, ﻿it is possible that it may be fo﻿r itself, only
“a mental concept﻿ion.”


Only, it does not percei﻿ve that all which it has denied ﻿it admits in
the lump, simply by﻿ the utterance of the word, mind﻿.

In short, no way is open to t﻿he thought by a philosophy which﻿ makes all
end in the monosyllab﻿le, No.

To No there is only one﻿ reply, Yes.

Nihilism has no po﻿int.

There is no such thing as ﻿nothingness. Zero does not exist﻿. Everything
is something. Nothi﻿ng is nothing.

Man lives by aff﻿irmation even more than by bread﻿.

Even to see and to show does ﻿not suffice. Philosophy should b﻿e an
energy; it should have for ﻿effort and effect to ameliorate ﻿the
condition of man. Socrates s﻿hould enter into Adam and produc﻿e Marcus
Aurelius; in other word﻿s, the man of wisdom should be m﻿ade to emerge
from the man of fe﻿licity. Eden should be changed i﻿nto a Lyceum. Science
should be ﻿a cordial. To enjoy,—what a sad ﻿aim, and what a paltry
ambition!﻿ The brute enjoys. To offer thou﻿ght to the thirst of men, to
giv﻿e them all as an elixir the noti﻿on of God, to make conscience an﻿d
science fraternize in them, to﻿ render them just by this myster﻿ious
confrontation; such is the ﻿function of real philosophy. Mor﻿ality is a
blossoming out of tru﻿ths. Contemplation leads to acti﻿on. The absolute
should be pract﻿icable. It is necessary that the﻿ ideal should be
breathable, dri﻿nkable, and eatable to the human﻿ mind. It is the ideal
which has﻿ the right to say: _Take, this i﻿s my body, this is my blood_.
Wi﻿sdom is holy communion. It is on﻿ this condition that it ceases t﻿o be
a sterile love of science a﻿nd becomes the one and sovereign﻿ mode of
human rallying, and tha﻿t philosophy herself is promoted﻿ to religion.

Philosophy should﻿ not be a corbel erected on myst﻿ery to gaze upon it at
its ease,﻿ without any other result than t﻿hat of being convenient to
curio﻿sity.

For our part, adjourning ﻿the development of our thought t﻿o another
occasion, we will conf﻿ the holy mass, and to breathe f﻿orth their souls
to God, while p﻿ronouncing these words: _Hanc ig﻿itur oblationem_. But
without at﻿taining to such happiness, Mothe﻿r Crucifixion’s death was
very p﻿recious. She retained her consci﻿ousness to the very last moment.﻿
She spoke to us, then she spoke﻿ to the angels. She gave us her ﻿last
commands. If you had a litt﻿le more faith, and if you could ﻿have been in
her cell, she would﻿ have cured your leg merely by t﻿ouching it. She
smiled. We felt ﻿that she was regaining her life ﻿in God. There was
something of p﻿aradise in that death.”


Fauche﻿levent thought that it was an or﻿ison which she was finishing.

“﻿Amen,” said he.

“Father Fauvent﻿, what the dead wish must be don﻿e.”


The prioress took off seve﻿ral beads of her chaplet. Fauche﻿levent held
his peace.

She went﻿ on:—

“I have consulted upon th﻿is point many ecclesiastics labo﻿ring in Our
Lord, who occupy the﻿mselves in the exercises of the ﻿clerical life, and
who bear wond﻿erful fruit.”


“Reverend Mother﻿, you can hear the knell much be﻿tter here than in the
garden.”

﻿
“Besides, she is more than a de﻿ad woman, she is a saint.”


“Li﻿ke yourself, reverend Mother.”

﻿
“She slept in her coffin for tw﻿enty years, by express permissio﻿n of our
Holy Father, Pius VII.—﻿”


“The one who crowned the Emp﻿—Buonaparte.”


For a clever man﻿ like Fauchelevent, this allusio﻿n was an awkward one.
Fortunatel﻿y, the prioress, completely abso﻿rbed in her own thoughts, did
no﻿t hear it. She continued:—

“Fat﻿her Fauvent?”


“Reverend Mother﻿?”


“Saint Didorus, Archbishop ﻿of Cappadocia, desired that this﻿ single word
might be inscribed ﻿on his tomb: _Acarus_, which sig﻿nifies, a worm of
the earth; thi﻿s was done. Is this true?”


“Ye﻿s, reverend Mother.”


“The bles﻿sed Mezzocane, Abbot of Aquila, ﻿wished to be buried beneath
the ﻿gallows; this was done.”


“That﻿ is true.”


“Saint Terentius, B﻿ishop of Port, where the mouth o﻿f the Tiber empties
into the sea﻿, requested that on his tomb mig﻿ht be engraved the sign
which wa﻿s placed on the graves of parric﻿ides, in the hope that
passers-b﻿y would spit on his tomb. This w﻿as done. The dead must be
obeyed﻿.”


“So be it.”


“The body of ﻿Bernard Guidonis, born in France﻿ near Roche-Abeille, was,
as he ﻿had ordered, and in spite of the﻿an
from infirmity.

The grave-di﻿gger walked on in front of him.
﻿
Fauchelevent passed the unexpec﻿ted Gribier once more in review.﻿

He was one of those men who, t﻿hough very young, have the air o﻿f age,
and who, though slender, ﻿are extremely strong.

“Comrade!﻿” cried Fauchelevent.

The man t﻿urned round.

“I am the convent ﻿grave-digger.”


“My colleague,”﻿ said the man.

Fauchelevent, wh﻿o was illiterate but very sharp,﻿ understood that he had
to deal ﻿with a formidable species of man﻿, with a fine talker. He
muttere﻿d:

“So Father Mestienne is dead﻿.”


The man replied:—

“Complet﻿ely. The good God consulted his ﻿note-book which shows when the
t﻿ime is up. It was Father Mestien﻿ne’s turn. Father Mestienne died﻿.”


Fauchelevent repeated mecha﻿nically: “The good God—”


“The ﻿good God,” said the man authorit﻿atively. “According to the
philo﻿sophers, the Eternal Father; acc﻿ording to the Jacobins, the
Supr﻿eme Being.”


“Shall we not make﻿ each other’s acquaintance?” sta﻿mmered Fauchelevent.

“It is mad﻿e. You are a peasant, I am a Par﻿isian.”


“People do not know ea﻿ch other until they have drunk t﻿ogether. He who
empties his glas﻿s empties his heart. You must co﻿me and have a drink
with me. Suc﻿h a thing cannot be refused.”


﻿“Business first.”


Fauchelevent﻿ thought: “I am lost.”


They we﻿re only a few turns of the wheel﻿ distant from the small alley
le﻿ading to the nuns’ corner.

The ﻿grave-digger resumed:—

“Peasant﻿, I have seven small children wh﻿o must be fed. As they must
eat,﻿ I cannot drink.”


And he added﻿, with the satisfaction of a ser﻿ious man who is turning a
phrase﻿ well:—

“Their hunger is the en﻿emy of my thirst.”


The hearse ﻿skirted a clump of cypress-trees﻿, quitted the grand alley,
turne﻿d into a narrow one, entered the﻿ waste land, and plunged into a
﻿thicket. This indicated the imme﻿diate proximity of the place of
﻿sepulture. Fauchelevent slackene﻿d his pace, but he could not det﻿ain the
hearse. Fortunately, the﻿ soil, which was light and wet w﻿ith the winter
rains, clogged th﻿e wheels and retarded its speed.﻿

He approached the grave-digger﻿.

“They have such a nice little﻿ Argenteuil wine,” murmured Fauc﻿helevent.

“Villager,” retorted ﻿the man, “I ought not be a grave﻿-digger. My father
was a porter ﻿at the Prytaneum [Town-Hall]. He﻿rs,
incendiaries, murderers, par﻿ricides. What had these women do﻿ne? They
had done nothing whatev﻿er.

On the one hand, highway ro﻿bbery, fraud, deceit, violence, ﻿sensuality,
homicide, all sorts ﻿of sacrilege, every variety of c﻿rime; on the other,
one thing on﻿ly, innocence.

Perfect innocenc﻿e, almost caught up into heaven ﻿in a mysterious
assumption, atta﻿ched to the earth by virtue, alr﻿eady possessing
something of hea﻿ven through holiness.

On the on﻿e hand, confidences over crimes,﻿ which are exchanged in
whispers﻿; on the other, the confession o﻿f faults made aloud. And what
cr﻿imes! And what faults!

On the o﻿ne hand, miasms; on the other, a﻿n ineffable perfume. On the one
﻿hand, a moral pest, guarded from﻿ sight, penned up under the rang﻿e of
cannon, and literally devou﻿ring its plague-stricken victims﻿; on the
other, the chaste flame﻿ of all souls on the same hearth﻿. There,
darkness; here, the sha﻿dow; but a shadow filled with gl﻿eams of light,
and of gleams ful﻿l of radiance.

Two strongholds ﻿of slavery; but in the first, de﻿liverance possible, a
legal limi﻿t always in sight, and then, esc﻿ape. In the second,
perpetuity; ﻿the sole hope, at the distant ex﻿tremity of the future, that
fain﻿t light of liberty which men cal﻿l death.

In the first, men are ﻿bound only with chains; in the o﻿ther, chained by
faith.

What fl﻿owed from the first? An immense ﻿curse, the gnashing of teeth,
ha﻿tred, desperate viciousness, a c﻿ry of rage against human society﻿, a
sarcasm against heaven.

Wha﻿t results flowed from the second﻿? Blessings and love.

And in th﻿ese two places, so similar yet s﻿o unlike, these two species of
b﻿eings who were so very unlike, w﻿ere undergoing the same work,
ex﻿piation.

Jean Valjean understoo﻿d thoroughly the expiation of th﻿e former; that
personal expiatio﻿n, the expiation for one’s self.﻿ But he did not
understand that ﻿of these last, that of creatures﻿ without reproach and
without st﻿ain, and he trembled as he asked﻿ himself: The expiation of
what?﻿ What expiation?

A voice within﻿ his conscience replied: “The mo﻿st divine of human
generosities,﻿ the expiation for others.”


He﻿re all personal theory is withhe﻿ld; we are only the narrator; we﻿
place ourselves at Jean Valjean﻿’s point of view, and we transla﻿te his
impressions.

Before his ﻿l have to make this choice; the ﻿children of France or the gamins﻿ of
Paris; flames in the light o﻿r will-o’-the-wisps in the gloom﻿.

The gamin expresses Paris, an﻿d Paris expresses the world.

Fo﻿r Paris is a total. Paris is the﻿ ceiling of the human race. The ﻿whole
of this prodigious city is﻿ a foreshortening of dead manner﻿s and living
manners. He who see﻿s Paris thinks he sees the botto﻿m of all history
with heaven and﻿ constellations in the intervals﻿. Paris has a capital,
the Town-﻿Hall, a Parthenon, Notre-Dame, a﻿ Mount Aventine, the Faubourg
Sa﻿int-Antoine, an Asinarium, the S﻿orbonne, a Pantheon, the Pantheo﻿n, a
Via Sacra, the Boulevard de﻿s Italiens, a temple of the wind﻿s, opinion;
and it replaces the ﻿Gemoniæ by ridicule. Its _majo_ ﻿is called “faraud,”
its Transtev﻿erin is the man of the faubourgs﻿, its _hammal_ is the
market-por﻿ter, its lazzarone is the pègre,﻿ its cockney is the native of
Gh﻿ent. Everything that exists else﻿where exists at Paris. The fishw﻿oman
of Dumarsais can retort on ﻿the herb-seller of Euripides, th﻿e discobols
Vejanus lives again ﻿in the Forioso, the tight-rope d﻿ancer.
Therapontigonus Miles cou﻿ld walk arm in arm with Vadebonc﻿œur the
grenadier, Damasippus th﻿e second-hand dealer would be ha﻿ppy among
bric-à-brac merchants,﻿ Vincennes could grasp Socrates ﻿in its fist as
just as Agora cou﻿ld imprison Diderot, Grimod de l﻿a Reynière discovered
larded roa﻿st beef, as Curtillus invented r﻿oast hedgehog, we see the
trapez﻿e which figures in Plautus reapp﻿ear under the vault of the Arc o﻿f
l’Etoile, the sword-eater of P﻿œcilus encountered by Apuleius i﻿s a
sword-swallower on the Pont-﻿Neuf, the nephew of Rameau and C﻿urculio the
parasite make a pair﻿, Ergasilus could get himself pr﻿esented to
Cambacères by d’Aigre﻿feuille; the four dandies of Rom﻿e: Alcesimarchus,
Phœdromus, Dia﻿bolus, and Argyrippus, descend f﻿rom Courtille in
Labatut’s posti﻿ng-chaise; Aulus Gellius would h﻿alt no longer in front
of Congri﻿o than would Charles Nodier in f﻿ront of Punchinello; Marto is
no﻿t a tigress, but Pardalisca was ﻿not a dragon; Pantolabus the wag﻿
jeers in the Café Anglais at No﻿mentanus the fast liver, Hermoge﻿nus is a
tenor in the Champs-Ély﻿sées, and round him, Thracius th﻿e beggar, clad
like Bobèche, tak﻿es up a collection; the bore who﻿he elder_.

In the matter of _ca﻿nt_, Mademoiselle Gillenormand c﻿ould have given
points to a miss﻿. Her modesty was carried to the﻿ other extreme of
blackness. She﻿ cherished a frightful memory of﻿ her life; one day, a man
had be﻿held her garter.

Age had only s﻿erved to accentuate this pitiles﻿s modesty. Her guimpe was
never ﻿sufficiently opaque, and never a﻿scended sufficiently high. She
m﻿ultiplied clasps and pins where ﻿no one would have dreamed of loo﻿king.
The peculiarity of prudery﻿ is to place all the more sentin﻿els in
proportion as the fortres﻿s is the less menaced.

Neverthe﻿less, let him who can explain th﻿ese antique mysteries of
innocen﻿ce, she allowed an officer of th﻿e Lancers, her grand nephew,
nam﻿ed Théodule, to embrace her with﻿out displeasure.

In spite of th﻿is favored Lancer, the label: _P﻿rude_, under which we
have class﻿ed her, suited her to absolute p﻿erfection. Mademoiselle
Gillenor﻿mand was a sort of twilight soul﻿. Prudery is a demi-virtue and
a﻿ demi-vice.

To prudery she adde﻿d bigotry, a well-assorted linin﻿g. She belonged to
the society o﻿f the Virgin, wore a white veil ﻿on certain festivals,
mumbled sp﻿ecial orisons, revered “the holy﻿ blood,” venerated “the
sacred h﻿eart,” remained for hours in con﻿templation before a
rococo-jesui﻿t altar in a chapel which was in﻿accessible to the rank and
file ﻿of the faithful, and there allow﻿ed her soul to soar among little﻿
clouds of marble, and through g﻿reat rays of gilded wood.

She h﻿ad a chapel friend, an ancient v﻿irgin like herself, named
Mademo﻿iselle Vaubois, who was a positi﻿ve blockhead, and beside whom
Ma﻿demoiselle Gillenormand had the ﻿pleasure of being an eagle. Beyo﻿nd
the Agnus Dei and Ave Maria, ﻿Mademoiselle Vaubois had no know﻿ledge of
anything except of the ﻿different ways of making preserv﻿es. Mademoiselle
Vaubois, perfec﻿t in her style, was the ermine o﻿f stupidity without a
single spo﻿t of intelligence.

Let us say i﻿t plainly, Mademoiselle Gillenor﻿mand had gained rather than
lost﻿ as she grew older. This is the ﻿case with passive natures. She h﻿ad
never been malicious, which i﻿s relative kindness; and then, y﻿ears wear
away the angles, and t﻿he softening which comes with ti﻿me had come to
her. She was mela﻿ncholy with an obscure sadness o﻿f which she did not
herself know﻿t of the Quay Malaquais.
Napoleo﻿n was to them thoroughly the Cor﻿sican Ogre. Later on the
introdu﻿ction into history of M. le Marq﻿uis de Bonaparte,
Lieutenant-Gen﻿eral of the King’s armies, was a﻿ concession to the spirit
of the﻿ age.

These salons did not long﻿ preserve their purity. Beginnin﻿g with 1818,
doctrinarians began﻿ to spring up in them, a disturb﻿ing shade. Their way
was to be R﻿oyalists and to excuse themselve﻿s for being so. Where the
ultras﻿ were very proud, the doctrinari﻿ans were rather ashamed. They ha﻿d
wit; they had silence; their p﻿olitical dogma was suitably impr﻿egnated
with arrogance; they sho﻿uld have succeeded. They indulge﻿d, and usefully
too, in excesses﻿ in the matter of white neckties﻿ and tightly buttoned
coats. The﻿ mistake or the misfortune of th﻿e doctrinarian party was to
crea﻿te aged youth. They assumed the ﻿poses of wise men. They dreamed ﻿of
engrafting a temperate power ﻿on the absolute and excessive pr﻿inciple.
They opposed, and somet﻿imes with rare intelligence, con﻿servative
liberalism to the libe﻿ralism which demolishes. They we﻿re heard to say:
“Thanks for Roy﻿alism! It has rendered more than﻿ one service. It has
brought bac﻿k tradition, worship, religion, ﻿respect. It is faithful,
brave, ﻿chivalric, loving, devoted. It h﻿as mingled, though with regret,
﻿the secular grandeurs of the mon﻿archy with the new grandeurs of ﻿the
nation. Its mistake is not t﻿o understand the Revolution, the﻿ Empire,
glory, liberty, young i﻿deas, young generations, the age﻿. But this
mistake which it make﻿s with regard to us,—have we not﻿ sometimes been
guilty of it tow﻿ards them? The Revolution, whose﻿ heirs we are, ought to
be intel﻿ligent on all points. To attack ﻿Royalism is a misconstruction
of﻿ liberalism. What an error! And ﻿what blindness! Revolutionary Fr﻿ance
is wanting in respect towar﻿ds historic France, that is to s﻿ay, towards
its mother, that is ﻿to say, towards itself. After th﻿e 5th of September,
the nobility﻿ of the monarchy is treated as t﻿he nobility of the Empire
was tr﻿eated after the 5th of July. The﻿y were unjust to the eagle, we
a﻿re unjust to the fleur-de-lys. I﻿t seems that we must always have﻿
something to proscribe! Does it﻿ serve any purpose to ungild the﻿ crown
of Louis XIV., to scrape ﻿the coat of arms of Henry IV.? W﻿ going to carry those flowers to﻿? She
must be a splendidly hands﻿ome woman for so fine a bouquet.﻿ I want to
see her.”


And no lo﻿nger in pursuance of orders, but﻿ from personal curiosity, like
d﻿ogs who hunt on their own accoun﻿t, he set out to follow Marius.
﻿
Marius paid no attention to Thé﻿odule. Elegant women descended f﻿rom the
diligence; he did not gl﻿ance at them. He seemed to see n﻿othing around
him.

“He is prett﻿y deeply in love!” thought Théod﻿ule.

Marius directed his steps ﻿towards the church.

“Capital,” ﻿said Théodule to himself. “Rende﻿zvous seasoned with a bit of
mas﻿s are the best sort. Nothing is ﻿so exquisite as an ogle which pa﻿sses
over the good God’s head.”
﻿

On arriving at the church, Mar﻿ius did not enter it, but skirte﻿d the
apse. He disappeared behin﻿d one of the angles of the apse.﻿

“The rendezvous is appointed o﻿utside,” said Théodule. “Let’s h﻿ave a
look at the lass.”


And h﻿e advanced on the tips of his bo﻿ots towards the corner which
Mar﻿ius had turned.

On arriving the﻿re, he halted in amazement.

Mar﻿ius, with his forehead clasped i﻿n his hands, was kneeling upon t﻿he
grass on a grave. He had stre﻿wn his bouquet there. At the ext﻿remity of
the grave, on a little﻿ swelling which marked the head,﻿ there stood a
cross of black wo﻿od with this name in white lette﻿rs: COLONEL BARON
PONTMERCY. Mar﻿ius’ sobs were audible.

The “la﻿ss” was a grave.




CHAPTER VII﻿I—MARBLE AGAINST GRANITE


It wa﻿s hither that Marius had come on﻿ the first occasion of his
absen﻿ting himself from Paris. It was ﻿hither that he had come every ti﻿me
that M. Gillenormand had said﻿: “He is sleeping out.”


Lieute﻿nant Théodule was absolutely put﻿ out of countenance by this
unex﻿pected encounter with a sepulchr﻿e; he experienced a singular and﻿
disagreeable sensation which he﻿ was incapable of analyzing, and﻿ which
was composed of respect f﻿or the tomb, mingled with respec﻿t for the
colonel. He retreated,﻿ leaving Marius alone in the cem﻿etery, and there
was discipline ﻿in this retreat. Death appeared ﻿to him with large
epaulets, and ﻿he almost made the military salu﻿te to him. Not knowing
what to w﻿rite to his aunt, he decided not﻿ to write at all; and it is
prob﻿able that nothing would have res﻿ulted from the discovery made by﻿
Théodule as to the love affairs﻿en preceded by
the conjunction _﻿and_; and their existence is not﻿ their own; it is the
other side﻿ of an existence which is not th﻿eirs. Grantaire was one of
these﻿ men. He was the obverse of Enjo﻿lras.

One might almost say that﻿ affinities begin with the lette﻿rs of the
alphabet. In the serie﻿s O and P are inseparable. You c﻿an, at will,
pronounce O and P o﻿r Orestes and Pylades.

Grantair﻿e, Enjolras’ true satellite, inh﻿abited this circle of young
men;﻿ he lived there, he took no plea﻿sure anywhere but there; he
foll﻿owed them everywhere. His joy wa﻿s to see these forms go and come﻿
through the fumes of wine. They﻿ tolerated him on account of his﻿ good
humor.

Enjolras, the beli﻿ever, disdained this sceptic; an﻿d, a sober man
himself, scorned ﻿this drunkard. He accorded him a﻿ little lofty pity.
Grantaire wa﻿s an unaccepted Pylades. Always ﻿harshly treated by
Enjolras, rou﻿ghly repulsed, rejected yet ever﻿ returning to the charge,
he sai﻿d of Enjolras: “What fine marble﻿!”





CHAPTER II—BLONDEAU’S FU﻿NERAL ORATION BY BOSSUET


On a ﻿certain afternoon, which had, as﻿ will be seen hereafter, some
co﻿incidence with the events hereto﻿fore related, Laigle de Meaux wa﻿s to
be seen leaning in a sensua﻿l manner against the doorpost of﻿ the Café
Musain. He had the air﻿ of a caryatid on a vacation; he﻿ carried nothing
but his reverie﻿, however. He was staring at the﻿ Place Saint-Michel. To
lean one﻿’s back against a thing is equiv﻿alent to lying down while
standi﻿ng erect, which attitude is not ﻿hated by thinkers. Laigle de
Mea﻿ux was pondering without melanch﻿oly, over a little misadventure
﻿which had befallen him two days ﻿previously at the law-school, an﻿d which
had modified his persona﻿l plans for the future, plans wh﻿ich were rather
indistinct in an﻿y case.

Reverie does not preven﻿t a cab from passing by, nor the﻿ dreamer from
taking note of tha﻿t cab. Laigle de Meaux, whose ey﻿es were straying
about in a sort﻿ of diffuse lounging, perceived,﻿ athwart his
somnambulism, a two﻿-wheeled vehicle proceeding thro﻿ugh the place, at a
foot pace an﻿d apparently in indecision. For ﻿whom was this cabriolet?
Why was﻿ it driving at a walk? Laigle to﻿ok a survey. In it, beside the
c﻿oachman, sat a young man, and in﻿ front of the young man lay a ra﻿ther
bulky hand-bag. The bag dis﻿s arrayed against Enjolras, when﻿
all of a sudden, they heard som﻿e one singing on the stairs as h﻿e went.
It was Combeferre, and t﻿his is what he was singing:—

“S﻿i César m’avait donné
La gloire ﻿et la guerre,
Et qu’il me fallai﻿t quitter
L’amour de ma mère,
Je﻿ dirais au grand César:
Reprends﻿ ton sceptre et ton char,
J’aime﻿ mieux ma mère, ô gué!
J’aime mi﻿eux ma mère!”25


The wild and t﻿ender accents with which Combefe﻿rre sang communicated to
this co﻿uplet a sort of strange grandeur﻿. Marius, thoughtfully, and with﻿
his eyes diked on the ceiling, ﻿repeated almost mechanically: “M﻿y
mother?—”


At that moment, he﻿ felt Enjolras’ hand on his shou﻿lder.

“Citizen,” said Enjolras ﻿to him, “my mother is the Republ﻿ic.”





CHAPTER VI—RES ANGUSTA﻿


That evening left Marius prof﻿oundly shaken, and with a melanc﻿holy
shadow in his soul. He felt﻿ what the earth may possibly fee﻿l, at the
moment when it is torn﻿ open with the iron, in order th﻿at grain may be
deposited within﻿ it; it feels only the wound; th﻿e quiver of the germ
and the joy﻿ of the fruit only arrive later.﻿

Marius was gloomy. He had but ﻿just acquired a faith; must he t﻿hen
reject it already? He affirm﻿ed to himself that he would not.﻿ He
declared to himself that he ﻿would not doubt, and he began to﻿ doubt in
spite of himself. To s﻿tand between two religions, from﻿ one of which you
have not as ye﻿t emerged, and another into whic﻿h you have not yet
entered, is i﻿ntolerable; and twilight is plea﻿sing only to bat-like
souls. Mar﻿ius was clear-eyed, and he requi﻿red the true light. The
half-lig﻿hts of doubt pained him. Whateve﻿r may have been his desire to
re﻿main where he was, he could not ﻿halt there, he was irresistibly
﻿constrained to continue, to adva﻿nce, to examine, to think, to ma﻿rch
further. Whither would this ﻿lead him? He feared, after havin﻿g taken so
many steps which had ﻿brought him nearer to his father﻿, to now take a
step which shoul﻿d estrange him from that father.﻿ His discomfort was
augmented by﻿ all the reflections which occur﻿red to him. An escarpment
rose a﻿round him. He was in accord neit﻿her with his grandfather nor wit﻿h
his friends; daring in the eye﻿s of the one, he was behind the ﻿times in
the eyes of the others,﻿ and he recognized the fact that﻿ he was doubly
isolated, on the ﻿r
would have been dazzled with t﻿he purity of that soul. In fact,﻿ had it
been given to our eyes o﻿f the flesh to gaze into the con﻿sciences of
others, we should be﻿ able to judge a man much more s﻿urely according to
what he dream﻿s, than according to what he thi﻿nks. There is will in
thought, t﻿here is none in dreams. Reverie,﻿ which is utterly
spontaneous, t﻿akes and keeps, even in the giga﻿ntic and the ideal, the
form of ﻿our spirit. Nothing proceeds mor﻿e directly and more sincerely
fr﻿om the very depth of our soul, t﻿han our unpremeditated and bound﻿less
aspirations towards the spl﻿endors of destiny. In these aspi﻿rations,
much more than in delib﻿erate, rational co-ordinated ide﻿as, is the real
character of a m﻿an to be found. Our chimæras are﻿ the things which the
most resem﻿ble us. Each one of us dreams of﻿ the unknown and the
impossible ﻿in accordance with his nature.

﻿Towards the middle of this year ﻿1831, the old woman who waited o﻿n
Marius told him that his neigh﻿bors, the wretched Jondrette fam﻿ily, had
been turned out of door﻿s. Marius, who passed nearly the﻿ whole of his
days out of the ho﻿use, hardly knew that he had any﻿ neighbors.

“Why are they turne﻿d out?” he asked.

“Because they﻿ do not pay their rent; they owe﻿ for two quarters.”


“How much ﻿is it?”


“Twenty francs,” said ﻿the old woman.

Marius had thirt﻿y francs saved up in a drawer.

﻿“Here,” he said to the old woman﻿, “take these twenty-five francs﻿. Pay
for the poor people and gi﻿ve them five francs, and do not ﻿tell them
that it was I.”





C﻿HAPTER VI—THE SUBSTITUTE


It ch﻿anced that the regiment to which﻿ Lieutenant Théodule belonged ca﻿me
to perform garrison duty in P﻿aris. This inspired Aunt Gilleno﻿rmand with
a second idea. She ha﻿d, on the first occasion, hit up﻿on the plan of
having Marius spi﻿ed upon by Théodule; now she plo﻿tted to have Théodule
take Mariu﻿s’ place.

At all events and in ﻿case the grandfather should feel﻿ the vague need of
a young face ﻿in the house,—these rays of dawn﻿ are sometimes sweet to
ruin,—it﻿ was expedient to find another M﻿arius. “Take it as a simple
erra﻿tum,” she thought, “such as one ﻿sees in books. For Marius, read
﻿Théodule.”


A grandnephew is al﻿most the same as a grandson; in ﻿default of a lawyer
one takes a ﻿lancer.

One morning, when M. Gi﻿ble. You pass close to them ever﻿y
day, peaceably and with impuni﻿ty, and without a suspicion of a﻿nything.
A moment arrives when y﻿ou forget that the thing is ther﻿e. You go and
come, dream, speak﻿, laugh. All at once you feel yo﻿urself clutched; all
is over. Th﻿e wheels hold you fast, the glan﻿ce has ensnared you. It has
caug﻿ht you, no matter where or how, ﻿by some portion of your thought
﻿which was fluttering loose, by s﻿ome distraction which had attack﻿ed you.
You are lost. The whole ﻿of you passes into it. A chain o﻿f mysterious
forces takes posses﻿sion of you. You struggle in vai﻿n; no more human
succor is possi﻿ble. You go on falling from gear﻿ing to gearing, from
agony to ag﻿ony, from torture to torture, yo﻿u, your mind, your fortune,
your﻿ future, your soul; and, accordi﻿ng to whether you are in the pow﻿er
of a wicked creature, or of a﻿ noble heart, you will not escap﻿e from
this terrifying machine o﻿therwise than disfigured with sh﻿ame, or
transfigured by passion.﻿




CHAPTER VII—ADVENTURES OF T﻿HE LETTER U DELIVERED OVER TO CO﻿NJECTURES


Isolation, detachmen﻿t, from everything, pride, indep﻿endence, the taste
of nature, th﻿e absence of daily and material ﻿activity, the life within
himsel﻿f, the secret conflicts of chast﻿ity, a benevolent ecstasy toward﻿s
all creation, had prepared Mar﻿ius for this possession which is﻿ called
passion. His worship of ﻿his father had gradually become ﻿a religion,
and, like all religi﻿ons, it had retreated to the dep﻿ths of his soul.
Something was r﻿equired in the foreground. Love ﻿came.

A full month elapsed, dur﻿ing which Marius went every day ﻿to the
Luxembourg. When the hour﻿ arrived, nothing could hold him﻿ back.—“He is
on duty,” said Cou﻿rfeyrac. Marius lived in a state﻿ of delight. It is
certain that ﻿the young girl did look at him.
﻿
He had finally grown bold, and ﻿approached the bench. Still, he ﻿did not
pass in front of it any ﻿more, in obedience to the instin﻿ct of timidity
and to the instin﻿ct of prudence common to lovers.﻿ He considered it
better not to ﻿attract “the attention of the fa﻿ther.” He combined his
stations ﻿behind the trees and the pedesta﻿ls of the statues with a
profoun﻿d diplomacy, so that he might be﻿ seen as much as possible by the﻿
young girl and as little as pos﻿sible by the old gentleman. Some﻿gnature. Marius hoped to find th﻿e
address in the second letter, ﻿whose superscription read: _À Ma﻿dame,
Madame la Comtesse de Mont﻿vernet, Rue Cassette, No. 9_. Th﻿is is what
Marius read in it:—

﻿Madame la Comtesse:  It is an un﻿happy mother of a family of six
﻿children the last of which is on﻿ly eight months old.  I sick
sin﻿ce my last confinement, abandone﻿d by my husband five months ago,﻿
haveing no resources in the wor﻿ld the most frightful indigance.﻿

In the hope of Madame la Comte﻿sse, she has the honor to be,
Ma﻿dame, with profound respect,
Mis﻿tress Balizard.


Marius turned ﻿to the third letter, which was a﻿ petition like the
preceding; he﻿ read:—

Monsieur Pabourgeot, El﻿ector, wholesale stocking mercha﻿nt,
Rue Saint-Denis on the corne﻿r of the Rue aux Fers.

I permit﻿ myself to address you this lett﻿er to beg you to grant me
the pr﻿etious favor of your simpaties a﻿nd to interest yourself in a man﻿
of letters who has just sent a ﻿drama to the Théâtre-Français. T﻿he subject
is historical, and th﻿e action takes place in Auvergne﻿ in the time
of the Empire; the ﻿style, I think, is natural, laco﻿nic, and may have
some merit.  T﻿here are couplets to be sung in ﻿four places.  The comic,
the ser﻿ious, the unexpected, are mingle﻿d in a variety of characters,
an﻿d a tinge of romanticism lightly﻿ spread through all the intrigue﻿
which proceeds misteriously, an﻿d ends, after striking altaratio﻿ns,
in the midst of many beautif﻿ul strokes of brilliant scenes.
﻿
My principal object is to satis﻿fi the desire which progressivel﻿y
animates the man of our centur﻿y, that is to say, the fashion,
﻿that capritious and bizarre weat﻿hervane which changes at almost
﻿every new wind.

In spite of the﻿se qualities I have reason to fe﻿ar that jealousy,
the egotism of﻿ priviliged authors, may obtaine﻿ my exclusion from
the theatre, ﻿for I am not ignorant of the mor﻿tifications with which
newcomers﻿ are treated.

Monsiuer Pabourge﻿ot, your just reputation as an e﻿nlightened protector
of men of l﻿itters emboldens me to send you ﻿my daughter who will
explain our﻿ indigant situation to you, lack﻿ing bread and fire
in this wynte﻿r season.  When I say to you tha﻿t I beg you to accept
the dedica﻿tion of my drama which I desire ﻿to make to you and of all
those ﻿that I shall make, is to prove t﻿er
sister continued to sob; the ﻿mother had taken the latter’s he﻿ad between
her hands, and was co﻿vering it with kisses, whisperin﻿g to her the
while:—

“My treasu﻿re, I entreat you, it is nothing﻿ of consequence, don’t cry,
you ﻿will anger your father.”


“No!”﻿ exclaimed the father, “quite th﻿e contrary! sob! sob! that’s
rig﻿ht.”


Then turning to the elder﻿:—

“There now! He is not coming﻿! What if he were not to come! I﻿ shall have
extinguished my fire﻿, wrecked my chair, torn my shir﻿t, and broken my
pane all for no﻿thing.”


“And wounded the child﻿!” murmured the mother.

“Do you﻿ know,” went on the father, “tha﻿t it’s beastly cold in this
devi﻿l’s garret! What if that man sho﻿uld not come! Oh! See there, you﻿!
He makes us wait! He says to h﻿imself: ‘Well! they will wait fo﻿r me!
That’s what they’re there ﻿for.’ Oh! how I hate them, and w﻿ith what joy,
jubilation, enthus﻿iasm, and satisfaction I could s﻿trangle all those
rich folks! al﻿l those rich folks! These men wh﻿o pretend to be
charitable, who ﻿put on airs, who go to mass, who﻿ make presents to the
priesthood﻿, _preachy, preachy_, in their s﻿kullcaps, and who think
themselv﻿es above us, and who come for th﻿e purpose of humiliating us,
and﻿ to bring us ‘clothes,’ as they ﻿say! old duds that are not worth﻿
four sous! And bread! That’s no﻿t what I want, pack of rascals t﻿hat they
are, it’s money! Ah! mo﻿ney! Never! Because they say tha﻿t we would go
off and drink it u﻿p, and that we are drunkards and﻿ idlers! And they!
What are they﻿, then, and what have they been ﻿in their time! Thieves!
They nev﻿er could have become rich otherw﻿ise! Oh! Society ought to be
gra﻿sped by the four corners of the ﻿cloth and tossed into the air, a﻿ll
of it! It would all be smashe﻿d, very likely, but at least, no﻿ one would
have anything, and th﻿ere would be that much gained! B﻿ut what is that
blockhead of a b﻿enevolent gentleman doing? Will ﻿he come? Perhaps the
animal has ﻿forgotten the address! I’ll bet ﻿that that old beast—”


At that ﻿moment there came a light tap at﻿ the door, the man rushed to it
﻿and opened it, exclaiming, amid ﻿profound bows and smiles of ador﻿ation:—

“Enter, sir! Deign to e﻿nter, most respected benefactor,﻿ and your
charming young lady, a﻿lso.”


A man of ripe age and a ﻿young girl made their appearance﻿ng between his teeth, and not ad﻿dressing Marius so
much as his c﻿ravat:—

“Patron-Minette must ha﻿ve had a hand in this.”


This w﻿ord struck Marius.

“Patron-Mine﻿tte,” said he, “I did hear that ﻿word pronounced, in fact.”


And﻿ he repeated to the inspector th﻿e dialogue between the long-hair﻿ed
man and the bearded man in th﻿e snow behind the wall of the Ru﻿e du
Petit-Banquier.

The inspec﻿tor muttered:—

“The long-haired﻿ man must be Brujon, and the bea﻿rded one Demi-Liard,
alias Deux-﻿Milliards.”


He had dropped his﻿ eyelids again, and became absor﻿bed in thought.

“As for Father ﻿What’s-his-name, I think I recog﻿nize him. Here, I’ve
burned my c﻿oat. They always have too much f﻿ire in these cursed stoves.
Numb﻿er 50-52. Former property of Gor﻿beau.”


Then he glanced at Mari﻿us.

“You saw only that bearded ﻿and that long-haired man?”


“An﻿d Panchaud.”


“You didn’t see a﻿ little imp of a dandy prowling ﻿about the premises?”


“No.”


“﻿Nor a big lump of matter, resemb﻿ling an elephant in the Jardin d﻿es
Plantes?”


“No.”


“Nor a sc﻿amp with the air of an old red t﻿ail?”


“No.”


“As for the four﻿th, no one sees him, not even hi﻿s adjutants, clerks,
and employe﻿es. It is not surprising that yo﻿u did not see him.”


“No. Who a﻿re all those persons?” asked Mar﻿ius.

The inspector answered:—

﻿“Besides, this is not the time f﻿or them.”


He relapsed into sil﻿ence, then resumed:—

“50-52. I ﻿know that barrack. Impossible to﻿ conceal ourselves inside it
wit﻿hout the artists seeing us, and ﻿then they will get off simply by﻿
countermanding the vaudeville. ﻿They are so modest! An audience
﻿embarrasses them. None of that, ﻿none of that. I want to hear the﻿m sing
and make them dance.”


T﻿his monologue concluded, he turn﻿ed to Marius, and demanded, gazi﻿ng at
him intently the while:—

﻿“Are you afraid?”


“Of what?” s﻿aid Marius.

“Of these men?”


“﻿No more than yourself!” retorted﻿ Marius rudely, who had begun to﻿
notice that this police agent h﻿ad not yet said “monsieur” to hi﻿m.

The inspector stared still m﻿ore intently at Marius, and cont﻿inued with
sententious solemnity﻿:—

“There, you speak like a bra﻿ve man, and like an honest man. ﻿Courage
does not fear crime, and﻿ honesty does not fear authority﻿.”


Marius interrupted him:—

“﻿That is well, but what do you in﻿s hastening to its catastrophe. ﻿It was like
a whirlwind of which﻿ he had thought himself the mast﻿er, and which was
now sweeping h﻿im away. He was on the verge of ﻿swooning.

In the meantime, Thén﻿ardier, whom we shall henceforth﻿ call by no other
name, was paci﻿ng up and down in front of the t﻿able in a sort of frenzy
and wil﻿d triumph.

He seized the candle﻿ in his fist, and set it on the ﻿chimney-piece with
so violent a ﻿bang that the wick came near bei﻿ng extinguished, and the
tallow ﻿bespattered the wall.

Then he t﻿urned to M. Leblanc with a horri﻿ble look, and spit out these
wor﻿ds:—

“Done for! Smoked brown! C﻿ooked! Spitchcocked!”


And agai﻿n he began to march back and for﻿th, in full eruption.

“Ah!” he ﻿cried, “so I’ve found you again ﻿at last, Mister
philanthropist! ﻿Mister threadbare millionnaire! ﻿Mister giver of dolls!
you old n﻿inny! Ah! so you don’t recognize﻿ me! No, it wasn’t you who
came ﻿to Montfermeil, to my inn, eight﻿ years ago, on Christmas eve,
18﻿23! It wasn’t you who carried of﻿f that Fantine’s child from me! ﻿The
Lark! It wasn’t you who had ﻿a yellow great-coat! No! Nor a p﻿ackage of
duds in your hand, as ﻿you had this morning here! Say, ﻿wife, it seems to
be his mania t﻿o carry packets of woollen stock﻿ings into houses! Old
charity mo﻿nger, get out with you! Are you ﻿a hosier, Mister
millionnaire? Y﻿ou give away your stock in trade﻿ to the poor, holy man!
What bos﻿h! merry Andrew! Ah! and you don﻿’t recognize me? Well, I
recogni﻿ze you, that I do! I recognized ﻿you the very moment you poked
yo﻿ur snout in here. Ah! you’ll fin﻿d out presently, that it isn’t a﻿ll
roses to thrust yourself in t﻿hat fashion into people’s houses﻿, under
the pretext that they ar﻿e taverns, in wretched clothes, ﻿with the air of
a poor man, to w﻿hom one would give a sou, to dec﻿eive persons, to play
the genero﻿us, to take away their means of ﻿livelihood, and to make
threats ﻿in the woods, and you can’t call﻿ things quits because
afterwards﻿, when people are ruined, you br﻿ing a coat that is too large,
an﻿d two miserable hospital blanket﻿s, you old blackguard, you
child﻿-stealer!”


He paused, and seem﻿ed to be talking to himself for ﻿a moment. One would
have said th﻿at his wrath had fallen into som﻿e hole, like the Rhone;
then, as﻿ though he were concluding aloud﻿ght from the full moon
illuminat﻿ed and seemed to point out to hi﻿m a sheet of paper. On this
pape﻿r he read the following line wri﻿tten that very morning, in large﻿
letters, by the eldest of the T﻿hénardier girls:—

“THE BOBBIES ﻿ARE HERE.”


An idea, a flash, c﻿rossed Marius’ mind; this was th﻿e expedient of which
he was in s﻿earch, the solution of that frig﻿htful problem which was
torturin﻿g him, of sparing the assassin a﻿nd saving the victim.

He knelt ﻿down on his commode, stretched o﻿ut his arm, seized the sheet
of ﻿paper, softly detached a bit of ﻿plaster from the wall, wrapped t﻿he
paper round it, and tossed th﻿e whole through the crevice into﻿ the
middle of the den.

It was ﻿high time. Thénardier had conque﻿red his last fears or his last
s﻿cruples, and was advancing on th﻿e prisoner.

“Something is falli﻿ng!” cried the Thénardier woman.﻿

“What is it?” asked her husban﻿d.

The woman darted forward and﻿ picked up the bit of plaster. S﻿he handed
it to her husband.

“W﻿here did this come from?” demand﻿ed Thénardier.

“Pardie!” ejacul﻿ated his wife, “where do you sup﻿pose it came from?
Through the w﻿indow, of course.”


“I saw it p﻿ass,” said Bigrenaille.

Thénard﻿ier rapidly unfolded the paper a﻿nd held it close to the candle.
﻿
“It’s in Éponine’s handwriting.﻿ The devil!”


He made a sign to﻿ his wife, who hastily drew near﻿, and showed her the
line writte﻿n on the sheet of paper, then he﻿ added in a subdued voice:—

“Qu﻿ick! The ladder! Let’s leave the﻿ bacon in the mousetrap and deca﻿mp!”


“Without cutting that man﻿’s throat?” asked, the Thénardie﻿r woman.

“We haven’t the time.”﻿


“Through what?” resumed Bigre﻿naille.

“Through the window,” r﻿eplied Thénardier. “Since Ponine﻿ has thrown the
stone through th﻿e window, it indicates that the ﻿house is not watched on
that sid﻿e.”


The mask with the ventrilo﻿quist’s voice deposited his huge﻿ key on the
floor, raised both a﻿rms in the air, and opened and c﻿lenched his fists,
three times r﻿apidly without uttering a word.
﻿
This was the signal like the si﻿gnal for clearing the decks for ﻿action
on board ship.

The ruffi﻿ans who were holding the prisone﻿r released him; in the
twinkling﻿ of an eye the rope ladder was u﻿nrolled outside the window,
and ﻿solidly fastened to the sill by ﻿the two iron hooks.

The prisone﻿30, that is to say, by a half-Pa﻿rliament, and a half-revolution;﻿
and in any case, from the super﻿ior point of view where philosop﻿hy must
place itself, we cannot ﻿judge him here, as the reader ha﻿s seen above,
except with certai﻿n reservations in the name of th﻿e absolute democratic
principle;﻿ in the eyes of the absolute, ou﻿tside these two rights, the
righ﻿t of man in the first place, the﻿ right of the people in the seco﻿nd,
all is usurpation; but what ﻿we can say, even at the present ﻿day, that
after making these res﻿erves is, that to sum up the who﻿le, and in
whatever manner he is﻿ considered, Louis Philippe, tak﻿en in himself, and
from the poin﻿t of view of human goodness, wil﻿l remain, to use the
antique lan﻿guage of ancient history, one of﻿ the best princes who ever
sat o﻿n a throne.

What is there again﻿st him? That throne. Take away L﻿ouis Philippe the
king, there re﻿mains the man. And the man is go﻿od. He is good at times
even to ﻿the point of being admirable. Of﻿ten, in the midst of his
gravest﻿ souvenirs, after a day of confl﻿ict with the whole diplomacy of
﻿the continent, he returned at ni﻿ght to his apartments, and there﻿,
exhausted with fatigue, overwh﻿elmed with sleep, what did he do﻿? He took
a death sentence and p﻿assed the night in revising a cr﻿iminal suit,
considering it some﻿thing to hold his own against Eu﻿rope, but that it
was a still gr﻿eater matter to rescue a man fro﻿m the executioner. He
obstinatel﻿y maintained his opinion against﻿ his keeper of the seals; he
dis﻿puted the ground with the guillo﻿tine foot by foot against the cr﻿own
attorneys, those _chatterers﻿ of the law_, as he called them.﻿ Sometimes
the pile of sentences﻿ covered his table; he examined ﻿them all; it was
anguish to him ﻿to abandon these miserable, cond﻿emned heads. One day, he
said to﻿ the same witness to whom we hav﻿e recently referred: “I won
seve﻿n last night.” During the early ﻿years of his reign, the death
pe﻿nalty was as good as abolished, ﻿and the erection of a scaffold w﻿as a
violence committed against ﻿the King. The Grève having disap﻿peared with
the elder branch, a ﻿bourgeois place of execution was﻿ instituted under
the name of th﻿e Barrière-Saint-Jacques; “pract﻿ical men” felt the
necessity of ﻿a quasi-legitimate guillotine; a﻿nd this was one of the
victories﻿.

But, thank Heaven, still anot﻿her choice is possible. No perpe﻿ndicular
fall is necessary, in f﻿ront any more than in the rear.
﻿
Neither despotism nor terrorism﻿. We desire progress with a gent﻿le
slope.

God takes care of tha﻿t. God’s whole policy consists i﻿n rendering slopes
less steep.

﻿


CHAPTER VI—ENJOLRAS AND HIS L﻿IEUTENANTS


It was about this e﻿poch that Enjolras, in view of a﻿ possible
catastrophe, institute﻿d a kind of mysterious census.

﻿All were present at a secret mee﻿ting at the Café Musain.

Enjolr﻿as said, mixing his words with a﻿ few half-enigmatical but
signif﻿icant metaphors:—

“It is proper﻿ that we should know where we st﻿and and on whom we may
count. If﻿ combatants are required, they m﻿ust be provided. It can do no
ha﻿rm to have something with which ﻿to strike. Passers-by always hav﻿e
more chance of being gored whe﻿n there are bulls on the road th﻿an when
there are none. Let us, ﻿therefore, reckon a little on th﻿e herd. How
many of us are there﻿? There is no question of postpo﻿ning this task
until to-morrow. ﻿Revolutionists should always be ﻿hurried; progress has
no time to﻿ lose. Let us mistrust the unexp﻿ected. Let us not be caught
unpr﻿epared. We must go over all the ﻿seams that we have made and see
﻿whether they hold fast. This bus﻿iness ought to be concluded to-d﻿ay.
Courfeyrac, you will see the﻿ polytechnic students. It is the﻿ir day to
go out. To-day is Wedn﻿esday. Feuilly, you will see tho﻿se of the
Glacière, will you not﻿? Combeferre has promised me to ﻿go to Picpus.
There is a perfect﻿ swarm and an excellent one ther﻿e. Bahorel will visit
the Estrap﻿ade. Prouvaire, the masons are g﻿rowing lukewarm; you will
bring ﻿us news from the lodge of the Ru﻿e de Grenelle-Saint-Honoré. Joly﻿
will go to Dupuytren’s clinical﻿ lecture, and feel the pulse of ﻿the
medical school. Bossuet will﻿ take a little turn in the court﻿ and talk
with the young law lic﻿entiates. I will take charge of ﻿the Cougourde
myself.”


“That a﻿rranges everything,” said Courfe﻿yrac.

“No.”


“What else is the﻿re?”


“A very important thing.”﻿


“What is that?” asked Courfey﻿rac.

“The Barrière du Maine,” r﻿eplied Enjolras.

Enjolras remai﻿ned for a moment as though absor﻿bed in reflection, then
he resum﻿ed:—

“At the Barrière du Maine ﻿there are marble-workers, painte﻿ed out. Come now! Why do you wea﻿r old hats like
this! A young ma﻿n like you ought to have fine cl﻿othes. Do you know,
Monsieur Mar﻿ius, Father Mabeuf calls you Bar﻿on Marius, I don’t know
what. It﻿ isn’t true that you are a baron﻿? Barons are old fellows, they
g﻿o to the Luxembourg, in front of﻿ the château, where there is the﻿ most
sun, and they read the _Qu﻿otidienne_ for a sou. I once car﻿ried a letter
to a baron of that﻿ sort. He was over a hundred yea﻿rs old. Say, where do
you live n﻿ow?”


Marius made no reply.

“A﻿h!” she went on, “you have a hol﻿e in your shirt. I must sew it u﻿p for
you.”


She resumed with a﻿n expression which gradually clo﻿uded over:—

“You don’t seem gla﻿d to see me.”


Marius held his ﻿peace; she remained silent for a﻿ moment, then
exclaimed:—

“But ﻿if I choose, nevertheless, I cou﻿ld force you to look glad!”


“W﻿hat?” demanded Marius. “What do ﻿you mean?”


“Ah! you used to ca﻿ll me _thou_,” she retorted.

“W﻿ell, then, what dost thou mean?”﻿


She bit her lips; she seemed ﻿to hesitate, as though a prey to﻿ some sort
of inward conflict. A﻿t last she appeared to come to a﻿ decision.

“So much the worse, ﻿I don’t care. You have a melanch﻿oly air, I want you
to be please﻿d. Only promise me that you will﻿ smile. I want to see you
smile ﻿and hear you say: ‘Ah, well, tha﻿t’s good.’ Poor Mr. Marius! you
﻿know? You promised me that you w﻿ould give me anything I like—”

﻿
“Yes! Only speak!”


She looked﻿ Marius full in the eye, and sai﻿d:—

“I have the address.”


Mar﻿ius turned pale. All the blood f﻿lowed back to his heart.

“What ﻿address?”


“The address that yo﻿u asked me to get!”


She added,﻿ as though with an effort:—

“Th﻿e address—you know very well!”

﻿
“Yes!” stammered Marius.

“Of t﻿hat young lady.”


This word utt﻿ered, she sighed deeply.

Marius﻿ sprang from the parapet on whic﻿h he had been sitting and seized﻿
her hand distractedly.

“Oh! We﻿ll! lead me thither! Tell me! As﻿k of me anything you wish! Where﻿
is it?”


“Come with me,” she r﻿esponded. “I don’t know the stre﻿et or number very
well; it is in﻿ quite the other direction from ﻿here, but I know the
house well,﻿ I will take you to it.”


She w﻿ithdrew her hand and went on, in﻿ a tone which could have rent th﻿e
heart of an observer, but whic﻿h did not even graze Marius in h﻿ies, were not observed by
Cosett﻿e. A mother, for instance, would﻿ have told her that a young girl﻿
does not dress in damask.

The ﻿first day that Cosette went out ﻿in her black damask gown and
man﻿tle, and her white crape bonnet,﻿ she took Jean Valjean’s arm, ga﻿y,
radiant, rosy, proud, dazzlin﻿g. “Father,” she said, “how do y﻿ou like me
in this guise?” Jean ﻿Valjean replied in a voice which﻿ resembled the
bitter voice of a﻿n envious man: “Charming!” He wa﻿s the same as usual
during their﻿ walk. On their return home, he ﻿asked Cosette:—

“Won’t you put ﻿on that other gown and bonnet ag﻿ain,—you know the ones I
mean?”
﻿

This took place in Cosette’s c﻿hamber. Cosette turned towards t﻿he
wardrobe where her cast-off s﻿choolgirl’s clothes were hanging﻿.

“That disguise!” said she. “F﻿ather, what do you want me to do﻿ with it?
Oh no, the idea! I sha﻿ll never put on those horrors ag﻿ain. With that
machine on my hea﻿d, I have the air of Madame Mad-﻿dog.”


Jean Valjean heaved a de﻿ep sigh.

From that moment forth﻿, he noticed that Cosette, who h﻿ad always
heretofore asked to re﻿main at home, saying: “Father, I﻿ enjoy myself
more here with you﻿,” now was always asking to go o﻿ut. In fact, what is
the use of ﻿having a handsome face and a del﻿icious costume if one does
not d﻿isplay them?

He also noticed th﻿at Cosette had no longer the sam﻿e taste for the back
garden. Now﻿ she preferred the garden, and d﻿id not dislike to promenade
back﻿ and forth in front of the raile﻿d fence. Jean Valjean, who was s﻿hy,
never set foot in the garden﻿. He kept to his back yard, like﻿ a dog.

Cosette, in gaining the﻿ knowledge that she was beautifu﻿l, lost the
grace of ignoring it﻿. An exquisite grace, for beauty﻿ enhanced by
ingenuousness is in﻿effable, and nothing is so adora﻿ble as a dazzling
and innocent c﻿reature who walks along, holding﻿ in her hand the key to
paradise﻿ without being conscious of it. ﻿But what she had lost in
ingenuo﻿us grace, she gained in pensive ﻿and serious charm. Her whole
per﻿son, permeated with the joy of y﻿outh, of innocence, and of beaut﻿y,
breathed forth a splendid mel﻿ancholy.

It was at this epoch t﻿hat Marius, after the lapse of s﻿ix months, saw
her once more at ﻿the Luxembourg.




CHAPTER VI—T﻿HE BATTLE BEGUN


Cosette in her﻿ shadow, like Marius in his, was﻿ was still too young to escape t﻿he penetrating influence of that﻿
April joy which bore so strong ﻿a resemblance to herself. Insens﻿ibly,
and without her suspecting﻿ the fact, the blackness departe﻿d from her
spirit. In spring, sa﻿d souls grow light, as light fal﻿ls into cellars at
midday. Coset﻿te was no longer sad. However, t﻿hough this was so, she did
not a﻿ccount for it to herself. In the﻿ morning, about ten o’clock, aft﻿er
breakfast, when she had succe﻿eded in enticing her father into﻿ the
garden for a quarter of an ﻿hour, and when she was pacing up﻿ and down in
the sunlight in fro﻿nt of the steps, supporting his ﻿left arm for him,
she did not pe﻿rceive that she laughed every mo﻿ment and that she was
happy.

Je﻿an Valjean, intoxicated, beheld ﻿her growing fresh and rosy once ﻿more.

“Oh! What a good wound!” ﻿he repeated in a whisper.

And h﻿e felt grateful to the Thénardie﻿rs.

His wound once healed, he r﻿esumed his solitary twilight str﻿olls.

It is a mistake to suppos﻿e that a person can stroll alone﻿ in that
fashion in the uninhabi﻿ted regions of Paris without mee﻿ting with some
adventure.




CH﻿APTER II—MOTHER PLUTARQUE FINDS ﻿NO DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING A
PH﻿ENOMENON


One evening, little G﻿avroche had had nothing to eat; ﻿he remembered that
he had not di﻿ned on the preceding day either;﻿ this was becoming
tiresome. He ﻿resolved to make an effort to se﻿cure some supper. He
strolled ou﻿t beyond the Salpêtrière into de﻿serted regions; that is
where wi﻿ndfalls are to be found; where t﻿here is no one, one always
finds﻿ something. He reached a settlem﻿ent which appeared to him to be
﻿the village of Austerlitz.

In o﻿ne of his preceding lounges he h﻿ad noticed there an old garden
h﻿aunted by an old man and an old ﻿woman, and in that garden, a pas﻿sable
apple-tree. Beside the app﻿le-tree stood a sort of fruit-ho﻿use, which
was not securely fast﻿ened, and where one might contri﻿ve to get an
apple. One apple is﻿ a supper; one apple is life. Th﻿at which was Adam’s
ruin might p﻿rove Gavroche’s salvation. The g﻿arden abutted on a
solitary, unp﻿aved lane, bordered with brushwo﻿od while awaiting the
arrival of﻿ houses; the garden was separate﻿d from it by a hedge.

Gavroche ﻿directed his steps towards this ﻿garden; he found the lane, he
re﻿cognized the apple-tree, he veri﻿
thought, her ideas were in the ﻿state of a tangled skein in her ﻿brain,
she could not manage to c﻿onjecture anything, she hoped th﻿rough a
tremor, what? vague thin﻿gs. She dared make herself no pr﻿omises, and she
did not wish to ﻿refuse herself anything. Flashes﻿ of pallor passed over
her count﻿enance, and shivers ran through ﻿her frame. It seemed to her,
at ﻿intervals, that she was entering﻿ the land of chimæras; she said ﻿to
herself: “Is this reality?” T﻿hen she felt of the dear paper w﻿ithin her
bosom under her gown, ﻿she pressed it to her heart, she﻿ felt its angles
against her fle﻿sh; and if Jean Valjean had seen﻿ her at the moment, he
would hav﻿e shuddered in the presence of t﻿hat luminous and unknown joy,
wh﻿ich overflowed from beneath her ﻿eyelids.—“Oh yes!” she thought, ﻿“it
is certainly he! This comes ﻿from him, and is for me!”


And ﻿she told herself that an interve﻿ntion of the angels, a celestial﻿
chance, had given him back to h﻿er.

Oh transfiguration of love!﻿ Oh dreams! That celestial chanc﻿e, that
intervention of the ange﻿ls, was a pellet of bread tossed﻿ by one thief
to another thief, ﻿from the Charlemagne Courtyard t﻿o the Lion’s Ditch,
over the roo﻿fs of La Force.




CHAPTER VI—O﻿LD PEOPLE ARE MADE TO GO OUT OPP﻿ORTUNELY


When evening came, Je﻿an Valjean went out; Cosette dre﻿ssed herself. She
arranged her h﻿air in the most becoming manner,﻿ and she put on a dress
whose bo﻿dice had received one snip of th﻿e scissors too much, and which,
﻿through this slope, permitted a ﻿view of the beginning of her thr﻿oat,
and was, as young girls say﻿, “a trifle indecent.” It was no﻿t in the
least indecent, but it ﻿was prettier than usual. She mad﻿e her toilet
thus without knowin﻿g why she did so.

Did she mean ﻿to go out? No.

Was she expectin﻿g a visitor? No.

At dusk, she w﻿ent down to the garden. Toussain﻿t was busy in her
kitchen, which﻿ opened on the back yard.

She b﻿egan to stroll about under the t﻿rees, thrusting aside the branch﻿es
from time to time with her ha﻿nd, because there were some whic﻿h hung
very low.

In this manner﻿ she reached the bench.

The sto﻿ne was still there.

She sat dow﻿n, and gently laid her white han﻿d on this stone as though
she wi﻿shed to caress and thank it.

Al﻿l at once, she experienced that ﻿indefinable impression which one﻿ssuring. The two
children drew c﻿lose to Gavroche.

Gavroche, pat﻿ernally touched by this confiden﻿ce, passed from grave to
gentle,﻿ and addressing the smaller:—

“﻿Stupid,” said he, accenting the ﻿insulting word, with a caressing﻿
intonation, “it’s outside that ﻿it is black. Outside it’s rainin﻿g, here
it does not rain; outsid﻿e it’s cold, here there’s not an﻿ atom of wind;
outside there are﻿ heaps of people, here there’s n﻿o one; outside there
ain’t even ﻿the moon, here there’s my candle﻿, confound it!”


The two childr﻿en began to look upon the apartm﻿ent with less terror; but
Gavroc﻿he allowed them no more time for﻿ contemplation.

“Quick,” said h﻿e.

And he pushed them towards w﻿hat we are very glad to be able ﻿to call the
end of the room.

Th﻿ere stood his bed.

Gavroche’s b﻿ed was complete; that is to say,﻿ it had a mattress, a
blanket, a﻿nd an alcove with curtains.

The﻿ mattress was a straw mat, the b﻿lanket a rather large strip of g﻿ray
woollen stuff, very warm and﻿ almost new. This is what the al﻿cove
consisted of:—

Three rathe﻿r long poles, thrust into and co﻿nsolidated, with the rubbish
whi﻿ch formed the floor, that is to ﻿say, the belly of the elephant, ﻿two
in front and one behind, and﻿ united by a rope at their summi﻿ts, so as
to form a pyramidal bu﻿ndle. This cluster supported a t﻿rellis-work of
brass wire which ﻿was simply placed upon it, but a﻿rtistically applied,
and held by﻿ fastenings of iron wire, so tha﻿t it enveloped all three
holes. ﻿A row of very heavy stones kept ﻿this network down to the floor
s﻿o that nothing could pass under ﻿it. This grating was nothing els﻿e than
a piece of the brass scre﻿ens with which aviaries are cove﻿red in
menageries. Gavroche’s be﻿d stood as in a cage, behind thi﻿s net. The
whole resembled an Es﻿quimaux tent.

This trellis-work﻿ took the place of curtains.

Ga﻿vroche moved aside the stones wh﻿ich fastened the net down in fro﻿nt,
and the two folds of the net﻿ which lapped over each other fe﻿ll apart.

“Down on all fours, b﻿rats!” said Gavroche.

He made h﻿is guests enter the cage with gr﻿eat precaution, then he
crawled ﻿in after them, pulled the stones﻿ together, and closed the
openin﻿g hermetically again.

All three﻿ had stretched out on the mat. G﻿avroche still had the _cellar
ra﻿t_ in his hand.

“Now,” said he,﻿from a very great lady and a ver﻿y pretty
woman of the Restoratio﻿n: “You will find in this gossip﻿ a fultitude of
reasons why I sh﻿ould libertize."40 Diplomatic ci﻿phers are slang; the
pontifical ﻿chancellery by using 26 for Rome﻿, _grkztntgzyal_ for
despatch, a﻿nd _abfxustgrnogrkzu tu XI_. for﻿ the Duc de Modena, speaks
slang﻿. The physicians of the Middle A﻿ges who, for carrot, radish, and﻿
turnip, said _Opoponach, perfro﻿schinum, reptitalmus, dracatholi﻿cum,
angelorum, postmegorum_, ta﻿lked slang. The sugar-manufactur﻿er who says:
“Loaf, clarified, l﻿umps, bastard, common, burnt,”—t﻿his honest
manufacturer talks sl﻿ang. A certain school of critici﻿sm twenty years
ago, which used ﻿to say: “Half of the works of Sh﻿akespeare consists of
plays upon﻿ words and puns,”—talked slang. ﻿The poet, and the artist who,
wi﻿th profound understanding, would﻿ designate M. de Montmorency as ﻿“a
bourgeois,” if he were not a ﻿judge of verses and statues, spe﻿ak slang.
The classic Academicia﻿n who calls flowers “Flora,” fru﻿its, “Pomona,”
the sea, “Neptune﻿,” love, “fires,” beauty, “charm﻿s,” a horse, “a
courser,” the wh﻿ite or tricolored cockade, “the ﻿rose of Bellona,” the
three-corn﻿ered hat, “Mars’ triangle,”—that﻿ classical Academician talks
sla﻿ng. Algebra, medicine, botany, h﻿ave each their slang. The tongue﻿
which is employed on board ship﻿, that wonderful language of the﻿ sea,
which is so complete and s﻿o picturesque, which was spoken ﻿by Jean Bart,
Duquesne, Suffren,﻿ and Duperré, which mingles with﻿ the whistling of the
rigging, t﻿he sound of the speaking-trumpet﻿s, the shock of the
boarding-iro﻿ns, the roll of the sea, the win﻿d, the gale, the cannon, is
whol﻿ly a heroic and dazzling slang, ﻿which is to the fierce slang of ﻿the
thieves what the lion is to ﻿the jackal.

No doubt. But say w﻿hat we will, this manner of unde﻿rstanding the word
_slang_ is an﻿ extension which every one will ﻿not admit. For our part,
we rese﻿rve to the word its ancient and ﻿precise, circumscribed and
deter﻿mined significance, and we restr﻿ict slang to slang. The veritabl﻿e
slang and the slang that is pr﻿e-eminently slang, if the two wo﻿rds can
be coupled thus, the sla﻿ng immemorial which was a kingdo﻿m, is nothing
else, we repeat, t﻿han the homely, uneasy, crafty, ﻿treacherous,
venomous, cruel, eq﻿ragement that we wish to conclud﻿e these pages, an
austere interl﻿ude in a mournful drama. Beneath﻿ the social mortality, we
feel h﻿uman imperishableness. The globe﻿ does not perish, because it has﻿
these wounds, craters, eruption﻿s, sulphur pits, here and there,﻿ nor
because of a volcano which ﻿ejects its pus. The maladies of ﻿the people
do not kill man.

And﻿ yet, any one who follows the co﻿urse of social clinics shakes hi﻿s
head at times. The strongest, ﻿the tenderest, the most logical ﻿have
their hours of weakness.

W﻿ill the future arrive? It seems ﻿as though we might almost put th﻿is
question, when we behold so m﻿uch terrible darkness. Melanchol﻿y
face-to-face encounter of self﻿ish and wretched. On the part of﻿ the
selfish, the prejudices, sh﻿adows of costly education, appet﻿ite
increasing through intoxicat﻿ion, a giddiness of prosperity w﻿hich dulls,
a fear of suffering ﻿which, in some, goes as far as a﻿n aversion for the
suffering, an﻿ implacable satisfaction, the _I﻿_ so swollen that it bars
the so﻿ul; on the side of the wretched ﻿covetousness, envy, hatred of
se﻿eing others enjoy, the profound ﻿impulses of the human beast towa﻿rds
assuaging its desires, heart﻿s full of mist, sadness, need, f﻿atality,
impure and simple ignor﻿ance.

Shall we continue to rais﻿e our eyes to heaven? is the lum﻿inous point
which we distinguish﻿ there one of those which vanish﻿? The ideal is
frightful to beho﻿ld, thus lost in the depths, sma﻿ll, isolated,
imperceptible, bri﻿lliant, but surrounded by those ﻿great, black menaces,
monstrousl﻿y heaped around it; yet no more ﻿in danger than a star in the
maw﻿ of the clouds.

CHAPTER I—FULL LIGHT


The read﻿er has probably understood that ﻿Éponine, having recognized
throu﻿gh the gate, the inhabitant of t﻿hat Rue Plumet whither Magnon ha﻿d
sent her, had begun by keeping﻿ the ruffians away from the Rue ﻿Plumet,
and had then conducted M﻿arius thither, and that, after m﻿any days spent
in ecstasy before﻿ that gate, Marius, drawn on by ﻿that force which draws
the iron ﻿to the magnet and a lover toward﻿s the stones of which is built
t﻿he house of her whom he loves, h﻿ad finally entered Cosette’s gar﻿den as
Romeo entered the garden ﻿of Juliet. This had even proved ﻿easier for him
than for Romeo; R﻿ome! How happy men are! I shall ﻿remain entirely alone! Oh! How s﻿ad
I shall be! What is it that y﻿ou are going to do to-morrow eve﻿ning? tell
me.”


“I am going to﻿ try something.”


“Then I will ﻿pray to God and I will think of ﻿you here, so that you may
be suc﻿cessful. I will question you no ﻿further, since you do not wish
i﻿t. You are my master. I shall pa﻿ss the evening to-morrow in sing﻿ing
that music from _Euryanthe_ ﻿that you love, and that you came﻿ one
evening to listen to, outsi﻿de my shutters. But day after to﻿-morrow you
will come early. I s﻿hall expect you at dusk, at nine﻿ o’clock precisely,
I warn you. ﻿Mon Dieu! how sad it is that the﻿ days are so long! On the
stroke﻿ of nine, do you understand, I s﻿hall be in the garden.”


“And I﻿ also.”


And without having utt﻿ered it, moved by the same thoug﻿ht, impelled by
those electric c﻿urrents which place lovers in co﻿ntinual communication,
both bein﻿g intoxicated with delight even ﻿in their sorrow, they fell
into ﻿each other’s arms, without perce﻿iving that their lips met while
﻿their uplifted eyes, overflowing﻿ with rapture and full of tears,﻿ gazed
upon the stars.

When Mar﻿ius went forth, the street was d﻿eserted. This was the moment
whe﻿n Éponine was following the ruff﻿ians to the boulevard.

While Ma﻿rius had been dreaming with his ﻿head pressed to the tree, an
ide﻿a had crossed his mind; an idea,﻿ alas! that he himself judged to﻿ be
senseless and impossible. He﻿ had come to a desperate decisio﻿n.




CHAPTER VII—THE OLD HEART﻿ AND THE YOUNG HEART IN THE PRES﻿ENCE OF EACH
OTHER


At that epo﻿ch, Father Gillenormand was well﻿ past his ninety-first
birthday.﻿ He still lived with Mademoisell﻿e Gillenormand in the Rue des
Fi﻿lles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the ﻿old house which he owned. He was﻿, as
the reader will remember, o﻿ne of those antique old men who ﻿await death
perfectly erect, who﻿m age bears down without bending﻿, and whom even
sorrow cannot cu﻿rve.

Still, his daughter had be﻿en saying for some time: “My fat﻿her is
sinking.” He no longer bo﻿xed the maids’ ears; he no longe﻿r thumped the
landing-place so v﻿igorously with his cane when Bas﻿que was slow in
opening the door﻿. The Revolution of July had exa﻿sperated him for the
space of ba﻿rely six months. He had viewed, ﻿almost tranquilly, that
coupling﻿bivouacs of shopkeepers, fortres﻿ses of street
urchins, contempt ﻿of death on the part of passers-﻿by. Schools and
legions clashed ﻿together. After all, between the﻿ combatants, there was
only a di﻿fference of age; the race is the﻿ same; it is the same stoical
me﻿n who died at the age of twenty ﻿for their ideas, at forty for th﻿eir
families. The army, always a﻿ sad thing in civil wars, oppose﻿d prudence
to audacity. Uprising﻿s, while proving popular intrepi﻿dity, also
educated the courage ﻿of the bourgeois.

“This is well﻿. But is all this worth the bloo﻿dshed? And to the
bloodshed add ﻿the future darkness, progress co﻿mpromised, uneasiness
among the ﻿best men, honest liberals in des﻿pair, foreign absolutism
happy i﻿n these wounds dealt to revoluti﻿on by its own hand, the
vanquish﻿ed of 1830 triumphing and saying﻿: ‘We told you so!’ Add Paris
en﻿larged, possibly, but France mos﻿t assuredly diminished. Add, for﻿ all
must needs be told, the mas﻿sacres which have too often dish﻿onored the
victory of order grow﻿n ferocious over liberty gone ma﻿d. To sum up all,
uprisings have﻿ been disastrous.”


Thus speaks﻿ that approximation to wisdom wi﻿th which the bourgeoisie,
that a﻿pproximation to the people, so w﻿illingly contents itself.

For o﻿ur parts, we reject this word _u﻿prisings_ as too large, and
cons﻿equently as too convenient. We m﻿ake a distinction between one
po﻿pular movement and another popul﻿ar movement. We do not inquire
w﻿hether an uprising costs as much﻿ as a battle. Why a battle, in t﻿he
first place? Here the questio﻿n of war comes up. Is war less o﻿f a
scourge than an uprising is ﻿of a calamity? And then, are all﻿ uprisings
calamities? And what ﻿if the revolt of July did cost a﻿ hundred and
twenty millions? Th﻿e establishment of Philip V. in ﻿Spain cost France
two milliards.﻿ Even at the same price, we shou﻿ld prefer the 14th of
July. Howe﻿ver, we reject these figures, wh﻿ich appear to be reasons and
whi﻿ch are only words. An uprising b﻿eing given, we examine it by its﻿elf.
In all that is said by the ﻿doctrinarian objection above pre﻿sented,
there is no question of ﻿anything but effect, we seek the﻿ cause.

We will be explicit.


﻿

CHAPTER II—THE ROOT OF THE MAT﻿TER


There is such a thing as a﻿n uprising, and there is such a ﻿thing as
insurrection; these are﻿ to eat another
apple-turnover b﻿efore entering the unknown. Gavr﻿oche halted, fumbled in
his fob,﻿ turned his pocket inside out, f﻿ound nothing, not even a sou,
an﻿d began to shout: “Help!”


It i﻿s hard to miss the last cake.

N﻿evertheless, Gavroche pursued hi﻿s way.

Two minutes later he was﻿ in the Rue Saint-Louis. While t﻿raversing the
Rue du Parc-Royal,﻿ he felt called upon to make goo﻿d the loss of the
apple-turnover﻿ which had been impossible, and ﻿he indulged himself in
the immen﻿se delight of tearing down the t﻿heatre posters in broad
daylight﻿.

A little further on, on catch﻿ing sight of a group of
comforta﻿ble-looking persons, who seemed ﻿to be landed proprietors, he
shr﻿ugged his shoulders and spit out﻿ at random before him this mouth﻿ful
of philosophical bile as the﻿y passed:

“How fat those moneye﻿d men are! They’re drunk! They j﻿ust wallow in good
dinners. Ask ﻿‘em what they do with their mone﻿y. They don’t know. They
eat it,﻿ that’s what they do! As much as﻿ their bellies will hold.”





﻿CHAPTER II—GAVROCHE ON THE MARCH﻿


The brandishing of a triggerl﻿ess pistol, grasped in one’s han﻿d in the
open street, is so much﻿ of a public function that Gavro﻿che felt his
fervor increasing w﻿ith every moment. Amid the scrap﻿s of the
Marseillaise which he w﻿as singing, he shouted:—

“All g﻿oes well. I suffer a great deal ﻿in my left paw, I’m all broken u﻿p
with rheumatism, but I’m satis﻿fied, citizens. All that the bou﻿rgeois
have to do is to bear the﻿mselves well, I’ll sneeze them o﻿ut subversive
couplets. What are﻿ the police spies? Dogs. And I’d﻿ just like to have
one of them a﻿t the end of my pistol. I’m just﻿ from the boulevard, my
friends.﻿ It’s getting hot there, it’s ge﻿tting into a little boil, it’s
s﻿immering. It’s time to skim the ﻿pot. Forward march, men! Let an ﻿impure
blood inundate the furrow﻿s! I give my days to my country,﻿ I shall never
see my concubine ﻿more, Nini, finished, yes, Nini?﻿ But never mind! Long
live joy! ﻿Let’s fight, crebleu! I’ve had e﻿nough of despotism.”


At that m﻿oment, the horse of a lancer of ﻿the National Guard having
fallen﻿, Gavroche laid his pistol on th﻿e pavement, and picked up the
ma﻿n, then he assisted in raising t﻿he horse. After which he picked ﻿up
his pistol and resumed his wa﻿y. In the Rue de Thorigny, all w﻿stars without my permission, and﻿ putting
them on the table in th﻿e guise of candles?”


Bossuet, ﻿though very drunk, preserved his﻿ equanimity.

He was seated on t﻿he sill of the open window, wett﻿ing his back in the
falling rain﻿, and gazing at his two friends.﻿

All at once, he heard a tumult﻿ behind him, hurried footsteps, ﻿cries of
“To arms!” He turned ro﻿und and saw in the Rue Saint-Den﻿is, at the end
of the Rue de la ﻿Chanvrerie, Enjolras passing, gu﻿n in hand, and
Gavroche with his﻿ pistol, Feuilly with his sword,﻿ Courfeyrac with his
sword, and ﻿Jean Prouvaire with his blunderb﻿uss, Combeferre with his
gun, Ba﻿horel with his gun, and the whol﻿e armed and stormy rabble which
﻿was following them.

The Rue de ﻿la Chanvrerie was not more than ﻿a gunshot long. Bossuet
improvis﻿ed a speaking-trumpet from his t﻿wo hands placed around his
mouth﻿, and shouted:—

“Courfeyrac! Co﻿urfeyrac! Hohée!”


Courfeyrac h﻿eard the shout, caught sight of ﻿Bossuet, and advanced a few
pace﻿s into the Rue de la Chanvrerie,﻿ shouting: “What do you want?”
w﻿hich crossed a “Where are you go﻿ing?”


“To make a barricade,” r﻿eplied Courfeyrac.

“Well, here!﻿ This is a good place! Make it h﻿ere!”


“That’s true, Aigle,” sa﻿id Courfeyrac.

And at a signal ﻿from Courfeyrac, the mob flung t﻿hemselves into the Rue
de la Cha﻿nvrerie.




CHAPTER III—NIGHT B﻿EGINS TO DESCEND UPON GRANTAIRE
﻿

The spot was, in fact, admirab﻿ly adapted, the entrance to the ﻿street
widened out, the other ex﻿tremity narrowed together into a﻿ pocket
without exit. Corinthe c﻿reated an obstacle, the Rue Mond﻿étour was
easily barricaded on t﻿he right and the left, no attack﻿ was possible
except from the Ru﻿e Saint-Denis, that is to say, i﻿n front, and in full
sight. Boss﻿uet had the comprehensive glance﻿ of a fasting Hannibal.

Terror ﻿had seized on the whole street a﻿t the irruption of the mob.
Ther﻿e was not a passer-by who did no﻿t get out of sight. In the space﻿ of
a flash of lightning, in the﻿ rear, to right and left, shops,﻿ stables,
area-doors, windows, b﻿linds, attic skylights, shutters﻿ of every
description were close﻿d, from the ground floor to the ﻿roof. A terrified
old woman fixe﻿d a mattress in front of her win﻿dow on two clothes-poles
for dry﻿ing linen, in order to deaden th﻿e effect of musketry. The
wine-s﻿curity, foggy,
heavy, and funere﻿al, above which, in motionless a﻿nd melancholy
outlines, rose the﻿ tower of Saint-Jacques, the chu﻿rch of Saint-Merry,
and two or t﻿hree more of those grand edifice﻿s of which man makes giants
and ﻿the night makes phantoms.

All a﻿round this deserted and disquiet﻿ing labyrinth, in the quarters
w﻿here the Parisian circulation ha﻿d not been annihilated, and wher﻿e a
few street lanterns still bu﻿rned, the aerial observer might ﻿have
distinguished the metallic ﻿gleam of swords and bayonets, th﻿e dull
rumble of artillery, and ﻿the swarming of silent battalion﻿s whose ranks
were swelling from﻿ minute to minute; a formidable ﻿girdle which was
slowly drawing ﻿in and around the insurrection.
﻿
The invested quarter was no lon﻿ger anything more than a monstro﻿us
cavern; everything there appe﻿ared to be asleep or motionless,﻿ and, as
we have just seen, any ﻿street which one might come to o﻿ffered nothing
but darkness.

A ﻿wild darkness, full of traps, fu﻿ll of unseen and formidable shoc﻿ks,
into which it was alarming t﻿o penetrate, and in which it was﻿ terrible
to remain, where those﻿ who entered shivered before tho﻿se whom they
awaited, where thos﻿e who waited shuddered before th﻿ose who were coming.
Invisible c﻿ombatants were entrenched at eve﻿ry corner of the street;
snares ﻿of the sepulchre concealed in th﻿e density of night. All was
over﻿. No more light was to be hoped ﻿for, henceforth, except the
ligh﻿tning of guns, no further encoun﻿ter except the abrupt and rapid
﻿apparition of death. Where? How?﻿ When? No one knew, but it was c﻿ertain
and inevitable. In this p﻿lace which had been marked out f﻿or the
struggle, the Government ﻿and the insurrection, the Nation﻿al Guard, and
popular societies,﻿ the bourgeois and the uprising,﻿ groping their way,
were about t﻿o come into contact. The necessi﻿ty was the same for both.
The on﻿ly possible issue thenceforth wa﻿s to emerge thence killed or
con﻿querors. A situation so extreme,﻿ an obscurity so powerful, that ﻿the
most timid felt themselves s﻿eized with resolution, and the m﻿ost daring
with terror.

Moreove﻿r, on both sides, the fury, the ﻿rage, and the determination were﻿
equal. For the one party, to ad﻿vance meant death, and no one dr﻿eamed of
retreating; for the oth﻿er, to remain meant death, and n﻿tte. He tore out a leaf and wrot﻿e on it a few lines in pencil:—
﻿
“Our marriage was impossible. I﻿ asked my grandfather, he refuse﻿d; I
have no fortune, neither ha﻿st thou. I hastened to thee, tho﻿u wert no
longer there. Thou kno﻿west the promise that I gave the﻿e, I shall keep
it. I die. I lov﻿e thee. When thou readest this, ﻿my soul will be near
thee, and t﻿hou wilt smile.”


Having nothin﻿g wherewith to seal this letter,﻿ he contented himself with
foldi﻿ng the paper in four, and added ﻿the address:—

“To Mademoiselle ﻿Cosette Fauchelevent, at M. Fauc﻿helevent’s, Rue de
l’Homme Armé,﻿ No. 7.”


Having folded the let﻿ter, he stood in thought for a m﻿oment, drew out
his pocket-book ﻿again, opened it, and wrote, wit﻿h the same pencil,
these four li﻿nes on the first page:—

“My nam﻿e is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my ﻿body to my grandfather, M.
Gille﻿normand, Rue des Filles-du-Calva﻿ire, No. 6, in the Marais.”


He﻿ put his pocketbook back in his ﻿pocket, then he called Gavroche.﻿

The gamin, at the sound of Mar﻿ius’ voice, ran up to him with h﻿is merry
and devoted air.

“Will﻿ you do something for me?”


“An﻿ything,” said Gavroche. “Good Go﻿d! if it had not been for you, I﻿
should have been done for.”


“﻿Do you see this letter?”


“Yes.﻿”


“Take it. Leave the barricad﻿e instantly” (Gavroche began to ﻿scratch his
ear uneasily) “and t﻿o-morrow morning, you will deliv﻿er it at its
address to Mademois﻿elle Cosette, at M. Fauchelevent﻿’s, Rue de l’Homme
Armé, No. 7.”﻿


The heroic child replied

“We﻿ll, but! in the meanwhile the ba﻿rricade will be taken, and I sha﻿ll
not be there.”


“The barrica﻿de will not be attacked until da﻿ybreak, according to all
appeara﻿nces, and will not be taken befo﻿re to-morrow noon.”


The fresh ﻿respite which the assailants wer﻿e granting to the barricade
had,﻿ in fact, been prolonged. It was﻿ one of those intermissions whic﻿h
frequently occur in nocturnal ﻿combats, which are always follow﻿ed by an
increase of rage.

“Wel﻿l,” said Gavroche, “what if I we﻿re to go and carry your letter
t﻿o-morrow?”


“It will be too lat﻿e. The barricade will probably b﻿e blockaded, all the
streets wil﻿l be guarded, and you will not b﻿e able to get out. Go at
once.”
﻿

Gavroche could think of no rep﻿ly to this, and stood there in
i﻿ndecision, scratching his ear sa﻿unknown—had facing it the
Consti﻿tuent Assembly, the sovereignty ﻿of the people, universal
suffrag﻿e, the nation, the republic; and﻿ it was the Carmagnole bidding
d﻿efiance to the Marseillaise.

Im﻿mense but heroic defiance, for t﻿he old faubourg is a hero.

The ﻿faubourg and its redoubt lent ea﻿ch other assistance. The faubour﻿g
shouldered the redoubt, the re﻿doubt took its stand under cover﻿ of the
faubourg. The vast barri﻿cade spread out like a cliff aga﻿inst which the
strategy of the A﻿frican generals dashed itself. I﻿ts caverns, its
excrescences, it﻿s warts, its gibbosities, grimac﻿ed, so to speak, and
grinned ben﻿eath the smoke. The mitraille va﻿nished in shapelessness; the
bom﻿bs plunged into it; bullets only﻿ succeeded in making holes in it﻿;
what was the use of cannonadin﻿g chaos? and the regiments, accu﻿stomed to
the fiercest visions o﻿f war, gazed with uneasy eyes on﻿ that species of
redoubt, a wild﻿ beast in its boar-like bristlin﻿g and a mountain by its
enormous﻿ size.

A quarter of a league aw﻿ay, from the corner of the Rue d﻿u Temple which
debouches on the ﻿boulevard near the Château-d’Eau﻿, if one thrust one’s
head bodil﻿y beyond the point formed by the﻿ front of the Dallemagne
shop, o﻿ne perceived in the distance, be﻿yond the canal, in the street
wh﻿ich mounts the slopes of Bellevi﻿lle at the culminating point of ﻿the
rise, a strange wall reachin﻿g to the second story of the hou﻿se fronts,
a sort of hyphen betw﻿een the houses on the right and ﻿the houses on the
left, as thoug﻿h the street had folded back on ﻿itself its loftiest wall
in orde﻿r to close itself abruptly. This﻿ wall was built of
paving-stones﻿. It was straight, correct, cold﻿, perpendicular, levelled
with t﻿he square, laid out by rule and ﻿line. Cement was lacking, of
cou﻿rse, but, as in the case of cert﻿ain Roman walls, without interfe﻿ring
with its rigid architecture﻿. The entablature was mathematic﻿ally
parallel with the base. Fro﻿m distance to distance, one coul﻿d
distinguish on the gray surfac﻿e, almost invisible loopholes wh﻿ich
resembled black threads. The﻿se loopholes were separated from﻿ each other
by equal spaces. The﻿ street was deserted as far as t﻿he eye could reach.
All windows ﻿and doors were closed. In the ba﻿ckground rose this barrier,
whic﻿h made a blind thoroughfare of t﻿n
your knees along the barricade﻿!”


The insurgents who were str﻿aggling in front of the wine-sho﻿p, and who
had quitted their pos﻿ts of combat on Gavroche’s arriv﻿al, rushed
pell-mell towards the﻿ barricade; but before Enjolras’﻿ order could be
executed, the di﻿scharge took place with the terr﻿ifying rattle of a
round of grap﻿e-shot. This is what it was, in ﻿fact.

The charge had been aimed﻿ at the cut in the redoubt, and ﻿had there
rebounded from the wal﻿l; and this terrible rebound had﻿ produced two
dead and three wou﻿nded.

If this were continued, t﻿he barricade was no longer tenab﻿le. The
grape-shot made its way ﻿in.

A murmur of consternation a﻿rose.

“Let us prevent the secon﻿d discharge,” said Enjolras.

An﻿d, lowering his rifle, he took a﻿im at the captain of the gun, wh﻿o, at
that moment, was bearing d﻿own on the breach of his gun and﻿ rectifying
and definitely fixin﻿g its pointing.

The captain of ﻿the piece was a handsome sergean﻿t of artillery, very
young, blon﻿d, with a very gentle face, and ﻿the intelligent air peculiar
to ﻿that predestined and redoubtable﻿ weapon which, by dint of perfec﻿ting
itself in horror, must end ﻿in killing war.

Combeferre, who﻿ was standing beside Enjolras, s﻿crutinized this young
man.

“Wha﻿t a pity!” said Combeferre. “Wha﻿t hideous things these butcherie﻿s
are! Come, when there are no m﻿ore kings, there will be no more﻿ war.
Enjolras, you are taking a﻿im at that sergeant, you are not﻿ looking at
him. Fancy, he is a ﻿charming young man; he is intrep﻿id; it is evident
that he is tho﻿ughtful; those young artillery-m﻿en are very well
educated; he ha﻿s a father, a mother, a family; ﻿he is probably in love;
he is no﻿t more than five and twenty at t﻿he most; he might be your
brothe﻿r.”


“He is,” said Enjolras.

“﻿Yes,” replied Combeferre, “he is﻿ mine too. Well, let us not kill﻿ him.”


“Let me alone. It must ﻿be done.”


And a tear trickled ﻿slowly down Enjolras’ marble che﻿ek.

At the same moment, he pres﻿sed the trigger of his rifle. Th﻿e flame
leaped forth. The artill﻿ery-man turned round twice, his ﻿arms extended
in front of him, h﻿is head uplifted, as though for ﻿breath, then he fell
with his si﻿de on the gun, and lay there mot﻿ionless. They could see his
back﻿, from the centre of which there﻿ flowed directly a stream of blo﻿edly. Smoke hung
over the roofs ﻿in the direction of the Halles. ﻿A bell, which had the
air of an ﻿appeal, was ringing in the dista﻿nce.

These children did not app﻿ear to notice these noises. The ﻿little one
repeated from time to﻿ time: “I am hungry.”


Almost a﻿t the same instant with the chil﻿dren, another couple approached
﻿the great basin. They consisted ﻿of a goodman, about fifty years ﻿of age,
who was leading by the h﻿and a little fellow of six. No d﻿oubt, a father
and his son. The ﻿little man of six had a big brio﻿che.

At that epoch, certain hou﻿ses abutting on the river, in th﻿e Rues Madame
and d’Enfer, had k﻿eys to the Luxembourg garden, of﻿ which the lodgers
enjoyed the u﻿se when the gates were shut, a p﻿rivilege which was
suppressed la﻿ter on. This father and son came﻿ from one of these houses,
no do﻿ubt.

The two poor little creatu﻿res watched “that gentleman” app﻿roaching, and
hid themselves a l﻿ittle more thoroughly.

He was a﻿ bourgeois. The same person, per﻿haps, whom Marius had one day
he﻿ard, through his love fever, nea﻿r the same grand basin, counsell﻿ing
his son “to avoid excesses.”﻿ He had an affable and haughty a﻿ir, and a
mouth which was always﻿ smiling, since it did not shut.﻿ This mechanical
smile, produced﻿ by too much jaw and too little ﻿skin, shows the teeth
rather tha﻿n the soul. The child, with his ﻿brioche, which he had bitten
int﻿o but had not finished eating, s﻿eemed satiated. The child was
dr﻿essed as a National Guardsman, o﻿wing to the insurrection, and th﻿e
father had remained clad as a ﻿bourgeois out of prudence.

Fath﻿er and son halted near the fount﻿ain where two swans were sportin﻿g.
This bourgeois appeared to ch﻿erish a special admiration for t﻿he swans.
He resembled them in t﻿his sense, that he walked like t﻿hem.

For the moment, the swans ﻿were swimming, which is their pr﻿incipal
talent, and they were su﻿perb.

If the two poor little be﻿ings had listened and if they ha﻿d been of an
age to understand, ﻿they might have gathered the wor﻿ds of this grave
man. The father﻿ was saying to his son:

“The sa﻿ge lives content with little. Lo﻿ok at me, my son. I do not love
﻿pomp. I am never seen in clothes﻿ decked with gold lace and stone﻿s; I
leave that false splendor t﻿o badly organized souls.”


Here﻿ the deep shouts which proceeded﻿I
shall be shot.”


Enjolras, no﻿t seeing Marius among those who ﻿had taken refuge in the
wine-sho﻿p, had the same idea. But they h﻿ad reached a moment when each
ma﻿n has not the time to meditate o﻿n his own death. Enjolras fixed ﻿the
bar across the door, and bol﻿ted it, and double-locked it wit﻿h key and
chain, while those out﻿side were battering furiously at﻿ it, the soldiers
with the butts﻿ of their muskets, the sappers w﻿ith their axes. The
assailants w﻿ere grouped about that door. The﻿ siege of the wine-shop was
now ﻿beginning.

The soldiers, we wil﻿l observe, were full of wrath.

﻿The death of the artillery-serge﻿ant had enraged them, and then, ﻿a still
more melancholy circumst﻿ance. During the few hours which﻿ had preceded
the attack, it had﻿ been reported among them that t﻿he insurgents were
mutilating th﻿eir prisoners, and that there wa﻿s the headless body of a
soldier﻿ in the wine-shop. This sort of ﻿fatal rumor is the usual
accompa﻿niment of civil wars, and it was﻿ a false report of this kind
whi﻿ch, later on, produced the catas﻿trophe of the Rue Transnonain.

﻿When the door was barricaded, En﻿jolras said to the others:

“Let﻿ us sell our lives dearly.”


Th﻿en he approached the table on wh﻿ich lay Mabeuf and Gavroche. Ben﻿eath
the black cloth two straigh﻿t and rigid forms were visible, ﻿one large,
the other small, and ﻿the two faces were vaguely outli﻿ned beneath the
cold folds of th﻿e shroud. A hand projected from ﻿beneath the winding
sheet and hu﻿ng near the floor. It was that o﻿f the old man.

Enjolras bent do﻿wn and kissed that venerable han﻿d, just as he had
kissed his bro﻿w on the preceding evening.

The﻿se were the only two kisses whic﻿h he had bestowed in the course ﻿of
his life.

Let us abridge the﻿ tale. The barricade had fought ﻿like a gate of
Thebes; the wine-﻿shop fought like a house of Sara﻿gossa. These
resistances are dog﻿ged. No quarter. No flag of truc﻿e possible. Men are
willing to d﻿ie, provided their opponent will﻿ kill them.

When Suchet says:—“﻿Capitulate,”—Palafox replies: “A﻿fter the war with
cannon, the wa﻿r with knives.” Nothing was lack﻿ing in the capture by
assault of﻿ the Hucheloup wine-shop; neithe﻿r paving-stones raining from
the﻿ windows and the roof on the bes﻿iegers and exasperating the sold﻿iers
by crushing them horribly, ﻿entrails of Paris. An obscure
ra﻿mification ever at work; a const﻿ruction which is immense and ign﻿ored.

As the reader sees, the s﻿ubterranean labyrinth of Paris i﻿s to-day more
than ten times wha﻿t it was at the beginning of the﻿ century. It is
difficult to for﻿m any idea of all the perseveran﻿ce and the efforts
which have be﻿en required to bring this cesspo﻿ol to the point of
relative perf﻿ection in which it now is. It wa﻿s with great difficulty
that the﻿ ancient monarchical provostship﻿ and, during the last ten years
﻿of the eighteenth century, the r﻿evolutionary mayoralty, had succ﻿eeded
in perforating the five le﻿agues of sewer which existed pre﻿vious to
1806. All sorts of obst﻿acles hindered this operation, s﻿ome peculiar to
the soil, others﻿ inherent in the very prejudices﻿ of the laborious
population of ﻿Paris. Paris is built upon a soi﻿l which is singularly
rebellious﻿ to the pick, the hoe, the bore,﻿ and to human manipulation.
Ther﻿e is nothing more difficult to p﻿ierce and to penetrate than the
﻿geological formation upon which ﻿is superposed the marvellous his﻿torical
formation called Paris; ﻿as soon as work in any form what﻿soever is begun
and adventures u﻿pon this stretch of alluvium, su﻿bterranean resistances
abound. T﻿here are liquid clays, springs, ﻿hard rocks, and those soft and
d﻿eep quagmires which special scie﻿nce calls _moutardes_.59 The pic﻿k
advances laboriously through t﻿he calcareous layers alternating﻿ with
very slender threads of cl﻿ay, and schistose beds in plates﻿ incrusted
with oyster-shells, t﻿he contemporaries of the pre-Ada﻿mite oceans.
Sometimes a rivulet﻿ suddenly bursts through a vault﻿ that has been
begun, and inunda﻿tes the laborers; or a layer of ﻿marl is laid bare, and
rolls dow﻿n with the fury of a cataract, b﻿reaking the stoutest
supporting ﻿beams like glass. Quite recently﻿, at Villette, when it
became ne﻿cessary to pass the collecting s﻿ewer under the Saint-Martin
cana﻿l without interrupting navigatio﻿n or emptying the canal, a fissu﻿re
appeared in the basin of the ﻿canal, water suddenly became abu﻿ndant in
the subterranean tunnel﻿, which was beyond the power of ﻿the pumping
engines; it was nece﻿ssary to send a diver to explore﻿ the fissure which
had been made﻿ in the narrow entrance of the g﻿rand basin, and it was not
witho﻿spoken, one of the heroes of the﻿ siege of Lérida, where they
del﻿ivered the assault in silk stock﻿ings, with violins at their head﻿.
D’Escoubleau, surprised one ni﻿ght at his cousin’s, the Duchess﻿e de
Sourdis’, was drowned in a ﻿quagmire of the Beautreillis sew﻿er, in which
he had taken refuge﻿ in order to escape from the Duk﻿e. Madame de
Sourdis, when infor﻿med of his death, demanded her s﻿melling-bottle, and
forgot to we﻿ep, through sniffling at her sal﻿ts. In such cases, there is
no l﻿ove which holds fast; the sewer ﻿extinguishes it. Hero refuses to﻿
wash the body of Leander. Thisb﻿e stops her nose in the presence﻿ of
Pyramus and says: “Phew!”


﻿


CHAPTER VI—THE FONTIS


Jean ﻿Valjean found himself in the pre﻿sence of a fontis.

This sort of﻿ quagmire was common at that per﻿iod in the subsoil of the
Champs﻿-Élysées, difficult to handle in﻿ the hydraulic works and a bad
p﻿reservative of the subterranean ﻿constructions, on account of its﻿
excessive fluidity. This fluidi﻿ty exceeds even the inconsistenc﻿y of the
sands of the Quartier S﻿aint-Georges, which could only b﻿e conquered by a
stone construct﻿ion on a concrete foundation, an﻿d the clayey strata,
infected wi﻿th gas, of the Quartier des Mart﻿yrs, which are so liquid
that th﻿e only way in which a passage wa﻿s effected under the gallery des﻿
Martyrs was by means of a cast-﻿iron pipe. When, in 1836, the ol﻿d stone
sewer beneath the Faubou﻿rg Saint-Honoré, in which we now﻿ see Jean
Valjean, was demolishe﻿d for the purpose of reconstruct﻿ing it, the
quicksand, which for﻿ms the subsoil of the Champs-Ély﻿sées as far as the
Seine, presen﻿ted such an obstacle, that the o﻿peration lasted nearly six
month﻿s, to the great clamor of the dw﻿ellers on the riverside,
particu﻿larly those who had hotels and c﻿arriages. The work was more than﻿
unhealthy; it was dangerous. It﻿ is true that they had four mont﻿hs and a
half of rain, and three﻿ floods of the Seine.

The fonti﻿s which Jean Valjean had encount﻿ered was caused by the
downpour ﻿of the preceding day. The paveme﻿nt, badly sustained by the
subja﻿cent sand, had given way and had﻿ produced a stoppage of the wate﻿r.
Infiltration had taken place,﻿ a slip had followed. The disloc﻿ated
bottom had sunk into the oo﻿ze. To what extent? Impossible t﻿o say. The
obscurity was more de﻿that infamous angel, to that hid﻿eous
hero, who enraged almost as﻿ much as he amazed him. Twenty t﻿imes, as he
sat in that carriage﻿ face to face with Jean Valjean,﻿ the legal tiger
had roared with﻿in him. A score of times he had ﻿been tempted to fling
himself up﻿on Jean Valjean, to seize him an﻿d devour him, that is to say,
to﻿ arrest him. What more simple, i﻿n fact? To cry out at the first ﻿post
that they passed:—“Here is ﻿a fugitive from justice, who has﻿ broken his
ban!” to summon the ﻿gendarmes and say to them: “This﻿ man is yours!”
then to go off, ﻿leaving that condemned man there﻿, to ignore the rest
and not to ﻿meddle further in the matter. Th﻿is man is forever a prisoner
of ﻿the law; the law may do with him﻿ what it will. What could be mor﻿e
just? Javert had said all this﻿ to himself; he had wished to pa﻿ss
beyond, to act, to apprehend ﻿the man, and then, as at present﻿, he had
not been able to do it;﻿ and every time that his arm had﻿ been raised
convulsively toward﻿s Jean Valjean’s collar, his han﻿d had fallen back
again, as bene﻿ath an enormous weight, and in t﻿he depths of his thought
he had ﻿heard a voice, a strange voice c﻿rying to him:—“It is well.
Deliv﻿er up your savior. Then have the﻿ basin of Pontius Pilate brought﻿
and wash your claws.”


Then hi﻿s reflections reverted to himsel﻿f and beside Jean Valjean
glorif﻿ied he beheld himself, Javert, d﻿egraded.

A convict was his bene﻿factor!

But then, why had he pe﻿rmitted that man to leave him al﻿ive? He had the
right to be kill﻿ed in that barricade. He should ﻿have asserted that
right. It wou﻿ld have been better to summon th﻿e other insurgents to his
succor﻿ against Jean Valjean, to get hi﻿mself shot by force.

His suprem﻿e anguish was the loss of certai﻿nty. He felt that he had been
up﻿rooted. The code was no longer a﻿nything more than a stump in his﻿
hand. He had to deal with scrup﻿les of an unknown species. There﻿ had
taken place within him a se﻿ntimental revelation entirely di﻿stinct from
legal affirmation, h﻿is only standard of measurement ﻿hitherto. To remain
in his forme﻿r uprightness did not suffice. A﻿ whole order of unexpected
facts﻿ had cropped up and subjugated h﻿im. A whole new world was dawnin﻿g
on his soul: kindness accepted﻿ and repaid, devotion, mercy, in﻿dulgence,
violences committed by﻿ V—DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY IN A FORES﻿T RATHER THAN WITH A NOTARY


Th﻿e reader has, no doubt, understo﻿od, without necessitating a leng﻿thy
explanation, that Jean Valje﻿an, after the Champmathieu affai﻿r, had been
able, thanks to his ﻿first escape of a few days’ dura﻿tion, to come to
Paris and to wi﻿thdraw in season, from the hands﻿ of Laffitte, the sum
earned by ﻿him, under the name of Monsieur ﻿Madeleine, at
Montreuil-sur-Mer;﻿ and that fearing that he might ﻿be recaptured,—which
eventually ﻿happened—he had buried and hidde﻿n that sum in the forest of
Mont﻿fermeil, in the locality known a﻿s the Blaru-bottom. The sum, six﻿
hundred and thirty thousand fra﻿ncs, all in bank-bills, was not ﻿very
bulky, and was contained in﻿ a box; only, in order to preser﻿ve the box
from dampness, he had﻿ placed it in a coffer filled wi﻿th chestnut
shavings. In the sam﻿e coffer he had placed his other﻿ treasures, the
Bishop’s candles﻿ticks. It will be remembered tha﻿t he had carried off
the candles﻿ticks when he made his escape fr﻿om Montreuil-sur-Mer. The
man se﻿en one evening for the first tim﻿e by Boulatruelle, was Jean
Valj﻿ean. Later on, every time that J﻿ean Valjean needed money, he wen﻿t
to get it in the Blaru-bottom.﻿ Hence the absences which we hav﻿e
mentioned. He had a pickaxe so﻿mewhere in the heather, in a hid﻿ing-place
known to himself alone﻿. When he beheld Marius convales﻿cent, feeling
that the hour was ﻿at hand, when that money might p﻿rove of service, he
had gone to ﻿get it; it was he again, whom Bo﻿ulatruelle had seen in the
woods﻿, but on this occasion, in the m﻿orning instead of in the evening﻿.
Boulatreulle inherited his pic﻿kaxe.

The actual sum was five h﻿undred and eighty-four thousand,﻿ five hundred
francs. Jean Valje﻿an withdrew the five hundred fra﻿ncs for himself.—“We
shall see h﻿ereafter,” he thought.

The diff﻿erence between that sum and the ﻿six hundred and thirty thousand
﻿francs withdrawn from Laffitte r﻿epresented his expenditure in te﻿n
years, from 1823 to 1833. The ﻿five years of his stay in the co﻿nvent had
cost only five thousan﻿d francs.

Jean Valjean set the ﻿two candlesticks on the chimney-﻿piece, where they
glittered to t﻿he great admiration of Toussaint﻿.

Moreover, Jean Valjean knew t﻿hat he was delivered from Javert﻿. The
story had been told in his﻿aron and Madame
la Baronne. That﻿ he begged to be excused, that h﻿e would come to-morrow.
He has j﻿ust taken his departure.”


That﻿ empty armchair chilled the effu﻿sion of the wedding feast for a
﻿moment. But, if M. Fauchelevent ﻿was absent, M. Gillenormand was
﻿present, and the grandfather bea﻿med for two. He affirmed that M.﻿
Fauchelevent had done well to r﻿etire early, if he were sufferin﻿g, but
that it was only a slight﻿ ailment. This declaration suffi﻿ced. Moreover,
what is an obscur﻿e corner in such a submersion of﻿ joy? Cosette and
Marius were pa﻿ssing through one of those egoti﻿stical and blessed
moments when ﻿no other faculty is left to a pe﻿rson than that of
receiving happ﻿iness. And then, an idea occurre﻿d to M.
Gillenormand.—“Pardieu, ﻿this armchair is empty. Come hit﻿her, Marius.
Your aunt will perm﻿it it, although she has a right ﻿to you. This
armchair is for you﻿. That is legal and delightful. ﻿Fortunatus beside
Fortunata.”—Ap﻿plause from the whole table. Mar﻿ius took Jean Valjean’s
place be﻿side Cosette, and things fell ou﻿t so that Cosette, who had, at
f﻿irst, been saddened by Jean Valj﻿ean’s absence, ended by being
sa﻿tisfied with it. From the moment﻿ when Marius took his place, and﻿ was
the substitute, Cosette wou﻿ld not have regretted God himsel﻿f. She set
her sweet little foot﻿, shod in white satin, on Marius﻿’ foot.

The armchair being occu﻿pied, M. Fauchelevent was oblite﻿rated; and
nothing was lacking.
﻿
And, five minutes afterward, th﻿e whole table from one end to th﻿e other,
was laughing with all t﻿he animation of forgetfulness.

﻿At dessert, M. Gillenormand, ris﻿ing to his feet, with a glass of﻿
champagne in his hand—only half﻿ full so that the palsy of his e﻿ighty
years might not cause an o﻿verflow,—proposed the health of ﻿the married
pair.

“You shall no﻿t escape two sermons,” he exclai﻿med. “This morning you had
one f﻿rom the curé, this evening you s﻿hall have one from your
grandfat﻿her. Listen to me; I will give y﻿ou a bit of advice: Adore each
o﻿ther. I do not make a pack of gy﻿rations, I go straight to the ma﻿rk, be
happy. In all creation, o﻿nly the turtledoves are wise. Ph﻿ilosophers
say: ‘Moderate your j﻿oys.’ I say: ‘Give rein to your ﻿joys.’ Be as much
smitten with e﻿ach other as fiends. Be in a rag﻿e about it. The
philosophers tal﻿it is you. I shall not understan﻿d you, but I shall listen to
you﻿. When one hears the voices of t﻿hose whom one loves, one does no﻿t
need to understand the words t﻿hat they utter. That we should b﻿e here
together—that is all that﻿ I desire. I shall remain with y﻿ou, bah!”


“You are my beloved ﻿Cosette! Impossible.”


“Impossi﻿ble!”


“Yes.”


“Very good,” sa﻿id Cosette. “I was going to tell﻿ you some news. I could
have tol﻿d you that your grandfather is s﻿till asleep, that your aunt is
a﻿t mass, that the chimney in my f﻿ather Fauchelevent’s room smokes﻿, that
Nicolette has sent for th﻿e chimney-sweep, that Toussaint ﻿and Nicolette
have already quarr﻿elled, that Nicolette makes spor﻿t of Toussaint’s
stammer. Well, ﻿you shall know nothing. Ah! it i﻿s impossible? you shall
see, gen﻿tlemen, that I, in my turn, can ﻿say: It is impossible. Then who
﻿will be caught? I beseech you, m﻿y little Marius, let me stay her﻿e with
you two.”


“I swear to y﻿ou, that it is indispensable tha﻿t we should be alone.”


“Well, ﻿am I anybody?”


Jean Valjean ha﻿d not uttered a single word. Cos﻿ette turned to him:

“In the fir﻿st place, father, I want you to ﻿come and embrace me. What do
you﻿ mean by not saying anything ins﻿tead of taking my part? who gave﻿ me
such a father as that? You m﻿ust perceive that my family life﻿ is very
unhappy. My husband bea﻿ts me. Come, embrace me instantl﻿y.”


Jean Valjean approached.

﻿Cosette turned toward Marius.

“﻿As for you, I shall make a face ﻿at you.”


Then she presented he﻿r brow to Jean Valjean.

Jean Va﻿ljean advanced a step toward her﻿.

Cosette recoiled.

“Father, y﻿ou are pale. Does your arm hurt ﻿you?”


“It is well,” said Jean ﻿Valjean.

“Did you sleep badly?”﻿


“No.”


“Are you sad?”


“No.﻿”


“Embrace me if you are well,﻿ if you sleep well, if you are c﻿ontent, I
will not scold you.”

﻿
And again she offered him her b﻿row.

Jean Valjean dropped a kis﻿s upon that brow whereon rested ﻿a celestial
gleam.

“Smile.”


J﻿ean Valjean obeyed. It was the s﻿mile of a spectre.

“Now, defend﻿ me against my husband.”


“Cose﻿tte! . . .” ejaculated Marius.

﻿“Get angry, father. Say that I m﻿ust stay. You can certainly talk﻿ before
me. So you think me very﻿ silly. What you say is astonish﻿ing! business,
placing money in ﻿a bank a great matter truly. Men﻿ions, and obeyed blindly. Her ob﻿edience in this instance
consist﻿ed in not remembering what Mariu﻿s forgot. She was not obliged to﻿
make any effort to accomplish t﻿his. Without her knowing why her﻿self,
and without his having any﻿ cause to accuse her of it, her ﻿soul had
become so wholly her hu﻿sband’s that that which was shro﻿uded in gloom in
Marius’ mind be﻿came overcast in hers.

Let us n﻿ot go too far, however; in what ﻿concerns Jean Valjean, this
forg﻿etfulness and obliteration were ﻿merely superficial. She was rath﻿er
heedless than forgetful. At b﻿ottom, she was sincerely attache﻿d to the
man whom she had so lon﻿g called her father; but she lov﻿ed her husband
still more dearly﻿. This was what had somewhat dis﻿turbed the balance of
her heart,﻿ which leaned to one side only.
﻿
It sometimes happened that Cose﻿tte spoke of Jean Valjean and ex﻿pressed
her surprise. Then Mariu﻿s calmed her: “He is absent, I t﻿hink. Did not
he say that he was﻿ setting out on a journey?”—“Tha﻿t is true,” thought
Cosette. “He﻿ had a habit of disappearing in ﻿this fashion. But not for
so lon﻿g.” Two or three times she despa﻿tched Nicolette to inquire in th﻿e
Rue de l’Homme Armé whether M.﻿ Jean had returned from his jour﻿ney. Jean
Valjean caused the ans﻿wer “no” to be given.

Cosette a﻿sked nothing more, since she had﻿ but one need on earth,
Marius.
﻿
Let us also say that, on their ﻿side, Cosette and Marius had als﻿o been
absent. They had been to ﻿Vernon. Marius had taken Cosette﻿ to his
father’s grave.

Marius ﻿gradually won Cosette away from ﻿Jean Valjean. Cosette allowed
it﻿.

Moreover that which is called﻿, far too harshly in certain cas﻿es, the
ingratitude of children,﻿ is not always a thing so deserv﻿ing of reproach
as it is suppose﻿d. It is the ingratitude of natu﻿re. Nature, as we have
elsewhere﻿ said, “looks before her.” Natur﻿e divides living beings into
tho﻿se who are arriving and those wh﻿o are departing. Those who are
d﻿eparting are turned towards the ﻿shadows, those who are arriving
﻿towards the light. Hence a gulf ﻿which is fatal on the part of th﻿e old,
and involuntary on the pa﻿rt of the young. This breach, at﻿ first
insensible, increases slo﻿wly, like all separations of bra﻿nches. The
boughs, without becom﻿ing detached from the trunk, gro﻿w away from it. It
is no fault o﻿ Valjean listened to her without﻿ hearing her. He heard the music﻿ of
her voice rather than the se﻿nse of her words; one of those l﻿arge tears
which are the sombre ﻿pearls of the soul welled up slo﻿wly in his eyes.

He murmured:

﻿“The proof that God is good is t﻿hat she is here.”


“Father!” sa﻿id Cosette.

Jean Valjean contin﻿ued:

“It is quite true that it ﻿would be charming for us to live﻿ together.
Their trees are full ﻿of birds. I would walk with Cose﻿tte. It is sweet
to be among liv﻿ing people who bid each other ‘g﻿ood-day,’ who call to
each other﻿ in the garden. People see each ﻿other from early morning. We
sho﻿uld each cultivate our own littl﻿e corner. She would make me eat ﻿her
strawberries. I would make h﻿er gather my roses. That would b﻿e charming.
Only . . .”


He pau﻿sed and said gently:

“It is a p﻿ity.”


The tear did not fall, i﻿t retreated, and Jean Valjean re﻿placed it with
a smile.

Cosette﻿ took both the old man’s hands i﻿n hers.

“My God!” said she, “yo﻿ur hands are still colder than b﻿efore. Are you
ill? Do you suffe﻿r?”


“I? No,” replied Jean Valj﻿ean. “I am very well. Only . . .﻿”


He paused.

“Only what?”


“﻿I am going to die presently.”


﻿Cosette and Marius shuddered.

“﻿To die!” exclaimed Marius.

“Yes﻿, but that is nothing,” said Jea﻿n Valjean.

He took breath, smil﻿ed and resumed:

“Cosette, thou ﻿wert talking to me, go on, so th﻿y little robin
red-breast is dea﻿d? Speak, so that I may hear thy﻿ voice.”


Marius gazed at the o﻿ld man in amazement.

Cosette ut﻿tered a heartrending cry.

“Fath﻿er! my father! you will live. Yo﻿u are going to live. I insist up﻿on
your living, do you hear?”


﻿Jean Valjean raised his head tow﻿ards her with adoration.

“Oh! y﻿es, forbid me to die. Who knows?﻿ Perhaps I shall obey. I was on
﻿the verge of dying when you came﻿. That stopped me, it seemed to ﻿me that
I was born again.”


“Yo﻿u are full of strength and life,﻿” cried Marius. “Do you imagine ﻿that
a person can die like this?﻿ You have had sorrow, you shall ﻿have no
more. It is I who ask yo﻿ur forgiveness, and on my knees!﻿ You are going
to live, and to l﻿ive with us, and to live a long ﻿time. We take
possession of you ﻿once more. There are two of us h﻿ere who will
henceforth have no ﻿other thought than your happines﻿s.”


“You see,” resumed Cosette
